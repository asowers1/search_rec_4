films
re-open
the
toy
box
and
bring
moviegoers
back
to
the
delightful
world
of
our
favorite
gang
of
toy
characters
in
toy
story
3
.
as
andy
prepares
to
depart
for
college
buzz
woody
and
the
rest
of
his
loyal
toys
are
troubled
about
their
uncertain
future
.
toy
story
3
is
a
comical
adventure
that
lands
the
toys
in
a
room
full
of
untamed
tots
who
ca
n't
wait
to
get
their
sticky
little
fingers
on
these
``
new
''
toys
.
it
's
pandemonium
as
the
toys
try
to
stay
together
ensuring
that
``
no
toy
gets
left
behind
.
''
ts3-about
the
story
several
years
had
passed
since
toy
story
2
.
as
director
lee
unkrich
took
on
the
third
installment
he
realized
that
toy
story
3
needed
to
make
viewers
feel
like
all
three
movies
were
part
of
one
grand
story
.
the
character
of
a
corrupt
teddy
bear
and
a
day
care
storyline
were
revived
from
early
toy
story
iterations
and
the
core
conflict
had
always
seemed
inevitable
.
when
youre
broken
you
can
be
fixed
.
when
youre
lost
you
can
be
found
.
when
youre
stolen
you
can
be
recovered
.
but
theres
no
way
to
fix
being
outgrown
by
a
child
explained
executive
producer
john
lasseter
.
ts3-story
the
characters
enough
time
had
gone
by
that
viewers
needed
a
reintroduction
to
woody
buzz
and
the
rest
of
andys
toys
.
at
the
same
time
the
filmmakers
needed
to
give
purpose
and
personality
to
the
toys
that
would
inhabit
bonnies
world
and
the
day
care
center
which
included
a
plush
pink
villain

at
play
in
a
world
unconstrained
by

but
as
soon
as
the
epic
old
west-space
adventure
was
over
andy
grew
up
on
screen
through
the
eyes
of
the
toys
.
the
art
directors
even
lit
andys
room
differently
to
remind
the
audience
that
seven
plus
years
had
passed

looking
back
on
the
last
installment
of
pixars
first
film
the
pixar
team
realized
it
had
learned
a
lot
.
for
one
anything
a
person
wanted
to
put
on
the
screen
would
require
a
lot
of
other
people
to
make
it
happen
.
and
the
filmmakers
discovered
that
while
they
were
busy
making
a
film
about
toys
they
had
become
toy
makers
in
the
process
.
