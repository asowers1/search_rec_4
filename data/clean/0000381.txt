biography
rising
from
humble
beginnings
to
become
an
international
pop
star
selling
more
than
100
million
albums
worldwide
celine
dion
's
career
spanned
'90s
superstardom
and
her
more
diverse
output
in
the
2000s
and
2010s
.
born
in
charlemagne
quebec
celine
dion
was
the
youngest
in
adhemar
and
therese
dion
's
family
of
14
children
.
she
was
raised
in
a
household
filled
with
love
for
children
and
music
and
her
parents
and
siblings
were
important
figures
in
the
early
development
of
her
singing
career
.
celine
began
singing
in
her
parents
'
piano
bar
when
she
was
just
five
years
old
.
by
age
12
she
had
written
one
of
her
first
songs
``
ce
n'etait
qu'un
rãªve
''
it
was
only
a
dream
which
she
recorded
with
the
help
of
her
mother
and
brother
and
shipped
to
a
manager
named
renã
angãlil
whose
name
they
found
on
the
back
of
an
album
by
ginette
reno
a
popular
francophone
singer
.
after
weeks
with
no
response
from
angãlil
celine
's
brother
michel
phoned
him
and
said
``
i
know
you
have
n't
listened
to
the
tape
because
if
you
had
you
would
've
called
right
away
.
''
angãlil
dug
up
the
tape
and
called
the
family
back
the
same
day
to
set
up
a
meeting
with
celine
.
when
the
12-year-old
performed
in
his
office
in
montreal
angãlil
cried
and
set
in
motion
the
process
of
making
her
a
quãbãcois
and
later
an
international
star
.
he
mortgaged
his
house
to
pay
for
her
first
two
albums
producing
a
local
number
one
single
.
in
1983
she
became
the
first
canadian
to
have
a
gold
record
in
france
and
she
won
a
gold
medal
at
the
yamaha
songwriting
competition
in
japan
.
her
worldwide
reputation
was
in
the
making
but
success
in
the
united
states
was
not
yet
forthcoming
.
when
she
was
18
dion
saw
michael
jackson
performing
on
television
and
told
angãlil
that
she
wanted
to
be
a
star
like
him
.
angãlil
's
response
was
to
order
her
to
take
18
months
off
to
remake
her
image
.
dion
underwent
a
physical
transformation
cutting
her
hair
plucking
her
eyebrows
and
having
her
teeth
capped
to
cover
up
the
incisors
that
had
caused
a
quebec
humor
magazine
to
dub
her
``
canine
dion
.
''
she
was
also
sent
off
to
english
school
to
polish
the
language
that
would
help
her
to
break
into
the
american
market
.
when
she
emerged
from
this
process
she
had
made
an
amazing
transformation
from
teen
star
to
adult
chanteuse
.
the
payoff
came
almost
immediately
.
her
1990
breakthrough
album
unison
was
released
in
the
u.s.
by
epic
records
and
produced
several
hit
songs
but
it
was
her
duet
with
peabo
bryson
on
the
theme
song
of
disney
's
beauty
the
beast
that
was
her
true
breakthrough
.
``
beauty
the
beast
''
reached
number
one
on
the
pop
charts
and
won
both
a
grammy
and
academy
award
.
the
song
was
also
featured
on
her
second
english
album
1992
's
celine
dion
which
launched
another
top
ten
american
hit
with
``
if
you
asked
me
to
''
while
spawning
two
additional
top
40
singles
``
nothing
broken
but
my
heart
''
and
``
love
can
move
mountains
.
''
during
this
time
there
were
also
important
developments
in
dion
's
personal
life
.
in
1988
angãlil
crossed
the
line
from
manager
to
romantic
partner
when
he
kissed
dion
one
night
after
a
show
in
dublin
.
fearful
that
fans
would
find
the
26-year
difference
in
their
ages
unsettling
the
couple
kept
their
relationship
a
secret
for
several
years
.
but
their
1994
wedding
in
montreal
's
notre
dame
basilica
was
celebrated
not
only
by
the
250
invited
guests
but
by
millions
of
fans
worldwide.one
of
the
hardest-working
stars
in
show
business
dion
continued
to
record
and
perform
on
a
schedule
that
would
kill
most
people
.
she
recorded
six
albums
between
1992
and
1996
when
her
album
falling
into
you
took
her
to
a
new
level
of
stardom
.
the
recording
was
a
runaway
hit
winning
grammys
for
both
album
of
the
year
and
best
pop
album
.
another
honor
arrived
in
1996
she
was
asked
to
perform
at
the
opening
ceremonies
of
the
atlanta
olympics
.
dion
's
longest
tenure
on
the
pop
charts
would
come
the
following
year
however
when
she
recorded
``
my
heart
will
go
on
''
the
theme
song
for
james
cameron
's
blockbuster
movie
titanic
.
``
my
heart
will
go
on
''
became
omnipresent
on
the
radio
as
titanic
fever
swept
the
world
and
when
it
was
featured
on
her
album
let
's
talk
about
love
it
helped
propel
that
recording
to
the
top
of
the
charts
.
by
then
dion
had
the
power
to
gather
a
supporting
cast
of
stars
and
the
album
contained
an
amazing
collection
of
artists
including
barbra
streisand
luciano
pavarotti
and
the
bee
gees
.
the
album
would
win
a
host
of
awards
and
bring
dion
a
whole
new
world
of
fans.her
appearance
on
vh1
's
divas
live
special
with
aretha
franklin
gloria
estefan
mariah
carey
and
shania
twain
proved
popular
as
well
and
helped
solidify
dion
's
position
not
only
among
contemporary
female
pop
singers
but
historical
greats
like
franklin
.
the
continuing
popularity
of
her
recordings
and
live
performances
made
her
1999
sabbatical
seem
like
a
tragedy
to
her
fans
but
dion
needed
a
break
after
more
than
a
decade
and
a
half
at
a
breakneck
pace
.
in
1999
her
husband
angãlil
was
diagnosed
with
throat
cancer
.
while
the
disease
responded
well
to
treatment
and
went
into
remission
the
illness
was
a
wake-up
call
for
dion
who
decided
to
put
a
new
emphasis
on
her
family
life
and
announced
a
temporary
retirement
so
that
she
could
spend
more
time
at
home
and
have
a
child
.
after
undergoing
fertility
treatments
she
gave
birth
to
a
son
in
january
2001
.
the
collector
's
series
vol

was
released
during
dion
's
hiatus
it
featured
many
of
her
best-loved
songs
as
well
as
a
spanish-language
version
of
``
all
by
myself
.
``
dion
returned
to
the
public
eye
in
a
big
way
in
march
2002
with
a
new
day
has
come
.
the
album
debuted
at
number
one
in
over
17
countries
and
was
accompanied
by
a
full-scale
media
blitz
.
but
dion
's
greatest
challenge
was
yet
to
come
.
despite
millions
of
albums
sold
the
adoration
of
fans
worldwide
and
the
validation
of
her
peers
dion
's
success
was
still
hampered
by
image
problems
that
had
dogged
her
since
the
days
of
``
canine
dion
.
''
while
many
americans
adored
her
just
as
many
snickered
at
her
quãbãcois
heritage
and
the
relative
unorthodoxy
of
her
marriage
.
there
was
also
the
issue
of
her
relevancy
to
lucrative
audiences
existing
outside
of
her
pop
vocal
constituency
.
to
combat
these
issues
dion
and
her
management
made
a
series
of
bold
moves
that
attempted
to
solidify
her
career
and
ensure
its
continuity
as
she
entered
her
mid-thirties
.
in
early
2002
dion
announced
a
three-year
600-show
contract
to
appear
five
nights
a
week
in
an
entertainment
extravaganza
at
caesar
's
palace
las
vegas
called
a
new
day
.
the
production
would
take
place
in
a
custom-built
4000-seat
theater
and
would
feature
dion
as
the
centerpiece
of
a
multimedia
program
designed
and
orchestrated
by
franco
dragone
the
belgian
theater
impresario
behind
the
modern

with
the

of
