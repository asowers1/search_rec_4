the
strange
triumph
of
the
little
prince
by
adam
gopnik
of
all
the
books
written
in
french
over
the
past
century
antoine
de
saint-exupérys
le
petit
prince
is
surely
the
best
loved
in
the
most
tongues
.
this
is
very
strange
because
the
books
meaningsits
purpose
and
intent
and
moralstill
seem
far
from
transparent
even
seventy-five-plus
years
after
its
first
appearance
.
indeed
the
startling
thing
looking
again
at
the
first
reviews
of
the
book
is
that
far
from
being
welcomed
as
a
necessary
and
beautiful
parable
it
bewildered
and
puzzled
its
readers
.
among
the
early
reviewers
only
p.
l.
traverswho
had
with
a
symmetry
that
makes
the
nonbeliever
shiver
written
an
equivalent
myth
for
england
in
her
mary
poppins
booksreally
grasped
the
books
dimensions
or
its
importance
.
over
time
the
suffrage
of
readers
has
altered
that
conclusion
of
course
a
classic
is
a
classic
.
but
it
has
altered
the
conclusion
without
really
changing
the
point
.
this
year
marks
an
efflorescence
of
attention
including
a
full-scale
exhibition
of
saint-exupérys
original
artwork
at
the
morgan
library
museum
in
new
york
.
but
we
are
no
closer
to
penetrating
the
central
riddle
what
is
the
little
prince
about
everyone
knows
the
basic
bones
of
the
story
an
aviator
downed
in
the
desert
and
facing
long
odds
of
survival
encounters
a
strange
young
person
neither
man
nor
really
boy
who
it
emerges
over
time
has
travelled
from
his
solitary
home
on
a
distant
asteroid
where
he
lives
alone
with
a
single
rose
.
the
rose
has
made
him
so
miserable
that
in
torment
he
has
taken
advantage
of
a
flock
of
birds
to
convey
him
to
other
planets
.
he
is
instructed
by
a
wise
if
cautious
fox
and
by
a
sinister
angel
of
death
the
snake
.
it
took
many
yearsand
many
readingsfor
this
reader
to
begin
to
understand
that
the
book
is
a
war
story
.
not
an
allegory
of
war
rather
a
fable
of
it
in
which
the
central
emotions
of
conflictisolation
fear
and
uncertaintyare
alleviated
only
by
intimate
speech
and
love
.
but
the
petit
prince
is
a
war
story
in
a
very
literal
sense
tooeverything
about
its
making
has
to
do
not
just
with
the
onset
of
war
but
with
the
strange
defeat
of
france
with
the
experience
of
vichy
and
the
occupation
.
saint-exupérys
sense
of
shame
and
confusion
at
the
devasation
led
him
to
make
a
fable
of
abstract
ideas
set
against
specific
loves
.
in
this
enterprise
he
sang
in
unconscious
harmony
with
the
other
great
poets
of
the
wars
loss
from
j.
d.
salingerwhose
great
post-war
story
for
esméwith
love
and
squalor
shows
us
moral
breakdown
eased
only
by
the
speech
of
a
lucid
childto
his
contemporary
albert
camus
who
also
took
from
the
war
the
need
to
engage
in
a
perpetual
battle
between
each
mans
happiness
and
the
illness
of
abstraction
meaning
the
act
of
distancing
real
emotion
from
normal
life
.
we
know
the
circumstances
of
the
composition
of
the
little
prince
in
detail
now
courtesy
of
stacy
schiffs
fine
biography
saint-exupéry
.
escaped
from
europe
to
an
unhappy
monolingual
exile
in
north
america
engaged
in
petty
but
heated
internecine
warfare
with
the
other
exile
and
resisting
groups
he
had
a
poor
opinion
of
degaulle
who
he
wrongly
thought
was
setting
the
french
against
the
french
rather
than
against
the
germans
saint-exupéry
wrote
this
most
french
of
fables
in
manhattan
and
long
island
.
the
books
desert
setting
derives
from
the
aviator
saint-exupérys
1935
experience
of
having
been
lost
for
almost
a
week
in
the
arabian
desert
with
his
memories
of
loneliness
hallucination
impending
death
and
enveloping
beauty
in
the
desert
realized
on
the
page
.
the
central
love
story
of
the
prince
and
rose
derives
from
his
stormy
love
affair
with
his
wife
consuelo
from
whom
the
rose
takes
her
cough
and
her
flightiness
and
her
imperiousness
and
her
sudden
swoons
.
while
he
had
been
lost
in
the
desert
in
35
schiff
tells
us
she
had
been
publicly
mourning
his
loss
on
her
own
asteroid
her
table
at
the
brasserie
lipp
.
the
desert
and
the
rosehis
life
as
an
intrepid
aviator
and
his
life
as
a
baffled
loverwere
his
inspiration
.
but
between
those
two
experiences
skewering
them
dividing
them
with
a
line
was
the
war
.
in
the
deepest
parts
of
his
psyche
he
had
felt
the
loss
of
france
not
just
as
a
loss
of
battle
but
also
as
a
loss
of
meaning
.
the
desert
of
the
strange
defeat
was
more
bewildering
than
the
desert
of
libya
had
been
nothing
any
longer
made
sense
.
saint-exs
own
war
was
honorable
he
flew
with
the
gr
ii33
reconnaissance
squadron
of
the
armée
de
lair
.
and
after
the
bitter
defeat
he
fled
europe
like
so
many
other
patriotic
frenchmen
travelling
through
portugal
and
arriving
in
new
york
on
the
last
day
of
1940
.
but
as
anyone
who
lived
through
it
knew
what
made
the
loss
so
traumatic
was
the
sense
that
the
entire
underpinning
of
french
civilization
not
merely
its
armies
had
come
so
to
speak
under
the
scrutiny
of
the
gods
and
with
remarkable
speed
collapsed
.
searching
for
the
causes
of
that
collapse
the
most
honest
honorable
mindsmarc
bloch
and
camus
among
themthought
that
the
real
fault
lay
in
the
french
habit
of
abstraction
.
the
french
tradition
that
moved
and
still
moves
pragmatic
questions
about
specific
instances
into
a
parallel
paper
universe
in
which
the
general
theoretical
questionthe
modelis
what
matters
most
had
failed
its
makers
.
certainly
one
way
of
responding
to
the
disaster
was
to
search
out
some
new
set
of
abstractions
of
overarching
categories
to
replace
those
lost
.
but
a
more
humane
response
was
to
engage
in
a
ceaseless
battle
against
all
those
abstractions
that
keep
us
from
life
as
it
is
.
no
one
put
this
better
than
the
heroic
bloch
himself
the
first
task
of
my
trade
i.e
.
of
the
historian
but
more
broadly
the
humanist
properly
so
called
consists
in
avoiding
big-sounding
abstract
terms
.
those
who
teach
history
should
be
continually
concerned
with
the
task
of
seeking
the
solid
and
concrete
behind
the
empty
and
abstract
.
in
other
words
it
is
on
men
rather
than
functions
that
they
should
concentrate
all
their
attention
.
this
might
seem
like
a
very
odd
moral
to
take
from
the
experience
of
something
as
devastating
as
the
war
.
but
it
wasnt
merely
intellectual
an
amateurs
non-combatant
epiphany
.
at
a
purely
tactical
military
level
the
urge
to
abstraction
had
meant
the
urge
to
fetishize
fixed
systematic
solutions
at
the
expense
of
tactical
fluidity
and
resourcefulness
.
the
maginot
line
was
an
abstract
idea
that
had
been
allowed
to
replace
flexible
strategy
and
common
sense
.
one
recalls
picassos
comment
to
matisse
when
the
troubled
french
painter
asked
him
in
1940
but
what
about
our
generals
what
are
they
doing
our
generals
theyre
the
masters
at
the
ecole
des
beaux
arts
picasso
responded
meaning
men
possessed
by
the
same
rote
formulae
and
absence
of
observation
and
obsessive
traditionalism
as
the
academic
artists
.
from
an
experience
that
was
so
dehumanizing
and
overwhelmingan
experience
that
turns
an
entire
human
being
with
a
complicated
life
history
and
destiny
first
into
a
cipher
and
then
into
a
casualtysaint-exupéry
wanted
to
rescue
the
person
not
the
statistic
.
the
statistics
could
be
any
of
those
the
men
on
the
planets
are
obsessed
with
the
counting
fetish
that
might
take
in
stars
if
one
is
an
astronomer
or
profits
for
businessmen
.
the
richest
way
to
see
le
petit
prince
is
as
an
extended
parable
of
the
kinds
and
follies
of
abstractionand
the
special
intensity
and
poignance
of
the
story
is
that
saint-exupéry
dramatizes
the
struggle
against
abstraction
not
as
a
philosophical
subject
but
as
a
life-and-death
story
.
the
book
moves
from
asteroid
to
desert
from
fable
and
comedy
to
enigmatic
tragedy
in
order
to
make
one
recurrent
point
you
cant
love
roses
.
you
can
only
love
a
rose
.
for
all
of
the
princes
journey
is
a
journey
of
exile
like
saint-exupérys
away
from
generic
experience
towards
the
eroticism
of
the
particular
flower
.
to
be
responsible
for
his
rose
the
prince
learns
is
to
see
it
as
it
really
is
in
all
its
fragility
and
vanityindeed
in
all
its
utter
commonnesswithout
loving
it
less
for
being
so
fragile
.
the
persistent
triumph
of
specific
experience
can
be
found
in
something
as
idiosyncratic
and
bizarre
as
the
opening
image
of
a
boa
constrictor
swallowing
an
elephant
which
the
narrator
tells
us
the
grownups
can
only
see
as
a
generic
object
.
this
is
where
saint-ex
and
the
surrealists
who
admired
hima
tracing
of
his
hand
appears
in
one
of
the
issues
of
the
surrealist
journal
minotaurtouch
.
rene
magrittes
paintings
with
their
very
similar
obsession
with
middle-class
hats
suggest
that
every
time
you
see
a
bourgeois
derby
there
may
be
a
boa
constrictor
inside
.
the
x-ray
of
every
hat
reveals
a
boa
constrictor
in
every
head
.
that
could
be
the
motto
of
every
surrealist
exhibition
.
the
men
the
prince
meets
on
his
journey
to
earth
are
all
men
who
have
in
blochs
sense
been
reduced
to
functions
.
the
businessman
the
astronomer
even
the
poor
lamplighter
have
become
their
occupations
and
gone
blind
to
the
stars
.
it
is
again
the
essential
movement
we
find
in
camus
only
in
the
little
prince
it
is
shown
to
us
as
comic
fable
rather
than
realistic
novel
.
the
world
conspires
to
make
us
blind
to
its
own
workings
our
real
work
is
to
see
the
world
again
.
