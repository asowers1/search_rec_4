for

on

off
the

of
england
by
someone
named
u.n.

.
each
of
the
guest
bedrooms

contains
a

of
a
nursery
rhyme
``

each

dies
one

this
rhyme
turns
out
to
be
the
framework
for
u.n.
owen
's

it
soon
becomes
clear
that
all
of
the

``

were
duped
in
different

coming
to

that

characters

that

can
distinguish

as
the
book
progresses
and
readers
get
further
inside
their
minds
and
their
fears
the
suspense
builds
.
one
of
the
darkest
aspects
of
the
novel
is
the
fact
there
's
no
``
good
guy

here
--
all
of

appear
equally
guilty
in
more
ways
than
one
.
this
is
an
exciting

--
however
grisly

that
is
to
be
enjoyed
