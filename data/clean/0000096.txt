imagine
a
medieval
castle
run
by
the
benedictines
with
cellarers
herbalists
gardeners
librarians
young
novices
.
one
after
the
other
half
a
dozen
monks
are
found
murdered
in
the
most
bizarre
ways
.
a
learned
franciscan
who
is
sent
to
solve
the
mystery
finds
himself
involved
in
the
frightening
events
inside
the
abbey
.
imagine
also
that
toward
the
end
of
the
narrative
it
turns
out
that
all
those
horrible
crimes
were
committed
for
highly
ethical
and
cultural
reasons
.
just
fancy
that
the
manuscript
of
the
lost
second
part
of
the
''poetics
''
by
aristotle
-
the
lost
book
containing
his
theory
of
comedy
and
laughter
-
has
been
found
in
the
library
and
that
somebody
will
do
anything
to
stop
the
circulation
of
that
manuscript
.
at
this
point
all
you
have
to
know
is
that
umberto
eco
has
written
a
novel
-
his
first
-
and
that
it
has
become
a
literary
event
in
europe
.
on
the
best-seller
list
practically
everywhere
the
book
has
also
received
two
of
the
most
important
literary
awards
in
france
and
in
italy
the
prix
medici
and
the
premio
strega
.
now
this
excellent
translation
by
william
weaver
makes
''the
name
of
the
rose
''
available
in
english
.
translating
a
book
with
so
many
voices
and
levels
of
meaning
can
not
have
been
easy
.
text
mr.
eco
's
accomplishment
seems
to
have
the
sturdy
pace
of
inevitability
so
that
one
is
tempted
to
explore
the
reasons
for
the
celebrity
of
this
novel
even
before
commenting
on
it
.
the
answer
may
lie
in
the
fact
that
mr.
eco
is
the
unacknowledged
leader
of
contemporary
italian
culture
a
man
whose
academic
and
ideological
prestige
has
grown
steadily
through
years
of
dazzling
and
solid
work
.
in
international
forums
he
is
considered
the
most
important
representative
of
semiotics
that
elegant
pursuit
of
the
meaning
of
signs
in
language
and
elsewhere
since
the
death
of
roland
barthes
.
the
reader
who
is
curious
about
it
might
look
into
mr.
eco
's
''role
of
the
reader
''
recently
published
in
english
.
he
is
also
a
historian
a
scholarly
critic
of
the
works
of
james
joyce
and
a
distinguished
teacher
at
the
university
of
bologna
.
for
many
years
he
has
also
been
an
extremely
popular
columnist
for
the
magazine
l'espresso
.
using
both
intelligence
and
flexibility
he
has
become
the
spokesman
of
a
philosophical
trend
that
could
be
labeled
as
a
kind
of
''neo-enlightenment
.
''
his
approach
entails
methodological
doubting
versus
dogmatism
and
the
use
of
parody
and
irony
against
sectarian
thought
his
idea
of
culture
is
that
it
is
mainly
a
channel
of
interdisciplinary
exchange
rather
than
a
provider
of
certainties
or
a
chapel
for
hermetic
and
initiatory
rites
.
but
that
description
is
already
a
beginning
of
an
interpretation
of
mr.
eco
's
novel
.
''the
name
of
the
rose
''
takes
place
in
the
14th
century
.
in
some
of
his
essays
mr.
eco
has
linked
that
century
with
our
age
with
all
of
its
certainties
weakened
under
the
combined
blows
of
new
sciences
and
contradictory
social
events
.
aptly
enough
the
novel
is
a
mystery
the
most
rationalist
of
all
literary
genres
based
on
a
determination
to
reach
irrefutable
if
partial
truth
who
is
the
assassin
and
what
are
his
motives
and
what
signs
will
help
to
unravel
the
mystery
in
the
novel
william
of
baskerville
the
protagonist
has
been
called
to
investigate
a
crime
in
a
benedictine
abbey
.
like
sherlock
holmes
william
comes
from
england
-
not
from
scotland
yard
however
but
from
the
philosophical
school
of
roger
bacon
and
william
of
occam
the
founders
of
cognitive
empiricism
a
philosophy
based
on
the
exact
examination
of
real
evidence
revealed
by
the
senses
and
thus
a
perfect
tool
for
unraveling
a
mystery
.
it
is
to
these
men
that
our
learned
and
ironic
monk-detective
constantly
refers
.
the
story
is
narrated
by
adso
a
novice
who
is
young
and
whose
admiration
of
william
is
naive
.
an
intellectual
and
emotional
bond
develops
between
the
two
a
bond
similar
to
that
between
leverkun
and
the
good
serenus
who
narrates
his
story
in
thomas
mann
's
''doktor
faustus
.
''
adso
speaks
in
the
name
of
a
faith
that
william
has
probably
lost
.
the
old
biblical
problem
about
whether
the
first
sin
was
a
forbidden
pursuit
of
knowledge
or
a
sin
of
disobedience
finds
no
answer
.
does
the
passion
for
knowledge
derive
from
loss
of
faith
or
in
today
's
terms
does
semiotics
derive
from
loss
of
certainty
in
unshakable
truth
the
assassin
himself
gives
us
an
answer
when
he
finally
confesses
the
reasons
for
his
crimes
.
his
motivations
deal
with
a
poetic
and
philosophic
problem
that
i
can
not
reveal
without
being
unfair
to
the
reader
.
it
is
enough
to
say
that
wild
theological
discussions
develop
between
william
of
baskerville
and
the
murderer
.
after
the
discovery
of
the
culprit
the
novel
explodes
with
pyrotechnic
inventions
literally
as
well
as
figuratively
.
hold
on
till
the
end
.
the
narrative
impulse
that
commands
the
story
is
irresistible
.
that
is
no
mean
feat
for
a
book
in
which
many
pages
describe
ecclesiastical
councils
or
theological
debates
and
many
others
analyze
in
detail
the
positions
of
european
powers
regarding
the
reform
of
the
franciscan
order
.
there
are
also
frequent
quotations
in
classic
and
medieval
latin
.
yet
mr.
eco
's
delight
in
his
narrative
does
not
fail
to
touch
the
reader
who
may
or
may
not
choose
to
be
intrigued
with
the
levels
of
interpretation
crisscrossing
in
front
of
him
as
in
a
semiotic
labyrinth
.
after
all
for
a
semiologist
like
mr.
eco
a
sleuth
's
pursuit
of
the
truth
behind
a
murder
mystery
involves
also
the
pursuit
of
meaning
-
in
words
symbols
ideas
every
conceivable
sign
the
visible
universe
contains
.
i
shall
point
out
just
one
hidden
path
as
an
example
.
it
is
certainly
possible
to
read
''the
name
of
the
rose
''
as
a
novel
in
which
every
character
and
event
find
an
equivalent
in
today
's
world
.
in
many
ways
this
is
a
roman
a
clef
.
those
pages
dedicated
to
heretical
movements
in
the
middle
ages
-
two
stories
in
the
novel
are
about
brother
dolcino
and
brother
michael
heretics
burned
alive
along
with
their
followers
by
the
inquisition
-have
clear
references
to
contemporary
attempts
at
revolution
in
different
countries
and
the
harsh
repression
of
those
efforts
.
in
addition
the
trial
of
the
cellarer
in
this
novel
reveals
analogies
with
stalin
's
purges
savage
self-accusations
brainwashing
and
all
.
different
levels
of
meaning
pervade
the
microcosm
of
the
book
.
in
new
york
two
months
ago
i
met
a
friend
of
mr.
eco
a
scholar
who
not
having
published
any
books
can
not
find
an
academic
appointment
.
i
am
sure
i
recognize
in
him
the
model
of
a
minor
character
of
this
novel
-
''a
most
voracious
reader
he
knew
by
heart
all
the
books
in
the
library
but
he
had
a
strange
infirmity
he
was
unable
to
write
.
they
called
him
abbas
agraphicus
.
''
many
similar
games
are
there
for
the
reader
to
discover
.
he
may
decide
not
to
play
any
of
the
games
but
to
be
carried
along
instead
by
the
elan
of
the
narration
.
he
will
have
to
make
a
choice
between
adso
and
william
.
it
is
almost
too
obvious
that
william
is
mr.
eco
himself
.
but
he
is
eco
the
philosopher
and
essayist
while
the
eco
who
writes
''the
name
of
the
rose
''
is
adso
a
voice
young
and
old
at
the
same
time
speaking
from
nostalgia
for
love
and
passion
.
william
shapes
the
story
with
his
insight
adso
gives
it
his
own
pathos
.
he
will
never
think
as
william
does
that
''books
are
not
made
to
be
believed
but
to
be
subjected
to
inquiry
''
adso
writes
to
be
believed
.
i
for
one
go
along
with
adso
.
after
all
even
if
it
is
william
who
solves
the
