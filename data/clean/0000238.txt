audiences
may
have
moved
on
to
another
spider-man
franchise
in
the
amazing
spider-man
but
sam
raimi
is
still
stuck
in
the
original
webslinger
movie
universe
.
raimi
recently
looked
back
not
so
fondly
at
2007s
conclusion
to
his
spider-man
trilogy
during
an
interview
with
the
nerdist
.
the
filmmaker
said
trying
to
raise
the
bar
by
adding
characters
he
didnt
believe
in
may
have
doomed
the
film
.
itâs
a
movie
that
just
didnât
work
very
well
he
told
chris
hardwick
on
the
nerdist
podcast
.
i
tried
to
make
it
work
but
i
didnât
really
believe
in
all
the
characters
so
that
couldnât
be
hidden
from
people
who
loved
spider-man
.
if
the
director
doesnât
love
something
itâs
wrong
of
them
to
make
it
when
so
many
other
people
love
it
.
i
think
raising
the
stakes
after
spider-man
2
was
the
thinking
going
into
it
and
i
think
thatâs
what
doomed
us
.
i
shouldâve
just
stuck
with
the
characters
and
the
relationships
and
progressed
them
to
the
next
step
and
not
tried
to
top
the
bar
.
when
hardwick
insisted
during
the
interview
that
bad
isnt
the
right
word
to
describe
spider-man
3
raimi
said
awful
is
the
better
choice
.
raimi
has
said
in
the
past
that
he
wasnt
the
biggest
fan
of
the
villain
venom
whom
sony
wanted
to
include
because
of
the
characters
large
youth
following
.
the
studio
has
since
ordered
a
spinoff
focusing
on
venom
as
part
of
the
amazing
spider-man
rebooted
series
.

a
bit
hard
on
himself
.
i
cant
really
tell
any
difference
between
the
three
movies
.
they
were
all
pretty
reasonable
.
and
didnt
no

make
buckets

money
.
is
that
not
the

project
.
nobody
is

your
opinion
on
this
film
clashes
with
that
of
the
majority
.
the
film
was
a
trainwreck
compared
with
th
first
two
or
not
.
ive
gone
and
watched
all
5
of
the
spiderman
films
over
the
last
few
days
.
no
doubt
raimis
films
have
a
significantly
greater
amount
of
cheese
and
silliness
to
them
even
more
apparent
since
the
release
of
marc
webbs
films
.
however
while
part
1
was
something
fresh
and
new
part
2
raised
the
bar
in
several
levels
and
was
more
highly
regarded
.
part
3it
made
a
mockery
of
itself
across
the
board
and
destroyed
almost
every
bit
of
source
material
it
borrowed
from
.
even
the
effects
took
a
downhill
turn
.

that
dance
sequence
featuring
tobey
maguire
was
traumatic
to
watch
.
turned
me
off
completely
to
any
other
projects
by
the
director
and
actor
.
they
should
have
known
better
than
to
include
it
in
the
movie
.

hes
being
tactful
and
gracious
here
.
we
all
know
it
was
avi
arad
and
the
sony
morons
who
insisted
on
venom
and
raimi
isnt
calling
them
out
on
it
because
he
could
possibly
be
invited
back
to
save
the
new
franchise
.
but
that
wont
happen
if
he
goes
around
calling
them
fools
.

most
movie
serials
lose
their
steam
after
the
first
sequel
its
hard
to
stay
inventive
while
keeping
true
to
the
characters
.
however
sam
raimi
should
concentrate
on
new
projects
instead
of
bagging
on
spider-man

apologizing
for

i
think
its
very
productive
and
i
appreciate
a
filmmaker
stepping
up
and
admitting
they
did
a
poor
job

almost
everything
about
this
film
was
wrong
.
the
casting
and
character
changes
of
introducing
gwen
stacy
.
the
bad
design
for
the
black
suit
.
the
alteration
in
what
the
alien
symbiotic
did
to
peters
behavior
and
how
it
was
manifested
on
screen
.
the
casting
and
character
changes
of
introducing
eddie
brock
.
the
rushed
storyline
of
trying
to
create
an
entire
alien
suitvenom
tale
in
one
movie
.
the
further
bastardization
of
the
new
goblin
.
too
many
villains
in
one
story
.
