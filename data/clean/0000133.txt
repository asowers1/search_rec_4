every

while
the
conversation
will
turn
to
``
favorite
movies
.
''
i
'll
mention
titanic
and
at
least
a
couple
people
will
snicker
.
i
pay
them
no
mind
because
i
know
that
five
years
ago
these
same
people
were
moved
to
tears
by
that
very
movie
.
and
they
're
too
embarrassed
now
to
admit
it.i
just
rewatched
titanic
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
time
.
expecting
to
simply
enjoy
the
story
again
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
movie
has
lost
none
of
its
power
over
these
five
years
.
i
cried
again
...
.
in
all
the
same
places
.
it
brought
me
back
to
1997
when
i
can
remember
how
a
movie
that
no
one
thought
would
break
even
became
the
most
popular
movie
of
all
time
.
a
movie
that
burst
into
the
public
consciousness
like
no
other
movie
i
can
recall
yes
even
more
than
star
wars
.
and
today
many
people
wo
n't
even
admit
they
enjoyed
it
.
folks
let
's
get
something
straight
--
you
do
n't
look
cool
when
you
badmouth
this
film
.
you
look
like
an
out
of
touch
cynic.no
movie
is
perfect
and
this
one
has
a
few
faults
.
some
of
the
dialogue
falls
flat
and
some
of
the
plot
surrounding
the
two
lovers
comes
together
a
little
too
neatly
.
however
none
of
this
is
so
distracting
that
it
ruins
the
film.leonardo
dicaprio
and
kate
winslet
are
wonderful
.
leo
is
one
of
the
fine
actors
of
his
generation
.
wait
'til
you
see
him
in
gangs
of
new
york
before
you
call
him
nothing
more
than
a
pretty
boy
.
kate
winslet
was
so
strong
in
this
film
.
the
movie
really
was
hers
and
she
held
it
together
beautifully.james
cameron
managed
what
many
believed
was
impossible
by
recreating
a
completely
believable
titanic
.
the
sinking
scenes
were
horrific
just
as
they
were
that
night
.
how
anyone
can
say
the
effects
were
bad
is
beyond
me
.
i
was
utterly
transfixed.this
film
is
one
memorable
scene
after
another
.
titanic
leaving
port
in
southampton
.
rose
and
jack
at
the
bow
``
flying
''
.
``
iceberg
right
ahead
''
the
screws
hanging
unbelievably
out
of
the
ocean
.
the
screams
of
the
doomed
after
she
went
down
.
and
that
ending
that
brought
even
the
burliest
man
in
the
theater
to
tears.the
music
which
has
also
been
a
victim
of
the
film
's
success
was
a
key
ingredient
.
james
horner
's
score
was
simply
perfect
.
and
the
love
theme
was
beautiful
and
tragic
.
too
bad
celine
dion
's
pop
song
version
had
to
destroy
this
great
bit
of
music
for
so
many.i
confess
i
am
a
titanic
buff
.
as
such
i
relished
the
opportunity
to
see
the
ship
as
we
never
got
to
see
it
--
in
all
its
beauty
.
perhaps
watching
it
sink
affected
me
more
than
some
because
i
've
had
such
an
interest
in
the
ship
all
my
life
.
however
i
doubt
many
of
those
i
saw
crying
were
titanic
buffs
.
i
applaud
cameron
for
bringing
this
story
to
the
masses
in
a
way
that
never
demeaned
the
tragedy
.
the
film
was
made
with
such
humanity.another
reviewer
said
it
better
than
i
ever
could
open
up
your
hearts
to
titanic
and
you
will
not
be
disappointed
.
