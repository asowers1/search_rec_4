if
i
were
to
pick
one
band
to
consider
my
favorite
iâd
have
to
go
with
pink
floyd
.
i
have
always
loved
their
music
and
particularly
their
lyrics
.
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
see
them
play
live
in
the
1990s
and
i
saw
roger
waters
perform
the
wall
live
and
that
ranks
as
the
greatest
concert
iâve
ever
seen
.
inspired
by
iron
mike
gallego
and
his
incredibly
spot-on
and
outstanding
piece
on
ranking
beastie
boys
songs
i
present
to
you
the
26
greatest
pink
floyd
songs
.
i
really
really
recommend
giving
these
a
listen
.
i
originally
liked
floyd
for
the
music
but
as
i
grew
older
i
began
to
appreciate
the
intricacies
of
the
lyrics
.
when
the
music
and
the
lyrics
were
on
the
money
it
couldnât
be
beat
.
there
are
certain
stereotypes
when
someone
identifies
himself
as
a
floyd
fan
two
of
which
are
stoner
and
prog-rock
fan
.
i
am
neither
.
i
am
a
fan
of
writing
and
music
a
fan
of
intelligence
which
is
odd
since
i
am
also
a
fan
of
dick
and
fart
jokes
and
iâm
a
fan
of
concepts
.
so
i
give
you
the

26

saucerful
of
secrets
this
roger
waters
piece
was
a
staple
of
pink
floyd
concerts
from
the
late
60s
into
around
1973
.
as
a
very
curious
bit
of
trivia
itâs
the
only
song
in
their
catalog
which
features
both
dave
gilmour
and
syd
barrett
on
guitar
.
however
itâs
a
mainly
rhythm-section
and
keyboard
dominated
song
so
you
canât
really
discern
the
guitar
parts
all
that
well
.

perform
this
song

-
saucerful
of
secrets
i
included
this
syd
barrett
song
because
it
is
a
musical
manifestation
of
mental
psychosis
.
some
say
barrett
suffered
from
schizophrenia
and
if
so
then
this
song
is
a
fairly
accurate
representation
.
itâs
disjointed
and
sad
yet
harrowing
.
itâs
the
musical
equivalent
of
a
cautionary
tale

this
is
the
first
real
effort
by
pink
floyd
to
shake
the
astral
boundaries
theyâd
set
or
had
others
set
for
themselves
and
move
towards
cohesive
and
uniform
pieces
of
music
.
itâs
almost
purely
instrumental
save
for
the
lyric
âsilence
in
the
studioâ
at
almost
24
minutes
long
itâs
a
lot
to
listen
to
.
i
also
chose
this
song
because
i
have
two
specific
personal
anecdotes
.
first
i
used
to
have
a
radio
program
in
college
the
much
coveted
100am
-
400am
sunday
night
slot
.
i
used
to
put
this
song
on
so
i
could
go
out
grab
a
smoke
eat
a
quick
bite
grab
another
smoke
and
come
back
in
with
time
to
spare
.
a
second
anecdote
i
have
is
that
my
old
roommate
used
to
thank
me
for
this
as
each
time
iâd
get
high
and
play
it
in
our
apartment
heâd
bang
his
girlfriend
.
turns
out
it
was
their
sex
soundtrack

the
final
cut
a
strong
song
off
of
what
is
generally
considered
a
roger
waters
solo
album
.
the
entire
album
is
in
my
estimation
greatly
underrated
.
while
itâs
dominated
by
waters
the
painful
honesty
of
the
lyrics
is
what
sets
this
album
and
song
apart
.
this
song

others
from

learning

-
a
momentary
lapse
of
reason
i
included
this
song
simply
because
it
reaffirmed
that
the

was
still
a
relevant
band
even
without
roger
waters
.
released
in

this
single
launched

the
song
like
the
album
focused
more
on
music

melody
and
less
on
lyrical
and
thematic
content

interstellar
overdrive-
the
piper
at
the
gates
of
dawn
most
people
would
pick
astronomy
domine
as
a
classic
early
floyd
song
but
i
think
interstellar
overdrive
is
more
representative
of
what
they
were
all
about
.
this
is
a
guitar-heavy
track
which
still
calls
to
the
cosmos
which
is
what
floyd
was
going
for
in
those
days
.
it
demonstrates
the
musical
ear
of
syd
barrett
quite
nicely
and
has
a
fantastic
driving
rhythm
.
20
.
one
of
these
days
-

the
only
lyric
is
âone

nobody
home
-
the
wall
this
is
the
first
of
six
songs
iâve
included
from
the
wall
.
i
chose
this
because
to
me
it
represents
the
loneliness
and
solitude
we
all
feel
sometime
after
our
late
30s
.
i
understood
dark
side
of
the
moon
when
i
was
25
.
i
understood
the
wall
only
after
i
hit
my
30s
.
regardless
of
how
social
we
may
be
in
our
younger
years
we
tend
to
regress
as
we
age
.
this
song
is
about
wanting
to
reach
out
even
a
little
knowing
that
while
we
may
have
what
we
think
we
want
in
a
materialistic
fashion
weâre
essentially
alone
.
itâs
fine
to
remove
yourself
from
society
but
donât
do
it
so
much
that
when
you
want
to
re-enter
youâve
got
nobody
there
to
help
.

lucifer
sam
-
the
piper
at
the
gates
of
dawn
i
think
that
had
syd
barrett
not
gone
insane
this
is
the
direction
pink
floyd
wouldâve
taken
.
they
would
be
more
along
the
lines
of
the
beatles
or
the
stones
insofar
as
they
wouldâve
represented
a
certain
era
of
sound
.
this
is
pure

atom
heart
mother
the
first
soul-bearing
song
by
roger
waters
.
there
are
times
when
i
think
that
this
song
says
more
by
way
of
its
honest
simplicity
than
all
his
other
shout-from-the-rooftops
rhetorics
could
ever
achieve
.
itâs
a
wonderful
song
bemoaning
the
growing
distance
between
people
.
16.sheep
-
animals
one
of
only
five
songs
from
the
album
this
song
bemoans
the
lives
of
people
who
blindly
follow
others
or
allow
themselves
to
be
led
around
by
the
nose
.
the
album
was
released
when
punk
was
in
vogue
but
it
wasnât
an
intentional
representation
of
the
musical
climate
.
any
floyd
fan
knows
they
didnât
even
really
know
what
the
musical
landscape
was
anytime
after
dark
side
.
itâs
a
hard
charging
album
and
this
song
deserves
a
spot
on
the
list
if
only
for
the
really
really
cool
effect
of
vocals
seamlessly
changing
into
notes
from
a
keyboard
.

what
shall
we
do
now
-
the
wall
film
version
this
song
takes
the
place
of
empty
spaces
from
the
original
album
.
i
chose
this
cinematic
replacement
because
i
think
it
segues
better
into
young
lust
.
lyrically
it
just
uses
short
choppy
lines
of
verse
but
it
moves
quickly
and
purposefully
and
reinforces
the
mood
of
that
particular
place
in
the
film
and
on
the
album
.
while
not
available
on
the

it
can
be
found

this
song
set
the
stage
for
the
cold

distant
album
that
was
wish
you
were
here
.
many
people
feel
that
this
is
the
quintessential
pink
floyd
album
.
i
disagree
but
i
do
think
itâs
their
most
complete
album
.
this
song
engages
the
listener
in
a
very
personal
way
bringing
them
into
the
fold
and
allowing
them
to
share
the
feelings
of
loss
and
regret
that
the
members
feel
towards
syd
barrett
.
there
is
also
a
feeling
of
guilt
to
the
song
caused
the
way
the
band
decided
to
kick
syd
out
.
on
the
way
to
a
gig
the
band
just
one
day
opted
not
to
pick
barrett
up
.
his
increasing
instability
his
manic
ranting
and
raving
and
his
lost
grip
on
sanity
all
led
to
the
band
not
being
able
to
work
with
him
anymore
.
this
song
is
an
olive
branch
.
musically
as
well
rick
wrightâs
keyboards
dominate
the
album
and
that
is
evident
from
this
song
forward
.
the
overwhelming
presence
of
clinical
almost
sterile
keyboards
help
to
set
the
mood
of
the
entire
disc
.
11
.
one
of
my
turns
-
the
wall
where
to
begin
with
this
one
itâs
a
song
that
represents
the
tipping
point
of
madness
where
everything
finally
bubbles
to
a
head
.
lyrically
this
song
is
the
last
straw
for
a
very
unstable
persona
.
when
the
narrator
finally
has
it
with
his
unfaithful
wife
when
heâs
had
it
with
his
own
infidelity
when
heâs
had
it
with
the
pressures
of
his
own
life
created
by
him
he
explodes
with
a
fury
and
lays
waste
to
a
hotel
room
.
the
last
line
represents
his
fragile
state
of
mind
best
when
he
asks
âwhy
are
you
running
awayâ
after
doing
everything
he
can
to
drive
a
wedge
between
himself
and
society
at
large
.
10
.
us
and
them
-
dark
side
of
the
moon
my
impression
of
this
song
is
that
nobody
is
really
in
control
of
what
goes
on
except
for
the
political
powers
that
be
.
itâs
a
direct
condemnation
of
a
global
war
machine
constantly
sending
individuals
to
die
in
wars
while
they
sit
back
and
simply
plan
out
maneuvers
.
the
album
as
a
whole
concentrates
on
the
pressures
of
young
adulthood
and
the
feelings
of
helplessness
that
people
have
before
realizing
they
will
never
be
in
control
of
their
own
destiny
.

while
itâs

the
self
examination

the
persona

this

itâs
not

instead
roger

taking
inventory
of
where
he
is
in

what
heâs

another
in

also
the
feeling

of
touring
and
studio
time
that

feels
has
eroded
his

regardless

this
song
sums
up
loss

the
distance

imply
a

.
we
all
long
for
the
approval
of
our
parents
we
all
want
to
do
right
by
them
and
in
their
eyes
no
matter
how
old
we
get
.
this
song
is
about
seeking
the
blessing
from
those
whom
we
value
most
and
shape
us
the
most
permanently

when
the
tigers
broke
free
-
the
final
cut
originally
heard
in
the
film
version
of
the
wall
a
stark
harrowing
song
first
heard
in
the
film
the
wall
.
this
is
a
raw
open
examination
of
why
roger
waters
and
so
many
others
lost
their
fathers
in
world
war
two
and
the
cold
âthanksâ
from
the
government
for
their
service
.
its
subtle
vitriol
is
represented
in
the
lyrics
and
kind
old
king
george
sent
mother
a
note
when
he
heard
that
father
was
gone
.
it
was
i
recall
in
the
form
of
a
scroll
with
gold
leaf
and
all
.
and
i
found
it
one
day
in
a
drawer
of
old
photographs
hidden
away
.
and
my
eyes
still
grow
damp
to
remember
his
majesty
signed
with
his
own
rubber
stamp
.
the
song
was
re-released
on
a
version
of
the
final
cut
in
2004
and
it
fits
much
better
with
that
album
than
in
the
aforementioned
film
.
while
the
film
version
does
it
justice
it
just
dovetails
nicely
in
album
form
.

time
-
dark
side
of
the
moon
this
song
is
the
manifestation
of
when
you
realize
youâre
not
going
to
stay
young
forever
.
itâs
the
stark
realization
that
life
has
already
taken
hold
that
one
day
you
wake
up
and
realize
that
for
better
or
worse
youâre
an
adult
.
and
thereâs
nothing
you
can
do
about
it
.
the
clock
ticks
for
all
of
us
and
time
makes
that
point
perfectly
.
the
last
two
verses
sum
it
up
best
so
you
run
and
you
run
to
catch
up
with
the
sun
but
it
's
sinking
racing
around
to
come
up
behind
you
again
.
the
sun
is
the
same
in
a
relative
way
but
you
're
older
shorter
of
breath
and
one
day
closer
to
death
.
every
year
is
getting
shorter
never
seem
to
find
the
time
.
plans
that
either
come
to
naught
or
half
a
page
of
scribbled
lines
hanging
on
in
quiet
desperation
is
the
english
way
the
time
is
gone
the
song
is
over
thought
i
'd
something
more
to
say
.

.
comfortably
numb
-
the
wall
it
had
to
be
number
one
.
itâs
the
most
complete
pink
floyd
song
in
their
catalog
.
the
music
written
by
david
gilmour
blends
perfectly
with
the
lyrics
written
by
roger
waters
.
the
song
is
based
in
reality
as
waters
needed
a
doctorâs
shot
in
order
to
get
him
through
a
show
in
philadelphia
in
1977
.
with
waters
handling
the
verses
and
gilmour
handling
the
chorus
this
song
finds
the
perfect
medium
.
while
it
may
seem
like
a
cop-out
to
consider
this
number
one
i
dare
anyone
to
find
a
more
fitting
and
representative
song
that
captures
the
essence
of
the
band
.
add
to
that
not
one
but
two
blistering
guitar
solos
by
gilmour
and
youâve
got
a
recipe
for
success
.
this
is
the
song
that
most
casual
even
indifferent
floyd
fans
know
yet
it
means
just
as
much
to
those
who
revere
the
entire
catalog
of
music
.
comfortably
numb
holds
a
place
in
the
pantheon
of
great
rock
and
roll
songs
since
the
creation
of
the
genre
.
itâs
everything
a
song
should
be
.
my
belief
is
that
the
greatness
of
the
song
for
people
in
their
30s
or
older
can
be
found
in
this
excerpt
when
i
was
a
child
i
caught
a
fleeting
glimpse
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
.
i
turned
to
look
but
it
was
gone
i
can
not
put
my
finger
on
it
now
the
child
is
grown
the
dream
is
gone
.
i
have
become
comfortably
numb
if
you
havenât
listened
to
it
in
a
while
turn
it
on
mute
out
every
other
ambient
noise
and
just
absorb
it
sonically
.
it
works
on
so
many
levels
.
