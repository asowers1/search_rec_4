summary
eight
strangers
are
lured
to
the
mysterious
indian
island
.
some
of
them
believes
that
they
've
been
invited
by
an
old
friend
-
one
that
they
ca
n't
contact
to
confirm
the
invitation
.
the
rest
have
been
hired
by
a
mysterious
employer
.
once
they
arrive
at
the
island
they
meet
the
last
two
'guests
'
the
husband
and
wife
butler-cook
team
.
in
each
of
their
rooms
is
a
poem
entitled
'ten
little
indians
'
which
tells
the
story
of
ten
indian
boys
who
die
in
unusual
fashions
.
a
conversation
between
two
of
the
guests
leads
them
to
realize
that
none
of
them
know
their
host
-
the
mysterious
u.
n.
owen
.
at
dinner
they
notice
ten
indian
figurines
on
the
table
matching
the
poem
.
after
their
first
dinner
once
they
're
all
in
the
drawing-room
a
voice
reads
out
a
list
of
accusations
against
them
-
each
one
of
them
is
accused
of
murdering
at
least
one
person
and
they
have
been
brought
to
the
island
to
pay
for
their
crimes
.
no
one
is
sure
what
to
make
of
the
recording
until
marston
takes
a
drink
-
and
dies
of
cyanide
poisoning
.
just
as
the
poem
predicted
.
everyone
goes
to
bed
uneasy
some
feeling
guilty
about
the
crimes
they
've
committed
others
just
worried
about
their
safety
.
in
the
morning
they
discover
that
the
cook
has
died
in
the
night
as
well
although
it
may
have
been
natural
causes
...
the
boat
that
is
supposed
to
bring
supplies
is
very
late
and
soon
they
realize
that
no
one
is
coming
to
take
them
off
the
island
.
they
notice
as
well
that
every
time
someone
dies
one
of
the
ten
ceramic
figurines
disappear
.
as
everyone
begins
to
suspect
one
another
three
of
the
men
decide
to
search
the
island
to
make
sure
that
no
one
else
is
hiding
on
it
.
after
an
exhaustive
search
they
discover
that
there
are
definitely
only
eight
people
on
the
island
.
for
a
moment
they
believe
that
the
deaths
are
just
a
horrible
coincidence
-
until
someone
turns
up
with
their
head
smashed
in
.
since
there
is
no
one
else
on
the
island
that
means
that
the
killer
can
only
be
one
of
them
.
the
judge
leads
everyone
to
suspect
each
other
making
sure
that
everyone
understands
that
no
one
can
be
trusted
.
everyone
goes
to
sleep
scared
some
of
them
slowly
being
driven
mad
by
their
guilt
.
the
next
morning
rogers
the
butler
has
disappeared
.
they
quickly
find
his
body
-
he
's
been
murdered
with
an
axe
.
everyone
starts
getting
paranoid
.
emily
the
old
woman
begins
acting
strange
and
everyone
leaves
her
alone
for
a
little
while
-
when
they
return
she
's
been
murdered
leaving
only
five
people
left
.
wargrave
the
judge
suggests
that
they
lock
up
all
their
possible
weapons
including
the
revolver
that
lombard
brought
.
the
revolver
has
been
stolen
though
.
they
tear
the
house
apart
looking
for
it
but
they
ca
n't
find
it
.
everyone
decides
to
just
sit
around
with
only
one
leaving
at
any
one
time
-
theoretically
they
should
all
be
safe
that
way
.
vera
the
one
most
wracked
by
guilt
goes
up
to
her
room
and
is
frightened
by
a
strand
of
seaweed
that
represents
the
boy
she
murdered
by
drowning
.
everyone
goes
to
check
on
her
and
when
they
return
to
the
drawing
room
they
discover
that
the
judge
has
been
murdered
-
but
they
ca
n't
figure
out
who
had
the
chance
to
do
it
.
that
night
the
ex-policeman
blore
hears
someone
sneaking
out
.
he
searches
the
remaining
rooms
and
discover
that
armstrong
the
doctor
is
missing
-
so
he
must
be
the
killer
.
the
next
day
lombard
blore
and
vera
the
three
remaining
guests
walk
around
the
island
trying
to
signal
the
mainland
with
a
mirror
.
blore
goes
back
to
the
hoe
for
lunch
but
is
crushed
by
a
falling
slab
of
marble
.
lombard
and
vera
are
sure
armstrong
is
the
murderer
-
until
they
find
his
body
washed
up
against
some
rocks
.
even
though
evidence
has
shown
that
neither
of
them
could
be
the
killer
lombard
and
vera
do
n't
trust
each
other
.
vera
steals
lombard
's
gun
and
shoots
him
.
happy
to
finally
be
safe
and
alone
and
more
than
a
little
crazy
vera
walks
back
to
the
house
and
finds
that
someone
has
set
up
a
noose
in
her
room
.
finally
giving
into
her
guilt
she
hangs
herself
.
the
police
find
the
island
a
few
days
later
and
are
puzzled
by
the
mystery
-
they
ca
n't
figure
out
who
killed
everyone
since
there
are
only
bodies
on
the
island
and
no
one
could
have
escaped
it
.
a
few
weeks
later
a
bottle
is
caught
a
fisherman
.
inside
it
is
a
confession
written
by
wargrave
-
it
explains
and
why
he
killed
everyone
.
his
whole
life
he
had
twin
conflicting
desires
-
one
for
justice
the
other
to
kill
people
.
he
'd
enjoyed
killing
the
guilty
by
sentencing
them
to
death
in
his
court
but
that
was
n't
good
enough
.
he
wanted
to
kill
people
himself
.
once
he
found
that
he
was
dying
of
cancer
he
decided
to
go
through
with
it
.
he
found
nine
guilty
people
and
lured
them
to
the
island
then
murdered
them
one
by
one
using
armstrong
to
help
fake
his
death
so
that
he
would
n't
be
a
suspect
.
once
everyone
was
dead
he
arranged
to
kill
himself
so
that
it
would
look
like
his
fake
death
-
so
the
police
would
be
confused
by
an
unsolvable
crime
.
lastly
he
sealed
up
his
confession
in
a
bottle
and
threw
it
out
to
sea
because
he
could
n't
bear
the
thought
of
no
one
ever
knowing
about
how
brilliant
he
was
.
