is
a
skilled
thief
the
absolute
best
in
the
dangerous
art
of
extraction
stealing
valuable
secrets
from
deep
within
the
subconscious
during
the
dream
state
when
the
mind
is
at
its
most
vulnerable
.
cobb
's
rare
ability
has
made
him
a
coveted
player
in
this
treacherous
new
world
of
corporate
espionage
but
it
has
also
made
him
an
international
fugitive
and
cost
him
everything
he
has
ever
loved
.
now
cobb
is
being
offered
a
chance
at
redemption
.
one
last
job
could

can
accomplish
the
impossible-inception
.
instead
of
the
perfect
heist
cobb
and
his
team
of
specialists
have
to
pull
off
the
reverse
their
task
is
not
to
steal
an
idea
but
to
plant
one
.
if
they
succeed
it
could
be
the
perfect
crime
.
but
no
amount
of
careful
planning
or
expertise
can
prepare
the
team
for
the
dangerous
enemy
that
seems
to
predict
their
every
move

nolan
has
created
something
with
his
unbelievably
incredibly
and
god-
gifted
mind
which
will
blow
the
minds
of
the
audience
away
.
the

premiere
of
the
movie
directed

's
most
inventive

was
shown
in
london
and
has
already
got

reviews
worldwide
and
has
scored

points

the

arises
what
the

has

thisdom
cobbdi
caprio
is
an
extractor
who
is
paid
to
invade
the
dreams
of
various
business
tycoons
and
steal
their
top
secret
ideas
.
cobb
robs
forcefully
the
psyche
with
practiced
skill
though
he
's
increasingly
haunted
by
the
memory
of
his
late
wife
mal
marion
cotillard
who
has
a
nasty
habit
of
showing
up
in
his
subconscious
and
wreaking
havoc
on
his
missions
.
cobb
had
been
involved
so
much
in

that
he
had
lost
his
lovebut
then
as
fate
had

saito
ken

hands
over
the
responsibility
of
dissolving
the

but
this
time
his
job
was
not
to
steal

to
plant

what
happens

arthur
joseph
gordon-levitt
his
longtime
organizer
tom
hardy
eames
a
``
forger
''
who
can
shapeshift
at
will
and
yusuf
dileep
rao
a
powerful
sedative
supplier
.
there
is
only
one
word
to
describe
the
cinematography
the
set
designs
and
the
special
effects
and
that
is
exceptional
you
do
n't
just
watch
the
scenes
happening
you
feel
them
.
the
movie
is
a
real
thrill
ride
.
the
action
scenes
are
well
picturised
and
the
music
by
hans
zimmer
is
electronically
haunting
.
never
in
the
runtime
of
the
movie
you
will
get
a
chance
to
move
your
eyes
from
the
screen
to
any
other
object.leonardo
who
is
still
popularly
known
for
jack
dawson
played
by
him
in
titanic
should
be
relieved
as
his
role
as
dom
cobb
will
be
remembered
forever
.
his
performance
may
or
may
not
fetch
him
an
oscar
but
it
will
be
his
finest
performance
till
date
.
the
supporting
cast
too
did
an
extraordinary
work
.
christopher
nolan
ah
what
a
man
he
is
.
his
work
is
nothing
less
than
a
masterpiece
and
he
deserves
all
the
awards
in
the
'best
director
'
category
.
if
``
inception
''
is
a
metaphysical
puzzle
it
's
also
a
metaphorical
one
it
's
hard
not
to
draw
connections
between
cobb
's
dream-weaving
and
nolan
's
film
making
intended
to
seduce
us
mess
with
our
heads
and
leave
an
ever-lasting
impression.to
conclude
i
would
just
say
before
your
life
ends
do
yourself
a
favor
by
experiencing
this
exceptionally
lucid
classic
created
by
nolan
