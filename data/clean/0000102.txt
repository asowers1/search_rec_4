ww2
suspense
novel
by
jeff
cordell
on
december
23
1999format
paperback
the
eagle
has
landed
is
probably
jack
higgins
best
work
.
for
almost
fifteen
years
prior
to
this
novels
publication
in
75
he
had
been
turning
out
potboilers
that
took
place
among
the
london
mob
the
ira
the
sicilian
mafia
ex-nazis
hiding
in
south
america
.
his
books
were
solid
enertaining
and
rather
forgettable
.
but
with
eagle
higgins
found
his
stride
.
it
's
a
classic
ww2
suspense
novel
which
takes
all
the
cliches
and
combines
them
to
make
a
rather
fresh
and
exciting
work
.
you
actually
find
yourself
hoping
the
german
commandos
pull
it
off
.
the
book
raised
a
few
eyebrows
when
it
came
out
because
it
was
written
predominately
from
the
german
point
of
view
and
the
germans
were
-
for
the
most
part
-
portrayed
positively
.
i
've
read
the
book
several
times
over
the
past
sixteen
years
and
have
viewed
the
movie
-
also
well
done
-
several
times
as
well
.
it
moves
quickly
and
is
very
engrossing
.
unfortunly
eagle
was
higgins
high
point
-
one
which
he
has
been
working
hard
to
recover
ever
since
.
his
following
books
have
been
allright
reading
but
he
's
never
approached
the
quality
of
the
eagle
has
landed
.
if
you
're
new
to
his
work
start
off
with
eagle
and
then
try
storm
warning
.
after
those
two
you
're
on
your
own
.
eagle
is
excellent
though
.

of
thriller

minev
on

2003format
mass
market
paperback
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
very
best
higgins
book
.
it
is
the
type
of
novel
that
once
into
it
the
reader
simply
can
not
put
down
especially
after
the
team
lands
in
england.the
premise
of
the
story
is
a
group
of
germans
that
have
a
mission
to
kidnap
churchill
.
the
leader
kurt
steiner
a
paratrooper
is
a
very
compelling
character
which
makes
th
readers
simpathize
with
him
.
on
the
other
side
is
liam
devlin
a
former
ira
fighter
helping
the
team
in
england.the
story
unfolds
seamlessly
with
the
german
team
recruiting
help
in
england
of
nazi
simpathizers
then
moving
in
and
planning
the
kidnap
at
churchill
's
country
estate.as
they
are
almost
ready
for
the
kidnapping
two
children
almost
drown
and
one
of
the
germans
tries
to
help
them
blowing
his
cover
.
then
i
should
say
no
more
as
the
story
becomes
a
thriller
that
the
reader
just
can
not
put
down
.
it
ends
in
an
unexpected
climax.though
early
in
higgins
'
career
i
think
this
remains
his
very
best
though
it
does
not
mean
his
later
books
are
bad
just
that
this
one
is
really
good
.

definitive
higgins
classic
by
mr
n
forbes-warren
on
june
23
2001format
mass
market
paperback
if
there
are
two
jack
higgins
books
you
absolutely
must
read
then
this
one
and
also
eye
of
the
storm
are
top
of
the
list
this
is
perhaps
his
best
known
one
in
the
uk
-
in
1943
germany
plots
the
ultimate
undercover
operation
where
an
assorted
ragbag
of
nazi
sympathisers
and
german
paratrooperskurt
steiner
being
the
main
character
here
clandestinely
invade
england
to
kidnap
prime
minister
winston
churchill
.
one
of
the
main
protagonists
is
liam
devlin
an
ira
fighter
who
teams
up
with
the
germans
and
enjoys
a
romance
with
farmhand
molly
prior
throughout
the
story
.
everything
seems
to
go
smoothly
until
two
children
almost
drown
and
one
of
the
germans
tries
to
rescue
them
-
and
the
residents
of
norfolk
village
studley
constablewhere
a
lot
of
the
action
takes
place
soon
discover
what
exactly
is
about
to
happen
.
at
this
pojnt
the
action
moves
swifty
and
builds
up
to
an
unexpected
climax
.
one
wonders
if
such
a
thing
really
did
happen
during
world
war
2
on
reading
the
closing
lines
in
the
book
.
.
.
you
never
know
a
real
page-turner
which
although
written
in
1975
is
still
a
winner
today
.
