production
development
the
idea
for
the
lion
king
was
conceived
in
late
1988
during
a
conversation
between
jeffrey
katzenberg
roy
e.
disney
and
peter
schneider
on
a
plane
to
europe
to
promote
oliver
company
.
during
the
conversation
the
topic
of
a
story
set
in
africa
came
up
and
katzenberg
immediately
jumped
at
the
idea.6
the
idea
was
then
developed
by
walt
disney
feature
animation
's
vice
president
for
creative
affairs
charlie
fink.7
katzenberg
decided
to
add
elements
involving
coming
of
age
and
death
and
ideas
from
personal
life
experiences
such
as
some
of
his
trials
in
his
bumpy
road
in
politics
saying
about
the
film
``
it
is
a
little
bit
about
myself
.
``
8
in
november
of
that
year
thomas
disch
author
of
the
brave
little
toaster
wrote
a
treatment
entitled
king
of
the
kalahari9
and
afterwards
linda
woolverton
spent
a
year
writing
drafts
of
the
script
which
was
titled
king
of
the
beasts
and
then
king
of
the
jungle.7
the
original
version
of
the
film
was
very
different
from
the
final
film
.
the
plot
was
centered
in
a
battle
being
between
lions
and
baboons
with
scar
being
the
leader
of
the
baboons
rafiki
being
a
cheetah8
and
timon
and
pumbaa
being
simba
's
childhood
friends.10
simba
would
also
not
leave
the
kingdom
but
become
a
``
lazy
slovenly
horrible
character
''
due
to
manipulations
from
scar
so
simba
could
be
overthrown
after
coming
of
age
.

completed

decided
to
attach
himself
to
the
project
``
because

are
cool
''

schumacher
likened
the
script
for
king
of
the
jungle
to
``
an
animated
national
geographic
special
''
.11
oliver
company
director
george
scribner
was
the
initial
director
of
the
film12
being
later
joined
by
roger
allers
who
was
the
lead
story
man
on
beauty
and
the
beast
in
october
1991.6
allers
brought
with
him
brenda
chapman
who
would
become
the
head
of
story.7
afterwards
several
of
the
lead
crew
members
including
allers
scribner
hahn
chapman
and
production
designer
chris
sanders
took
a
trip
to
hell
's
gate
national
park
in
kenya
in
order
to
study
and
gain
an
appreciation
of
the
environment
for
the
film.13
after
six
months
of
story
development
work
scribner
decided
to
leave
the
project
as
he
clashed
with
allers
and
the
producers
on
their
decision
to
turn
the
film
into
a
musical
as
scribner
's
intention
was
of
making
a
documentary-like
film
more
focused
on
natural
aspects.614
rob
minkoff
replaced
scribner13
and
producer
don
hahn
joined
the
production
as
schumacher
became
only
an
executive
producer
due
to
disney
promoting
him
to
vice
president
of
development
for
feature
animation.11
hahn
found
the
script
unfocused
and
lacking
a
clear
theme
and
after
establishing
the
main
theme
as
``
leaving
childhood
and
facing
up
to
the
realities
of
the
world
''
asked
for
a
final
retool
.
allers
minkoff
chapman
and
hahn
then
rewrote
the

the
script
also
had
its
title
changed
from

to
the
lion

as
the
setting
was
not

the

the
lion
king
was
the
first
disney
animated
feature
to
be
an
original
story
rather
than
being
based
on
an
already-existing
work
.
the
filmmakers
have
said
that
the
story
of
the
lion
king
was
inspired
by
the
joseph
and
moses
stories
from
the
bible
and
william
shakespeare
's
hamlet.15

were
chosen
for
how
they
fit

could
add
to

â
for
instance
james

was
cast
because
the

found
his

``

and
similar
to
a

jones
commented
that

either

all
the

had
to

done
through

the
use

present

vision
in

the
most
notable
use
of

is
in
the
``

look

five
specially
trained
animators

spent
more

two
years

usages
