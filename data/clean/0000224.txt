what
can
i
say
jurassic
park
is
one
of
the
most
underrated
movies
ever
.
yes
i
did
say
underrated
.
true
it
is
the
fourth
highest
grossing
movie
ever
for
the
time
being
and
was
a
motion
picture
bible
for
eight-year-olds
across
the
country
but
it
has
never
been
regarded
as
artistically
superior
.
when
in
reality
it
is
one
of
the
most
artistically
inventive
movies
ever
.
it
contains
all
of
spielberg
's
magical
strokes
of
genius
from
fantastic
art
direction
and
wonderful
camera
techniques
to
astounding
technical
quality
which
comes
from
his
well
known
control
over
technology
.
the
minor
flaws
of
a
theme
park
are
masterfully
embedded
into
the
art
direction
script
etc
.
and
the
acting
is
superb
.
this
is
one
of
the
only
movies
i
've
seen
with
great
acting
by
children
.
spielberg
's
camera
usage
ranges
from
foreshadowing
the
appearance
of
dinosaurs
with
extreme
up-angles
to
exquisitely
composed
scenes
of
the
dinosaurs
'
``
interaction
''
with
the
characters
.
aside
from
technical
quality
jurassic
park
bears
powerful
social
messages
of
human
intrusion
and
destruction
of
natural
environment
and
the
self-revering
nature
of
man
.
also
it
had
an
undeniable
effect
on
cinema
being
one
of
the
first
movies
to
use
cgi
at
such
a
large
scale
.
however
the
most
ingenious
aspect
of
the
film
is
the
portrayal
of
the
dinosaurs
as
animals
rather
than
ruthless
monsters
.
at
many
times
throughout
the
movie
the
humans
are
portrayed
as
antagonists
and
the
respect
and
appreciation
of
the
dinosaurs
is
wonderfully
developed
.
and
best
of
all
like
star
wars
you
can
analyze
the
movie
all
you
want
or
just
sit
back
and
enjoy
the
ride
.
