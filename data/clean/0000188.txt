a
journey

classic
tim

with
great
acting

everyone
in
this
movie
looked
like
they
were
having
so
much
fun
doing
it
and
it
showed
.
we
saw
this
in
digital
3d
and
to
be
honest
the
3d
may
not
even
have
been
needed

it
looks

digital

it

such
a
disappointment
tim
burton
just
slaughtered
the
story
and
the
3-d
was
horrible
johnny
depp
was
alright
same
goes
for
mia
wasikowska
.
just
a
waste
of
my
money
and
a
large
hole
of
hate
growing
for
tim
burton
the
story
had
no
heart
and
the
over
exaggeration
in
cgi
wasnt
helping

paul
oh
super
reviewer
this
is
one
of
the
hardest
films
for
me
to
confirm
whether
its
a
good
film
or
not
.
firstly
the
name
is
false
advertised
i
belileve
it
was
going
to
be
a
fresh
remake
instead
its
a
unnecessary
sequel
to
the
books
.
secondly
the
acting
cast
was
a
hit
and
miss
.
while
mia
wasikowska
makes
a
unique
protagonist
johnny
depp
is
once
again
placed
into
a
character
which
does
n't
fit
him
.
there
are
times
when
he
sound
more
like
'captain
jack
sparrow
'
.
helena
bonham
carter
does
make
a
strong
villian
as
the
red
queen
.
however
the
key
successes
for
this
film
are
its
stunning
effects
and
its
voice
cast
.
from
alan
rickman
to
stephen
fry
timothy
spall
barbara
windsor
and
michael
sheen
.
the
positives
and
negatives
are
so
balanced
i
would
n't
say
its
tim
burton
's
best
but
its
definetely
worth
a
try
.
