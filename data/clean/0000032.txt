postscript
by
the
killeredit
in
a
postscript
a
fishing
ship
picks
up
a
bottle
containing
a
written
confession
inside
its
trawling
nets
which
is
sent
to
scotland
yard
and
explains
the
events
but
has
been
left
to
chance
whether
it
will
be
discovered
.
it
is
signed
by
justice
wargrave
who
states
he
has
since
childhood
relished
causing
suffering
but
in
adulthood
he
determined
that
such
pain
be
meted
out
only
to
the
guilty
.
upon
hearing
of
a
chance
remark
of
possible
suspects
having
gotten
away
with
murder
and
having
learned
he
was
terminally
ill
with
a
relatively
short
time
to
live
he
decided
to
commit
murder
himself
locating
ten
individuals
who
had
knowingly
or
intentionally
caused
the
deaths
of
others
but
escaped
earthly
justice
however
not
every
case
was
murder
i.e
.
emily
brent
marston
.
by
using
a
stock
phrase
he
managed
to
trick
other
people
into
remarking
about
possible
murder
suspects
with
the
exceptions
of
marston
whom
he
choose
as
a
victim
because
of
his
amoral
and
cavalier
attitude
and
armstrong
whom
he
had
heard
had
committed
negligent
homicide
because
of
drink
during
an
anti
drinking
lecture
.
he
lured
nine
of
them
to
the
island
he
had
purchased
with
the
help
of
one
isaac
morris
and
pretended
to
be
a
tenth
visitor
like
them
.
experienced
in
observation
he
confirmed
all
were
guilty
by
their
reactions
to
the
phonograph
recording
.
his
tenth
killer
and
first
chronological
victim
was
his
sole
go-between
and
contact
morris
who
had
been
responsible
for
the
death
of
the
daughter
of
wargrave
's
friends
from
a
drug
overdose
.
morris
a
hypochondriac
constantly
complained
of
maladies
both
real
and
imagined
.
for
this
reason
he
accepted
a
cocktail
of
sleeping
medication
given
to
him
by
the
judge
who
promised
they
would
cure
his
upsets
however
proved
fatal
.
wargrave
first
killed
those
he
considered
less
culpable
saving
the
``
prolonged
mental
strain
and
fear
''
for
the
more
cold-blooded
perpetrators
slipping
potassium
cyanide
into
the
drink
of
marston
whom
he
felt
was
amoral
and
chloral
hydrate
into
the
drink
of
mrs.
rogers
who
acted
largely
under
the
influence
of
her
domineering
husband
.
after
bludgeoning
general
macarthur
with
a
life
preserver
and
rogers
the
butler
with
an
axe
the
judge
used
the
remaining
chloral
hydrate
as
a
sedative
in
miss
brent
's
coffee
before
injecting
her
with
potassium
cyanide
when
she
was
left
alone
in
the
kitchen
using
one
of
dr
armstrong
's
syringe
.
he
then
played
upon
armstrong
who
trusted
the
judge
whom
he
persuaded
to
go
along
with
a
plan
whereby
the
judge
would
fake
being
shot
dead
but
would
actually
remain
alive
and
thus
be
able
to
investigate
who
was
the
``
real
killer
''
.
after
wargrave
's
``
death
''
was
``
confirmed
''
by
armstrong
the
judge
met
with
his
dupe
secretly
that
night
along
the
rocks
overlooking
the
sea
and
pushed
him
off
the
cliff
where
he
drowned
at
a
location
where
the
body
would
wash
ashore
with
the
tide
.
after
dropping
the
clock
on
blore
he
correctly
surmised
that
vera
and
lombard
would
turn
on
each
other
but
that
she
would
be
more
than
a
worthy
opponent
and
manage
to
turn
the
tables
on
the
latter
.
at
which
point
he
placed
the
noose
and
chair
in
her
room
as
a
``
psychological
experiment
''
â
which
combined
with
her
``
hypnotic
''
posttraumatic
state
from
shooting
lombard
he
again
correctly
anticipated
would
lead
her
to
hang
herself
.
after
her
death
wargrave
describes
how
he
returned
the
chair
back
against
the
wall
and
wrote
his
confession
admitting
a
``
pitiful
human
need
''
for
recognition
which
he
will
throw
into
the
sea
in
a
bottle
before
shooting
himself
.
he
states
that
he
will
fasten
a
rubber
cord
to
lombard
's
gun
using
a
handkerchief
to
prevent
leaving
any
of
his
own
fingerprints
.
if
this
plan
works
as
intended
the
gun
will
recoil
after
firing
the
fatal
shot
through
the
forehead
leaving
him
exactly
as
described
in
the
others
'
diaries
with
the
gun
fallen
far
from
his
own
hand
.
the
cloth
on
the
floor
should
``
not
attract
any
attention
''
he
notes
.
he
concludes
that
when
the
police
arrive
``
they
will
find
ten

.
wargrave
points
out
three
clues
by
which
the
police
could
perhaps
identify
him
as
the
killer
but
surmises
correctly
that
the
police
will
not
figure
them
out
wargrave
was
the
only
``
innocent
''
guest
since
the
man
he
sentenced
to
deathâdespite
strong
public
belief
in
his
innocenceâwas
found
after
his
execution
to
have
been
unquestionably
guilty
of
the
crime
for
which
he
was
hanged
.
therefore
paradoxically
the
only
innocent
guest
had
to
be
``
the
''
murderer
the
``
red
herring
''
line
in
the
poem
suggests
that
armstrong
was
tricked
into
his
death
and
the
elderly
judge
would
have
been
the
person
most
likely
for
armstrong
to
trust
the
gunshot
wound
on
wargrave
's
forehead
is
symbolic
.
it
would
appear
similar
to
the
mark
god
placed
upon
cain
the
first
murderer
in
the
bible
as
a
sign
after
he
killed
his
brother
abel

investigator
accused
of
falsifying
his
testimony

bribe
from

he
was
instructed
to
do
by

for

confronted
about
his

against

privately
admits
the
truth
to

down
to
his
last
square
meal
he
comes
to
the
island
with
a
loaded
revolver
as
suggested
by
isaac

accused
of
causing
the
deaths

tribesmen
after
stealing
their
food
and

guests
to
openly
and
immediately
confirm
that
the
accusations
against
them
are
true
neither
feels
remorse
.

fulfilled

ninth
referenced
verse
of
the
rhyme

to
death
on
the
beach
by
vera
who
believed
him
to
be
the
murderer
.
of
all
the
``
guests

he
is
the
only
one
to
theorize
that

is
justice
wargrave

ironically
he
is
also
``
tricked

by
the
judge

into
circumstances
leading

his
own
``
execution

secretarial
jobs

job
as
a
governess
ended
in
the
death
of
her
charge
cyril
hamilton
whom
she
intentionally
allowed
to
swim
out
to
sea
â
as
the
child
had
wanted
to
do
but
had
theretofore
been
denied
as
too
dangerous
â
and
drown
.
she
did
this
so
her
lover
cyril
's
uncle
hugo
hamilton
could
become
the
family
heir
inherit
the
estate
and
marry
her
which
had
been
their
original
plan
before
cyril
's
birth
changed
things
.
she
swam
out
to
sea
to
``
save
''
cyril
to
make
it
seem
he
had
disobeyed
her
â
as
she
had
consistently
told
him
it
was
too
dangerous
â
but
knowing
she
would
not
arrive
in
time

hugo
however
who
loved
his
nephew
abandoned
her
after
he
somehow
sensed
what
she
had
done

after
shooting
lombard
in
what
she
believed
was
self-defense
she
returns
to
the
house
relieved
she
has
survived

she
goes
to

finds

complete
with

beneath
it
suspended
from

hook
hanging
from

in
a
combination
of
both
latent
guilt
for
her
crime
and
in
a
post-traumatic
state
she
adjusts
the
noose
round
her
neck
and
kicks
the
chair
away

fulfilling

final
verse

is
accused

leading

time
to
be

deliberate
miscarriage

there
is
a
certain
feeling

inescapable
in
the
regularity
of
the
deaths
which
is
better
suited
to
a
serialized
newspaper
story
than
a
full-length
novel
.
yet
there
is
an
ingenious
problem
to
solve
in

continued
.
``

astute

25

isaac
anderson
detailed
the
set-up
of
the
plot
up
to
the
point
where
``
the
voice
''
accuses
the
ten
``
guests
''
of
their
past
crimes
or
sins
which
have
all
resulted
in
the
deaths
of
other
human
beings
and
then
said
``
when
you
read
what
happens
after
that
you
will
not
believe
it
but
you
will
keep
on
reading
and
as
one
incredible
event
is
followed
by
another
even
more
incredible
you
will
still
keep
on
reading
.
the
whole
thing
is
utterly
impossible
and
utterly
fascinating
.
it
is
the
most
baffling
mystery
that
agatha
christie
has
ever
written
and
if
any
other
writer
has
ever
surpassed
it
for
sheer
puzzlement
the
name
escapes
our
memory
.
we
are
referring
of
course
to
mysteries
that
have
logical
explanations
as
this
one
has
.
it
is
a
tall
story
to
be
sure
but
it
could
have
happened
.
``
20
such
was
the
quality
of
christie
's
work
on
this
book
that
many
compared
it
to
her
1926
novel
the
murder
of
roger
ackroyd
.
for
instance
an
unnamed
reviewer
in
the
toronto
daily
star
of
16
march
1940
said
``
others
have
written
better
mysteries
than
agatha
christie
but
no
one
can
touch
her
for
ingenious
plot
and
surprise
ending
.
with
and
then
there
were
none
...
she
is
at
her
most
ingenious
and
most
surprising
...
is
indeed
considerably
above
the
standard
of
her
last
few
works
and
close
to
the
roger
ackroyd
level
.
``
21
other
critics
laud
the
use
of
plot
twists
and
surprise
endings
.
maurice
richardson
wrote
a
rhapsodic
review
in
the
observer
's
issue
of
5
november
1939
which
began
``
no
wonder
agatha
christie
's
latest
has
sent
her
publishers
into
a
vatic
trance
.
we
will
refrain
however
from
any
invidious
comparisons
with
roger
ackroyd
and
be
content
with
saying
that
ten
little
niggers
is
one
of
the
very
best
most
genuinely
bewildering
christies
yet
written
.
we
will
also
have
to
refrain
from
reviewing
it
thoroughly
as
it
is
so
full
of
shocks
that
even
the
mildest
revelation
would
spoil
some
surprise
from
somebody
and
i
am
sure
that
you
would
rather
have
your
entertainment
kept
fresh
than
criticism
pure
.
''
after
stating
the
set-up
of
the
plot
richardson
concluded
``
story
telling
and
characterisation
are
right
at
the
top
of
mrs
christie
's
baleful
form
.
her
plot
may
be
highly
artificial
but
it
is
neat
brilliantly
cunning
soundly
constructed
and
free
from
any
of
those
red-herring
false
trails
which
sometimes
disfigure
her
work
.
``

robert
barnard
a
recent
critic
concurred
with
the
reviews
describing
the
book
as
``
suspenseful
and
menacing
detective-story-cum-thriller
.
the
closed
setting
with
the
succession
of
deaths
is
here
taken
to
its
logical
conclusion
and
the
dangers
of
ludicrousness
and
sheer
reader-disbelief
are
skillfully
avoided
.
probably
the
best-known
christie
and
justifiably
among
the
most
popular
.
``
22
the
original
name
of
the
mystery
ten
little
niggers
has
long
been
abandoned
as
offensive
in
english-speaking
countries
and
a
number
of
others
.
some
critics
have
opined
that
christie
's
original
title
and
the
setting
on
``
nigger
island
''
later
changed
to
``
indian
island
''
and
``
soldier
island
''
variously
are
perhaps
integral
to
the
work
.
these
aspects
of
the
novel
argues
alison
light
``
could
be
relied
upon
automatically
to
conjure
up
a
thrilling
'otherness
'
a
place
where
revelations
about
the
'dark
side
'
of
the
english
would
be
appropriate
.
``
23
unlike
novels
such
as
heart
of
darkness
``
christie
's
location
is
both
more
domesticated
and
privatised
taking
for
granted
the
construction
of
racial
fears
woven
into
psychic
life
as
early
as
the
nursery
.
if
her
story
suggests
how
easy
it
is
to
play
upon
such
fears
it
is
also
a
reminder
of
how
intimately
tied
they
are
to
sources
of
pleasure
and
enjoyment
