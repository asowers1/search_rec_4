biography
the
best-selling
female
performer
of
the
1990s
and
one
of
the
most
popular
artists
through
the
2010s
mariah
carey
rose
to
superstardom
on
the
strength
of
her
stunning
five-octave
voice
.
an
elastic
talent
who
moved
easily
from
glossy
ballads
to
hip-hop-inspired
dance-pop
she
earned
frequent
comparison
to
rivals
whitney
houston
and
celine
dion
but
did
them
both
one
better
by
co-writing
almost
all
her
material
.
like
all
artists
with
lengthy
periods
in
the
mainstream
spotlight
carey
experienced
creative
and
commercial
lulls
yet
each
one
of
her
proper
studio
albums
peaked
within
the
top
five
of
the
billboard
200
.
born
in
long
island
new
york
on
march
27
1970
carey
moved
to
new
york
city
at
the
age
of
17
just
one
day
after
graduating
high
school
to
pursue
a
music
career
there
she
befriended
keyboardist
ben
margulies
with
whom
she
began
writing
songs
.
her
big
break
came
as
a
backing
vocalist
on
a
studio
session
with
dance-pop
singer
brenda
k.
starr
who
handed
carey
's
demo
tape
to
columbia
records
head
tommy
mottola
at
a
party
.
according
to
legend
mottola
listened
to
the
tape
in
his
limo
while
driving
home
that
same
evening
and
was
so
immediately
struck
by
carey
's
talent
that
he
doubled
back
to
the
party
to
track
her
down
.
after
signing
to
columbia
carey
entered
the
studio
to
begin
work
on
her
1990
self-titled
debut
lp
.
the
heavily
promoted
album
was
a
chart-topping
smash
launching
no
less
than
four
number
one
singles
``
vision
of
love
''
``
love
takes
time
''
``
someday
''
and
``
i
do
n't
wan
na
cry
.
''
her
overnight
success
earned
grammy
awards
as
best
new
artist
and
best
female
vocalist
and
expectations
were
high
for
carey
's
follow-up
1991
's
emotions
.
the
album
did
not
disappoint
as
the
title
track
reached
number
one
a
record
fifth
consecutive
chart-topper
while
both
``
ca
n't
let
go
''
and
``
make
it
happen
''
landed
in
the
top
five
.
carey
's
next
release
was
1992
's
mtv
unplugged
ep
which
generated
a
number
one
cover
of
the
jackson
5
's
``
i
'll
be
there
.
''
featured
on
the
track
was
backup
singer
trey
lorenz
whose
appearance
immediately
helped
him
land
a
recording
contract
of
his
own
.
in
june
1993
carey
wed
mottola
some
two
decades
her
senior
in
a
headline-grabbing
ceremony
months
later
she
released
her
third
full-length
effort
music
box
which
became
her
best-selling
record
to
date
.
two
more
singles
``
dreamlover
''
and
``
hero
''
reached
the
top
spot
on
the
charts
.
carey
's
first
tour
followed
and
was
widely
panned
by
critics
undaunted
she
resurfaced
in
1994
with
a
holiday
release
titled
merry
christmas
scoring
a
seasonal
smash
with
``
all
i
want
for
christmas
is
you
.
''
released
in
1995
daydream
reflected
a
new
artistic
maturity
the
first
single
``
fantasy
''
debuted
at
number
one
making
carey
the
first
female
artist
and
just
the
second
performer
ever
to
accomplish
the
feat
.
the
follow-up
``
one
sweet
day
''
a
collaboration
with
boyz
ii
men
repeated
the
trick
and
remained
lodged
at
the
top
of
the
charts
for
a
record
16
weeks
.
after
separating
from
mottola
carey
returned
in
1997
with
butterfly
another
staggering
success
and
her
most
hip-hop-flavored
recording
to
date
.
1
's
a
collection
featuring
her
13
previous
chart-topping
singles
as
well
as
``
the
prince
of
egypt
when
you
believe
''
a
duet
with
whitney
houston
effectively
pairing
the
two
most
successful
female
recording
artists
in
pop
history
followed
late
the
next
year
.
with
``
heartbreaker
''
the
first
single
from
her
1999
album
rainbow
carey
became
the
first
artist
to
top
the
charts
in
each
year
of
the
1990s
the
record
also
pushed
her
ahead
of
the
beatles
as
the
artist
with
the
most
cumulative
weeks
spent
atop
the
hot
100
singles
chart.however
the
early
2000s
were
n't
as
kind
to
carey
.
after
signing
an
80
million
deal
in
2001
with
virgin
the
biggest
record
contract
ever
she
experienced
a
very
public
personal
and
professional
meltdown
that
included
rambling
suicidal
messages
on
her
website
an
appearance
on
trl
where
clad
only
in
a
t-shirt
she
handed
out
popsicles
to
the
audience
and
last
but
not
least
the
poorly
received
movie
glitter
and
its
attendant
soundtrack
which
was
also
her
virgin
records
debut
.
the
film
did
poorly
critically
as
well
as
commercially
making
just
under
4
million
in
its
total
u.s.
gross
.
despite
this
the
soundtrack
eventually
went
platinum
.
following
these
setbacks
virgin
and
carey
parted
ways
early
in
2002
with
the
label
paying
her
28
million
.
that
spring
she
found
a
new
home
with
islanddef
jam
where
she
set
up
her
own
label
monarc
music
.
in
december
she
released
her
ninth
album
charmbracelet
her
first
proper
studio
album
to
go
merely
platinum
rather
than
multi-platinum.the
emancipation
of
mimi
her
most
successful
work
in
years
appeared
in
2005
.
it
climbed
to
multi-platinum
status
and
earned
carey
three
grammy
awards
best
contemporary
rb
album
and
for
the
single
``
we
belong
together
''
best
female
rb
vocal
performance
and
best
rb
song
thus
restoring
her
status
as
a
megastar
.
two
weeks
before
the
release
of
her
subsequent
album
2008
's
emc2
carey
scored
her
18th
number
one
hit
with
``
touch
my
body
''
a
feat
that
pushed
her
into
second
place
past
elvis
no
less
among
all
artists
with
the
most
chart-topping
singles
.
although
that
hit
song
along
with
the
late
april
news
that
she
had
married
nick
cannon
kept
her
in
the
spotlight
that
year
the
remainder
of
the
album
's
spinoffs
were
n't
nearly
as
successful
only
``
bye
bye
''
managed
to
scrape
the
top
20
of
the
billboard
hot
100.carey
went
back
to
work
fairly
quickly

became
her
12th

despite
some
positive
reviews
it
was
her
least
successful

album
only

its
singles
