united

see
all
my
reviews
i
have
got
to
tell
anyone
who
will
listen
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
adventure
movies
i
've
ever
seen
.
it
's
almost
impossible
to
convey
how
pumped
i
am
now
that
i
've
seen
it
.
i
purposefully
avoid
hyping
myself
for
movies
because
when
expectations
are
too
high
nothing
seems
to
be
able
to
reach
them
.
i
usually
avoid
the
hype
train
whenever
possible
.
that
said
i
was
jacked
to
see
this
movie
and
was
fully
aboard
the
hype
train
.
it
could
n't
be
helped
.
so
i
was
certainly
open
to
intense
disappointment
had
this
movie
not
been
good
.
i
'm
so
happy
to
report
just
the
opposite
has
happened.the
only
word
i
can
think
of
to
describe
this
movie
is
awesome
.
it
's
amazing
work
and
everything
i
had
hoped
for
and
more
.
it
's
exceptional
entertainment
for
the
uninitiated
but
it
has
everything
a
fanboy
could
want
to
be
sure
.
it
has
every
little
nuance
of
what
a
fanboy
wants
to
see
.
one
of
the
many
things
i
loved
was
the
tension
and
flat
out
conflict
that
arises
between
team
members
.
it
's
not
a
two
dimensional
``
team
wonderful
that
bands
together
to
fight
crime
ho
ho
ho
.
''
most
do
n't
like
each
other
at
fist
and
there
is
so
much
texture
to
be
played
.
that
is
great
because
so
many
of
these
characters
are
larger
than
life
.
they
have
egos
and
the
big
guns
are
n't
used
to
working
with
other
people
or
even
playing
by
the
rules
.
stark
thor
and
banner
all
work
``
the
other
side
of
the
fence
''
so
to
speak
.
then
there
's
the
widow
hawkeye
and
captain
america
who
are
used
to
following
orders
and
playing
within
a
command
structure
.
they
are
all
thrown
together
in
a
wonderful
and
best
of
all
believable
fashion
.
again
more
than
i
ever
dreamed
possible.the
entire
cast
really
delivered
.
you
needed
more
than
just
action
actors
or
stunt
doubles
to
play
all
these
parts
.
the
pathos
is
there
but
so
are
the
timing
and
true
deep
performances
.
look
i
was
missing
ed
norton
as
much
as
anyone
on
that
hype
train
i
talked
about
but
i
'm
so
happy
to
say
that
mark
ruffalo
won
me
over
.
i
hope
he
's
locked
up
for
the
long
haul
because
we
do
n't
need
any
more
changes
.
three
was
the
lucky
number
for
movie
banners
.
every
other
actor
in
avnegers
that
we
've
seen
before
is
better
than
their
previous
incarnation
every
single
one
with
the
possible
exception
of
rdj
as
stark
.
he
's
great
but
it
's
hard
to
top
his
take
on
the
character
from
the
original
iron
man
in
an
ensemble
movie
.
i
also
have
to
fully
disclose
that
i
'm
insanely
attracted
to
scarlett
johansson
.
i
thought
her
widow
character
was
amazing
but
i
'm
definitely
judging
that
through
rose
colored
glasses
.
the
character
arcs
that
run
there
course
during
this
film
will
surprise
a
lot
of
general
audiences
expecting
nothing
more
than
a
transformers
type
popcorn
scarfdown.i
honestly
do
n't
want
to
give
away
any
of
the
movie
with
this
review
because
this
is
one
film
that
needs
every
scene
to
be
savored
.
do
yourself
a
favor
and
remain
unspoiled
.
it
's
how
i
saw
the
movie
apart
from
what
the
trailers
showed
and
even
though
you
're
obviously
reading
this
review
read
no
others
with
any
kind
of
spoilers
whatsoever
.
experience
the
awesomeness
for
yourself
.
avengers
as
a
movie
and
as
a
team
on
screen
is
an
unstoppable
force
.
i
'm
just
going
to
say
hulk
thor
combination
equals
awesome
and
leave
it
at
that
.
this
movie
defines
must
see
.
