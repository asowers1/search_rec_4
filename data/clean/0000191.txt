in
spite
of
having
to
read
many
negative
reviews
i
was
still
curious
to
see
this
movie
.
i
not
a
huge
burton
fan
neither
although
i
've
enjoyed
some
of
his
previous
work
.
but
it
was
something
about
âalice
in
wonderlandâ
which
seemed
appealing
its
visual
look
and
its
quirky
characters
.
still
i
had
in
mind
the
several
hostile
reviews
which
accused
this
movie
to
be
a
flat
soulless
and
muddled
attempt
of
a
classic
which
i
also
feared
it
would
.
but
after
finally
seeing
the
movie
i
can
claim
my
disagreement
with
the
reviewers
.
in
fact
i
'm
not
sure
if
we
even
saw
the
same
movie
.
what
exactly
was
so
terrible
about
itoverall
i
found
âalice
in
wonderlandâ
to
be
very
entertaining
.
i
feared
that
the
movie
would
lose
some
of
it
's
magic
as
the
main
character
entered
to
wonderland
but
fortunately
it
never
did
.
i
enjoyed
the
movie
from
the
very
start
to
its
very
end
.
it
's
a
cute
fantasyadventure
movie
equal
to
the
âharry
potterâ
and
the
ânarniaâ
flicks
although
i
personally
felt
âprince
caspainâ
had
some
slight
weaknesses
.
but
beware
there
are
some
frightening
creatures
that
may
scare
the
youngest
in
the
audience
so
the
pg
rating
is
suitable.one
of
the
films
biggest
advantages
is
it
visuals
.
with
it
lush
and
dark
landscapes
cute
animals
and
colorful
costumes
the
flick
is
beautifully
to
look
at
and
i
ca
n't
wait
to
enjoy
the
sharpness
of
the
picture
on
blu
ray
.
the
score
of
danny
elfman
is
effective
and
gives
the
movie
a
dreamy
atmospheric
tone
.
the
characters
are
mostly
passable
.
they
do
n't
steal
the
show
entirely
but
neither
do
they
appear
as
distractive
or
annoying.read

trippy
trip
down
the
rabbit
hole
by
monkdude
on
april
17
2010format
blu-ray
for
starters
it
seems
that
everyone
i
know
is
shocked
when
i
tell
them
that
this
alice
in
wonderland
is
a
sequel
of
sorts
.
at
the
age
of
19
and
about
to
be
forced
into
marriage
this
is
alice
's
second
trip
to
wonderland
.
i
'm
glad
tim
burton
and
his
team
came
up
with
a
new
story
that
still
featured
all
the
great
characters
from
the
original
source
material
.
that
's
also
where
the
weakest
part
of
the
movie
lies
.
the
dialogue
given
to
the
characters
is
great
but
the
script
is
razor
thin
.
i
think
if
more
effort
went
into
this
particular
aspect
i
might
have
given
it
five
stars.i
saw
it
in
imax
3-d
and
the
visuals
are
as
grand
and
beautiful
as
you
would
expect
from
burton
.
it
's
not
quite
as
eye-popping
as
avatar
which
was
shot
completely
in
imax
3-d
whereas
alice
in
wonderland
was
upconverted
clash
of
the
titans
did
the
same
thing
to
bad
effect
.
the
music
by
danny
elfman
is
some
of
his
best
stuff
in
recent
years
and
the
costumesmakeup
are
top
notch.aside
from
the
look
of
film
the
acting
also
makes
it
very
memorable
.
there
are
so
many
well
animated
and
voice
acted
characters
running
around
i
do
n't
know
where
to
begin
.
i
guess
i
'll
start
with
those
made
of
flesh
and
blood
.
i
did
n't
like
depp
's
take
on
willy
wonka
that
much
and
i
'm
a
big
fan
of
his
but
his
mad
hatter
is
just
the
right
amount
of
crazy
.
his
voice
goes
back
and
forth
from
having
a
lisp
to
sounding
like
william
wallace
from
braveheart
.
his
look
is
so
jarring
you
probably
would
n't
even
know
it
was
him
if
you
somehow
dodged
all
the
advertisements
before
entering
the
theater
.
helena
bonham
carter
played
the
red
queen
brilliantly
.
i
could
n't
take
my
eyes
off
her
giant
head.read

alice
same
issues
by
john
d.
muir
on
september
5
2010format
dvd
most
of
the
many
attempts
at
filming
alice
in
wonderland
have
n't
been
particularly
successful
for
two
reasons
.
first
directors
seem
to
feel
that
the
movie
must
have
a
strong
male
character
.
lewis
carroll
did
n't
give
them
one
all
the
male
characters
in
the
books
are
rather
spineless
and
feeble
so
they
invent
their
own
usually
for
some
reason
the
mad
hatter
.
second
they
misread
the
character
of
alice
.
in
the
book
she
is
headstrong
inquisitive
and
feisty
she
dominates
the
other
characters
even
as
she
takes
part
in
their
fantastic
world
.
she
is
not
a
spectator
watching
what
they
do
but
a
full
participant
accepting
.
or
more
often
rejecting
their
view
of
life
.
she
's
not
nor
is
she
meant
to
be
a
nice
girl
meekly
accepting
what
befalls
her.unfortunately
tim
burton
's
'alice
'
falls
into
both
these
traps
.
instead
of
being
a
passing
character
alice
meets
along
the
way
the
mad
hatter
becomes
central
to
the
film
and
in
doing
so
destroys
much
of
the
point
of
the
tale
.
alice
herself
though
she
has
her
moments
of
rebellion
is
played
far
too
passively
she
's
more
often
merely
watching
what
goes
on
in
wonderland
.
in
making
her
character
too
detached
burton
loses
the
involvement
that
the
audience
should
feel
and
which
has
made
the
books
so
successful
for
so
long.on
the
plus
side
wonderland
itself
is
marvelously
realized
.
i
love
the
bright
colors
the
ever-more-convincing
computer
graphics
and
the
strange
flora
and
fauna
which
inhabit
this
suitably
dream-like
place
.
everything
looks
as
it
's
supposed
to-
distorted
versions
of
reality
only
possible
in
the
imagination
.
the
story
meanders
far
from
the
original
tales
but
i
have
no
problem
with
that
as
long
as
it
holds
together
.
tim
burton
is
the
master
at
making
a
fantasy
world
come
to
life.it
's
a
fun
movie
to
watch
.
it
just
does
n't
make
the
audience
feel
involved
.
