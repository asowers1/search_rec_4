1977
this
is
perhaps
the
most
elegant
of
abba
's
breakup
songs
.
it
was
actually
recorded
before
relationship
issues
between
the
members
were
made
public
.
the
song
is
filled
with
the
gloom
of
an
empty
house
no
more
laughter
and
bad
days
.
``

was
a

20
pop

is
one
of

praised
by
peers
.
in
particular
john
lennon
and
pete
townshend
publicly
stated
their
esteem
for
the
song
.
there
is
an
ominous
sound
in
the
rhythm
and
chord
structure
that
led
to
more
sophistication
in
the
sound
of
abba

pop
hits

this
song

not

a
remixed
version
of
``

soared
on
the
american
dance
charts
resulting

the
descending
sound
of
the
vocals
at
the
end
of
each
verse
coupled
with
a
hymn-like
chorus
make
``
lay

the
most

of
abba

``
fernando
''

1976
''
fernando
''
was
originally
written
and
recorded
in
swedish
by
abba
member
anni-frid
lyngstad
as
a
solo
effort
.
due
to
the
success
of
that
version
in
sweden
the
group
decided
to
record
it
in
english
as
an
abba
record
.
the
nostalgic
feel
of
``
fernando
''
helped
the
song
to
become
one
of
abba
's
biggest
hits
.
it
spent
an
incredible
14
weeks
at
1
in
australia
remaining
one
of
the
biggest
pop
hits
of
all
time
there
.
``

1979
abba
created
a
rock
disco
approach
for
``

''
unlike
most
abba
classics
the
lead
vocal
is
taken
by
bjorn
ulvaeus
instead
of
the
women
in
the
group
.
perhaps
because
of
the
deviation
from
the
classic
abba
song
``
does
your
mother
know
''
only
reached
4
in
the
uk
instead
of
topping

although
many
fans
believe
``
the
winner
takes
it
all
''
in
its
depiction
of
the
bitter
end
of
a
relationship
was
written
to
reflect
the
divorce
of
members
bjorn
ulvaeus
and
agnetha
faltskog
ulvaeus
himself
says
the
song
is
fiction
and
only
depicts
the
experience
of
divorce
.
the
song
has
a
nearly
overwhelming
feeling
of
sadness
and
pain
.
``
the
winner

was
a
1
hit
in

many
consider
``
mamma
mia
''
a
song
that
``
saved
''
abba
.
following
the
eurovision
success
of
``
waterloo
''
many
dismissed
the
group
as
a
bit
of
a
one-hit
wonder
.
however
in
1975
the
single
``
sos
''
hit
the
top
10
and
then
it
was
followed
by
``
mamma

''
that
became
the
group
's
second

today
it
is
best
known
as
the
title
song

phenomenally
successful
musical
