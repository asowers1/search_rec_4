daryl
hall
and
john
oates
are
hitting
the
big
screen
on
feb.
19
with
their
concert
film
``
hall
oates
live
in
dublin
''
and
the
legendary
duo
stopped
by
huffpost
live
on
wednesday
to
share
stories
from
their
45-year
career
--
including
the
time
michael
jackson
admitted
to
borrowing
from
them
.
hall
had
a
conversation
with
the
king
of
pop
in
1985
about
the
hall
oates
song
``
i
ca
n't
go
for
that
no
can
do
''
which
he
shared
with
host
marc
lamont
hillwe
were
doing
the
``
we
are
the
world
''
session
...
and
michael
came
up
to
me
in
conversation
and
he
goes
``
hey
man
i
hope
you
do
n't
mind
if
i
stole
'no
can
do
.
'
''
and
i
went
``
what
do
you
mean
you
stole
'no
can
do
'
''
he
said
``
nah
man
i
used
it
for
'bille
jean
.
'
''
i
said
``
it
does
n't
sound
like
'no
can
do
'
to
me
''
even
though
it
was
``
pretty
cool
''
to
hear
that
from
jackson
hall
said
he
sees
no
similarity
between
the
two
songs
and
the
encounter
was
a
great
example
of
the
mysterious
ways
inspiration
works
for
every
individual
musician
.
``
that
just
goes
to
show
you
though
an
artist
can
take
something
that
even

is
you
know
