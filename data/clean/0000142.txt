downey

that
he
initially
pushed
whedon
to
make
stark
the
lead
``
well
i
said
'i
need
to
be
in

i
do

tony

to
drive
this

'
he
was
like
'okay
let
's
try
that
.
'
we
tried
it
and
it
did
n't
work
because
this
is
a
different
sort
of
thing
the
story

the
idea

in

was
an

he
was
his
own
epiphany

by
an

serum

waking
up

evans
was
cast
as
part
of
a
deal
to
star
in
three
marvel
films
in
addition
to
the
avengers.9
evans
said
that
steve
rogers
is
much
darker
in
the
avengers
``
it
's
just
about
him
trying
to
come
to
terms
with
the
modern
world
.
you
've
got
to
imagine
it
's
enough
of
a
shock
to
accept
the
fact
that
you
're
in
a
completely
different
time
but
everybody
you
know
is
dead
.
everybody
you
cared
about
.
.
.
he
was
a
soldier
obviously
everybody
he
went
to
battle
with
all
of
his
brothers
in
arms
they
're
all
dead
.
he
's
just
lonely
.
i
think
in
the
beginning
it
's
a
fish-out-of-water
scene
and
it
's
tough
.
it
's
a
tough
pill
for
him
to
swallow
.
then
comes
trying
to
find
a
balance
with
the
modern

7
regarding
the
dynamic
between

``
i
think
there
's
certainly
a
dichotomyâthis
kind
of
friction
between
myself
and
tony
stark
they
're
polar
opposites
.
one
guy
is
flash
and
spotlight
and
smooth
and
the
other
guy
is
selfless
and
in
the
shadows
and
kind
of
quiet
and
they
have
to
get
along
.
they
explore
that
and
it
's
pretty
fun

who
was
considered
to

in

incredible

before
edward

took

role11

cast
after
negotiations
between

broke
down.12
about
replacing
norton
ruffalo
said
``
i
'm
a
friend
of
ed
's
and
yeah
that
was
n't
a
great
way
for
all
that
to
go
down
.
but
the
way
i
see
it
is
that

has
bequeathed
this
part
to
me
.
i
look
at
it
as
my
generation
's
hamlet

about
the
character
he
said
``
he
's
a
guy
struggling
with
two
sides
of
himselfâthe
dark
and
the
lightâand
everything
he
does
in
his
life
is
filtered
through
issues
of
control

i
grew
up
on
the
bill
bixby
tv
series
which
i
thought
was
a
really
nuanced
and
real
human
way
to
look
at
the
hulk
.
i
like
that
the
part
has
those
qualities
''
.13
in
october
2014
norton
claimed
he
chose
never
to
play
hulk
again
because
he
``
wanted
more
diversity
''
with
his
career
and
did
not
want
to
be
associated
with
only
one
character.14
regarding
the
hulk
's
place
on
the
team
ruffalo
said
``
he
's
like
the
teammate
none
of
them
are
sure
they
want
on
their
team
.
he
's
a
loose
cannon
.
it
's
like
'just
throw
a
grenade
in
the
middle
of
the
group
and
let
's
hope
it
turns
out
well
''
15
this
is
the
first
production
in
which
the
actor
playing
banner
also
plays
the
hulk
.
ruffalo
told
new
york
magazine
``
i
'm
really
excited
.
no
one
's
ever
played
the
hulk
exactly
they
've
always
done
cgi
.
they
're
going
to
do
the
avatar
stop-action
stop-motion
capture

so
i
'll
actually
play
the

that
'll
be
fun

the

the
hulk
's
face
was
modeled

to
create
the
hulk
's
voice
ruffalo
's
voice
was
blended
with
those
of

however
the
hulk

only

prince

norse
mythological
deity

as
part
of
a
multiple
movie
deal.20
he
had
previously
worked
with
joss

on

cabin
in

woods.21
hemsworth
said
that
he
was
able
to
maintain
the
strength
he
built
up
for
thor
by
increasing
his
food
intake
consisting
of
chicken
breasts
fish
steak
and
eggs
every
day
.
when
asked
exactly
how
much
hemsworth
said
``
my
body
weight
in
protein
pretty
much
''
22
he
remarked
that
thor
's
motivation
``
is
much
more
of
a
personal
one
in
the
sense
that
it
's
his
brother
that
is
stirring
things
up
.
whereas
everyone
else
it
's
some
bad
guy
who
they
've
got
ta
take
down
.
it
's
a
different
approach
for
me
or
for
thor
.
he
's
constantly
having
to
battle
the
greater
good
and
what
he
should
do
vs.
it
's
his
little
brother
there
.
.
.
i
've
been
frustrated
with
my
brothers
at
times
or
family
but
i
'm
the
only
one
who
is
allowed
to
be
angry
at
them

there
's
a
bit
of
that

about

when

at

subjugate

his

is
to
rule
the

king

and
like
all
the
delusional
autocrats
of

he
thinks
this
is
a
great
idea
because
if
everyone
is
busy
worshipping
him
there
will
be
no
wars
so
he
will
create
some
kind
of
world
peace
by
ruling
them
as
a
tyrant

he
is
also
kind
of
deluded
in
the
fact
that
he
thinks
unlimited
power

give

self-respect

i
have
n't
let
go
of
the
fact
that
he
is

motivated

this
terrible
jealousy

kind
of
spiritual
desolation

of
the

explaining
that
``
shooting
1.851
is
kind
of
unusual
for
an
epic
film
like
this
but
we
needed
the
height
in
the

to
be
able
to
frame
in
all
the
characters
like
hulk
captain
america

is
much
smaller

we
had
to
give
them

width

also
joss
whedon
knew
the

battle
sequence
was
going

the
height

of

were

naturalistic

we

did

we

whedon
said
that
it
was
his
decision
to
include
thanos
in
a
post-credits
scene
although
the
character
is
not
identified
in
the
film
.
``
he
for
me
is
the
most
powerful
and
fascinating
marvel
villain
.
he
's
the
great
grand
daddy
of
the
badasses
and
he
's
in
love
with
death
and
i
just
think
that
's
so
cute
.
for
me
the
greatest
avengers
comic
book
was
avengers
annual
7
1977
that
jim
starlin
did
followed
by
marvel
two-in-one
annual
2
1977
that
contained
the
death
of
adam
warlock
.
those
were
some
of
the
most
important
texts
and
i
think
underrated
milestones
in
marvel
history
and
thanos
is
all
over
that
so
somebody
had
to
be
in
control
and
had
to
be
behind
loki
's
work
and
i
was
like
'it
's

said
``
i
've
worked
on
films
where
there
have
been
a
number
of
stars
and
certainly
worked
on
films
where
there
have
been
characters
of
equal
weight
in
terms
of
their
level
of
importance
and
profile
in
the
film
but
this
one
is
somewhat
extreme
in
that
regard
because
each
of
these
characters
has
their
own
world
and
it
's
a
very
different
situation
.
it
's
very
challenging
to
look
for
a
way
to
give
everyone
the
weight
and
consideration
they
need
but
at
the
same
time
the
film
is
really
about
the
coming
together
of
these
characters
which
implies
that
there
is
this
entity
called
the
avengers
which
really
has
to
be
representative
of
all
of
them
together

the

is
very
old-fashioned
which
is
why
silvestri
was

``
it

finally
i
thought
'i
just
have
to
work
with
human
voices
.
'
...
i
just
started
playing
combinations
and
i
would
give
them
10
to
15
variations
of
roars
.
and
joss
listened
to
them
and
came
back
and
said
'i
like
this
one
'
and
i
went
back
and
i
looked
at
the
ingredients
of
what
was
in
that
one
.
turned
out
to
be
mark
ruffalo
some
lou
ferrigno
and
a
little
bit
of
me
and
two
people
from
new
zealand
.
so
i
led
with
that
and
i
started
using
those
combinations
but
changing
it
up
.
but
the
great
thing
was
that
mark
ruffalo
had
done
an
incredible
unintelligible
of
variety
so
i
was
always
blending
him
in
.
...
lou
ferrigno
seemed
to
have
a
real
knack
for
just
who
this
character
was
.
...
they
were
always
a
component
of
it

he

there
will
be
no

he
will

peace

he
is
