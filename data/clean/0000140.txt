what
parents
need
to
know
positive
messagesearly
20th-century
class
issues
are
at
the
heart
of
the
conflict
between
jack
and
rose
's
whirlwind
relationship
.
high-society
folks
did
n't
socialize
with
those
beneath
their
status
at
the
time
but
jack
and
rose
fall
in
love
despite
those
societal
trappings
proving
that
a
person
's
worth
is
far
greater
than
the
station
they
were
born
into
.
both
of
them
overcome
numerous
obstacles
to
be
together
.
the
idea
that
first-class
passengers
'
lives
are
somehow
more
important
than
lesser-class
passengers
is
exposed
as
disgusting
.
positive
role
modelsjack
and
rose
transcend
societal
expectations
and
fall
in
love
with
each
other
acting
bravely
to
help
save
themselves
and
others
.
the
``
haves
''
for
the
most
part
--
excepting
molly
brown
the
captain
and
the
ship
architect
--
are
n't
the
most
admirable
lot
.
many
people
onboard
act
selfishly
like
cal
who
pretends
a
small
child
is
his
to
get
a
spot
on
a
lifeboat
or
the
shipworker
who
refuses
to
allow
his
half-filled
lifeboat
to
return
to
save
more
people

almost
everyone

there
are
close-ups
of
some
passengers
who
choose
to
never
even
attempt

to
await
the
inevitable
in

rooms

lounges

parents
need
to
know
parents
need
to
know
that
james
cameron
's
king-of-the-world
saga
titanic
is
one
of
the
highest-grossing
movies
of
all
time
and
is
still
sure
to
attract
young
teen
and
tween
audiences
.
there

and
sexuality
jack
and
rose
make
love
in
the
backseat
of
a
car
but
the
forbidden
romance
between
the
main
characters
played
by
kate
winslet
and
leonardo
dicaprio
is
otherwise
rather
chaste
by
today
's
pg-13
standards
.
it
's
the
epic
titanic
sinking
scene
that
may
make
this
movie
too
intense
for
younger
kids
.
throughout
the
mass
chaos
people
are
fighting
shooting
at
each
other
plunging
to
their
watery
deaths
and
in
some
cases
even
committing
suicide
.
the
fact
that
this
is
based
on
a
historical
event
may
be
too
intense
for
sensitive
children
but
mature
kids
fascinated
with
the
titanic
will
find
it
compelling
to
watch
.

when
a
high-tech
underwater
mission
uncovers
hidden
treasures
from
the
legendary
ship

girl

a
nearly
100-year-old
woman
gloria

reveals
that
she

as
in
most
of
cameron
's
movies
the
romantic
relationship
led
by
a
strong
central
female
character

the
heart
of
titanic
while
the
action
and
special
effects
are
what
draw
in
equal
numbers
of
women
and
men
.
it
's
safe
to
say
that
many
young
teenage
girls
could
n't
give
a
hoot
about
the
titanic
breaking
in
half
whereas
some
guys
will
be
counting
the
minutes
until
the
ship
starts
to
sink
.
but
that
's
the
magic
of
titanic
--
a
young
boy
can
gloss
right
over
the
romance
and
focus
on
the
action
while
a
teenage
girl
can
concentrate
on
the
swoon-worthy
love
story
and
grown-ups
can
sit
back
and
enjoy
it
all
--
even
if
they
pretend
not
to
later

amazing
you
have
to
realize
this
is
one
of
the
best
movies
ever
made
.
i
personally
think
that
this
movie
is
fine
for
12
it
has
mild
kissing
and
it
does
have
a
topless
woman
posing
for
a
painting
but
that
scene
only
last
2-3
minutes
.
there
is
some
violence
and
some
language
.

the
