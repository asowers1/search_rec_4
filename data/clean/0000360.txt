a
marvelous
ability
to
render
the
absurd
familiar

mankind
can
harvest
vast
energy
from
the
basic
stuff
of
matter
using
means
that
only
people
with
considerable
higher
education
can
even
describe
accurately
.
but
nobodyâs
taken
aback
by
this
fact
because
welp
theyâve
been
doing
that

since
your
grandpaâs

.

i
digress

in
the

way
pink
floyd
â
one
of
the
most
popular
musical
groups
of
all
time
â
has
been
normalized
by
their
ubiquity
.
their
record
sales
figures
alone

the
mind
.
according
to
wikipedia
theyâve
sold
roughly
250
million
albums
.
the
human
brain
tends
to
gloss
over
numbers
of
that
size
when
theyâre
delivered
without
context
so
hereâs
some
.
in
1990
there
were
just
under
250
million
people
living
in
the
united
states
of
america
.
pink
floyd
has
effectively
sold
an
album
to
every
single
one
of
those
people
.
that
puts
them
ahead
of
celine
dion
acdc
the
rolling
stones
and
abba
among
others
.
only
the
beatles
elvis
michael
jackson
led
zeppelin
madonna
and
elton
john
have
done
better.â
and
that
figure
doesnât
include
all
of
the
people
whoâve
pirated
their
albums
or
who
never
bought
their
albums
but
have
heard
their
music
on
the
radio
for
decades
or
whoâve
lived
with
family
members
and
spouses
who
played
pink
floyd
in
their
homes
and
so
on
.
their
cultural
reach
is
epically
imperially
huge
.
and
that
reach
does
not
end
with
their
album
and
merchandise
sales
which
continue
to
pile
up
almost
20
years
after
their
demise
.
pink
floydâs
songs
have
been
covered
referenced
and
parodied
into
oblivion
.
planetarium
laser
shows
set
to
their
music
are
so
popular
that
theyâve
become
a
stoner
clichã
.
the
poster

painted
on
their

is
a
dorm-room
staple
rivaling

persistence
of

of
the

of

moon
held
onto
a
spot
in
the
reggae
charts
for
five
years
.
this
band
is
so
popular
and
has
been
for
so
long
that
itâs
basically
impossible
to
imagine
the
rockpop
landscape
without
them
.
theyâre
like
isaac
asimov
â
many
of
their
tropes
seem
hackneyed
now
but
thatâs
because
everyone
has
been
ripping
them
off
for
decades
.
and
yet
in
spite
of
their
impossible
sales
and
disarming
omnipresence
pink
floyd
might
be
the
most
unlikely
success
story
in
rock
history
â
an
extremely
dark
thoroughly
experimental
group
that
began
their
career
with
a
madman
at
the
helm
and
with
a
partially
media-devised
affinity
for
scary
underground
drugs
.
the
list
of
60s-era
pop
music
diktats
they
gleefully
violated
over
the
course
of
their
career
is
too
long
to
enumerate
but
hereâs
a
partial
version
â
do
not
write
25-minute
songs
.
â
do
not
devote
entire
albums
to
strange
formal
experiments
.
â
do
not
neglect
to
release
a
single
for
much
of
your
peak
creative
period
.
â
do
not
go
crazy
.
â
do
not
sing
about
going
crazy
.
â
do
not
bum
everyone
out
with
harsh
critiques
of
your
society
.
â
do
not
spit
on
your
fans
even
if
theyâre
being
rude
.
and
this
stuff
is
just
the
beginning
.
even
by
rock-god
standards
pink
floyd
were
sublimely
bizarre
both
as
an
artistic
entity
and
as
a
group
of
people
.
though
itâs
impossible
to
imagine
the
2013
rockpop
landscape
without
them
itâs
just
as
tough
to
imagine
an
equally
daring
group
blowing
up
today
.
so
how
did
pink
floyd
get
so
immensely
popular
some
of
their
success
can
be
traced
to
timing
and
serendipity
.
they
formed
in
1965
when
rockâs
frontiers
were
wild
and
unexplored
â
there
was
still
plenty
of
territory
for
them
to
pioneer
.
their
association
with
the
psychedelic
drug
scene
accidental
though
it
may
have
been
helped
make
them
a
youth-culture
buzz
band
.
chief
lyricistbassist
roger
watersâs
turn
towards
social
and
psychological
ruminations
in
the
1970s
resonated
with
the
widespread
societal
soul-searching
of
the
era
.
exogenous
market
forces
helped
as
well
of
course
.
music
culture
was
more
homogenized
back
then
and
people
still
bought
records
.
none
of
this
is
to
suggest
that
pink
floyd
succeeded
the
way
they
did
mostly
because
of
luck
or
timing
.
the
main
reason
that
pink
floyd
is
so
beloved
â
and
this
fact
sometimes
gets
lost
amidst
the
heaps
of
cultural
baggage
and
ephemera
that
surround
them
â
is
because
they
were
a
fucking
great
band
.
itâs
impossible
for
fans
to
even
describe
their
sound
without
spewing
breathless
superlatives
so
i
wonât
go
down
that
road
.
yet
.
after
all
you
already
know
what
pink
floyd
sounds
like
.
who
doesnât
this
week
the
entire
pink
floyd
catalog
was
made
available
on
streaming-music
service
spotify
so
its
an
apt
opportunity
for
us
to
cull
that
catalog
and
come
up
with
a
list
of
the
ten
best
pink
floyd
songs
.
uh
about
that
iâm
not
sure
these
are
the
ten
best
pink
floyd
songs
.
hell
iâm
not
even
sure
these
are
my
own
ten
favorite
pink
floyd
songs
.
this
band
released
14
albums
.
some
of
those
albums
focus
on
oddball
experimentation
â
atom
heart
mother
ummagumma
and
the
adapted
film
scores
more
and
obscured
by
clouds
.
some
of
them
came
out
during
transitional
or
waning
periods
in
the
bandâs
discography
â
saucerful
of
secrets
the
final
cut
a
momentary
lapse
of
reason
and
the
division
bell
.
these
albums
are
mostly
good
but
theyâre
outshone
by
the
towering
brilliance
of
the
remaining

animals
and

.
big
swathes
of
these
six
albums
deserve
to
be
included
.
to
make
matters
more
complicated
several
of
them
are
organized
into
unified
suites
that
donât
break
down
easily
.
i
considered
including
all
of
dark
side
and
the
wall
as
single
tunes
but
thatâd
be
a
cop-out
.
i
also
elected
not
to
unify
non-consecutive
suites
so
you
wonât
see
âshine
on
you
crazy
diamond
i-ixâ
or
âanother
brick

parts
1-3.â
ultimately
i
chose
the
entries
based
on
whether
iâd
be
able
to
forgive
myself
for
excluding
them
.
even
that
didnât
really
do
the
trick
but
in
the
face
of
deadlines
ugly
decisions
must
be
made
.
in
the
process
i
left
out
a
lot
of
choice
cuts
from
the

catalog

picks

âastronomy
domineâ
from
the
piper
at
the
gates
of
dawn
1967
even
46
years
after
the
release
of
âastronomy
domineâ
it
remains
one
of
the
oddest
tunes
ever
to
launch
the
recording
career
of
popular
rock
band
.
the
vocals
â
usually
the
focal
point
of
a
rock
song
especially
at
the
time
â
consist
of
guitarist
syd
barrett
and
keyboardist
richard
wright
chanting
nonsense
verse
about
space
which
is
weird
enough
on
its
own
.
their
surroundings
get
even
spookier
nick
masonâs
staggering
leadoff
fill
barrettâs
pinched-nerve
intro
riff
the
spiraling
chromatic
chorus
and
producer
norman
smithâs
encompassing
collage
of
astral
beeps
and
echo-effect
clatter
.
despite
being
the
only
pink
floyd
song
that
lyrically
deals
directly
with
space
âastronomy
domineâ
played
a
huge
role
in
launching
space
rock
which
remains
in
orbit
today
.
itâs
also
significant
because
itâs
the
most
succinct
expression
of
barrettâs
spectacular
but
short-lived
chemistry
with
floyd
.
the
drug-induced
breakdown
that
eventually
forced
him
from
the
band
would
color
their
workâs
emotional
character
for
the
remainder
of
their
run
.
9.
âechoesâ
from
meddle
1971
a
buddy
of
mine
used
to
play
a
fun
game
with
this
tune
.
when
he
was
in
college
heâd
go
to
the
local
watering
hole
which
had
a
copy
of
meddle
in
its
jukebox
.
heâd
pay
for
12
songs
the
first
of
which
was
always
the
24-minute
âechoes.â
the
bartender
would
become
agitated
as
soon
as
its
opening
chime
cut
through
the
air
.
the
playlist
would
then
return
to
a
normal
roster
of
boozy
bar
jams
until
it
reached
its
last
songâwhich
was
of
course
always
âechoes.â
this
isnât
pink
floydâs
longest
song
that
honor
goes
to
the
ungainly
but
beautiful
title
track
from
atom
heart
mother
.
it
is
however
their
first
wholly
successful
effort
at
writing
and
recording
a
side-length
multipart
epic
.
conceived
in
pieces
and
composed
collaboratively
by
the
entire
band
âechoesâ
cleared
the
path
for
the
ambitious
full-album
compositions
that
pink
floyd
would
crank
out
for
the
rest
of
the
decade
.
fittingly
âechoesâ
has
echoed
in
other
famous
musical
works
.
check
out
masonâs
robotically
crisp
snareclosed-hat
attack
starting
at
around
730
of
the
killer
live
at
pompeii
version
which
foreshadows
phil
selwayâs
drum
tone
on
radioheadâs
ok
computer
.
even
more
uncanny
is
the
similarity
between
the
songâs
instrumental
refrain
and
the
overture
from
andrew
lloyd
weberâs
1986
musical
the
phantom
of
the
opera
.
waters
elected
not
to
file
plagiarism
litigation
over
the
matter
because
as
he
put
it
âlifeâs
too
long
to
bother
with
suing
andrew
fucking
lloyd
weber.â
8.
âcomfortably
numbâ
from
the
wall
1979
the
wall
rightly
has
a
reputation
as
the
first
of
roger
watersâs
two
quasi-solo
albums
under
the
pink
floyd
name
.
ironically
one
of
its
best
cuts
involved
only
a
gentle
touch
from
his
creative
hand
.
âcomfortably
numbâ
is
mostly
a
david
gilmour
tune
waters
contributed
only
lyrics
and
a
snippet
of
chord
work
.
he
also
mumbles
dylan-style
through
the
verses
the
rest
of
the
vocals
are
all
gilmour
.
people
often
confuse
âcomfortably
numbâ
for
a
song
about
drug
addiction
but
watersâs
real
lyrical
inspiration
was
a
1977
incident
in
which
he
was
forced
to
soldier
through
a
lengthy
gig
in
philly
while
under
the
doctor-directed
influence
of
tranquilizers
.
the
real
story
on
this
tune
though
is
gilmourâs
two
legendary
guitar
solos
.
on
the
eve
of
the
80s
he
had
adopted
a
steely
lead
tone
that
foreshadowed
the
arena-metal
flash
of
the
decade
to
come
.
of
course
thereâs
no
self-indulgent
shredding
here
â
just
gilmourâs
pointillistic
precision
and
impeccable
phrasing
which
are
more
than
enough
to
set
this
drifting
song
ablaze
.
7.
âmoneyâ
from
the
dark
side
of
the
moon
1973
âmoneyâ
is
a
rite
of
passage
.
whenever
a
young
lad
or
lass
picks
up
a
bass
guitar
and
learns
the
ways
of
rock
ânâ
roll
rhythm
there
comes
a
time
when
he
or
she
must
grapple
with
the
challenge
of
odd
time
signatures
.
and
when
that
time
comes
the
bass
line
from
âmoneyâ
awaits
.
though
the
most
iconic
features
of
âmoneyâ
are
its
74
verse
rhythm
and
its
opening
tape
loop
everything
else
in
the
song
is
equally
great

âthe

from

1979
this
two-song
sequence
is
so
famous
and
popular
so
thoroughly
internalized
and
referenced
and
joked
around
with
and
bitched
about
that
itâs
almost
hard

itâs
more
of

cultural
artifact

heirloom

ironically
even
the
members

followed
through
on
his
original
desire
to
write
a
shorter

his
frustration
with

world
wouldâve
been
deprived
of
one
of

even
after
decades
of

critical
dissection

overexposure

remains
a
song
of
incredible
resonance

âpigs
three
different
onesâ
from
animals
1977
by
the
mid-70s
punk
rock
had
begun
to
take
hold
in
the
united
kingdom
.
psychedelic
drugs
were
out
huffing
glue
and
punching
cops
were
in
.
punk
musicians
and
fans
routinely
slammed
floyd
as
exemplars
of
contemporary
rockâs
dowdy
politics
and
sonic
flabbiness
.
these
criticisms
purportedly
influenced
floydâs
work
on
animals
.
you
wouldnât
know
it
by
the
music
itself
which
sounds
stark
but
sprawls
hard
â
roughly
39
of
its
42
minutes
are
spread
over
just
three
songs
.
it
also
gives
more
space
to
gilmourâs
ever-glorious
soloing
which
is
at
its
weirdest
on
âpigsâ
â
he
uses
a
talk
box
to
imitate
the
titular
animalâs
squeal
and
even
rips
some
fretless
bass
leads
while
waters
holds
down
the
rhythm
guitar
.
the
lyrics
on
animals
are
a
different
story
.
each
of
those
three
monster
tunes
compares
a
british
social
caste
to
an
animal
and
the
comparisons
are
not
flattering

the
emotional

crack-up
reverberates
through
much
of
pink
floydâs
catalog
but
only
âshine

addresses
him
directly

the
midst
of
the
songâs
mixing
process
is
one
of
the
saddest
and
most
poignant
anecdotes
in
all
of
rock
history
.
waters
who
considered
barrett
an
avatar
for
the
ravaging
effects
of
20th-century
society
on
the
human
soul
reputedly
broke
down
in
tears
.
floydâs
great
sorrow
over
barrettâs
fate
seeps
from
every
note
of
their
group-composed
tribute
to
him
.
waters
delivers
some
of
his
most
direct
and
heartfelt
lyrics
over
masonâs
68
sway
ânow
thereâs
a
look
in
your
eyes
like
black
holes
in
the
skyâcome
on
you
raver
you
seer
of
visions
come
on
you
painter
you
piper
you
prisoner
and
shineâ
wright
rarely
in
the
spotlight
opens
the
song
with
a
beautiful
synth
collage
and
supports
its
dramatic
climax
with
weeping
chordal
organs
.
and
the
gilmour
lead
that
starts
around
610
pretty
sure
thatâs
the
sound
of
manâs
soul
draining
away
.
3.
âbrain
damageeclipseâ
from
the
dark
side
of
the
moon
1973
these
two
songs
are
often
collectively
mistaken
for
the
title
track
from
dark
side
there
isnât
one
â
âbrain
damageâ
uses
the
title
as
its
chorus
and
runs
seamlessly
into
the
finale
âeclipse.ââ
together
they
provide
the
emotional
zenith
to
one
of
the
most
seamlessly
constructed
albums
of
all
time
and
what
a
zenith
it
is
.
itâs
basically
impossible
to
address
the
emotional
impact
of
âbrain
damageeclipseâ
without
discussing
about
the
album
as
a
whole
so
instead
iâll
say
this
engineer
alan
parsons
yes
that
one
achieved
one
of
the
great
production
feats
of
the
analog
era
with
these
two
tunes
.
the
balance
between
spare
nervous
verse
and
lush
organ-and-choir-driven
chorus
on
âbrain
damageâ
perfectly
matches
the
lyrics
which
see
waters
agonize
over
his
psychological
similarity
to
his
crazy
ex-bandmate
â
âand
if
your
head
explodes
with
dark
forebodings
too
iâll
see
you
on
the
dark
side
of
the
moon.â
and
the
way
that
the
stately
all-encompassing
swing
of
âeclipseâ
collapses
with
signature
pink
floyd
circularity
into
the
heartbeat
that
opens
the
albumâyeah
you
can
start
to
understand
why
this
peculiar
little
record
has
sold
well
.
2.
âdogsâ
from
animals
1977
this
song
holds
a
special
place
in
my
heart
.
the
first
time
i
heard
it
was
the
17-minute-long
moment
at
which
i
realized
that
pink
floyd
was
no
dinosaur
hippie
group
but
a
musical
and
emotional
powerhouse
that
will
probably
never
stop
being
relevant
as
long
as
western
civilization
remains
a
scary
tragic
place
.
like
the
other
big
tracks
on
animals
âdogsâ
compares
humanity
to
its
eponymous
beast
.
it
boasts
the
most
incisive
and
affecting
lyrics
of
the
three
though
a
brutal
examination
of
a
conniving
businessmanâs
flaws
and
weaknesses
.
the
final
verse
summarizes
its
subjectâs
lifetime
of
abjection
with
such
devastating
precision
that
itâs
tough
to
listen
to
.
only
âshine
on
you
crazy
diamondâ
matches
it
for
sheer
intensity
.
âdogsâ
also
marks
the
career
high-water
mark
for
david
gilmourâs
lead
playing
.
since
gilmour
occupies
a
high
seat
in
the
rock-soloist
canon
âdogsâ
has
a
considerable
claim
to
the
title
of
best
guitar
song
ever
.
got
a
better
pick
letâs
hear
it
.
his
playing
on
this
song
channels
so
much
heart
through
such
economical
phrasing
thatâwell
here
come
the
superlatives
.
just
listen
.
1.
âwish
you
were
hereâ
from
wish
you
were
here
1975
letâs
be
straight
every
song
on
this
list
couldâve
landed
in
the
top
slot
.
i
chose
âwish
you
were
hereâ
because
itâs
the
strongest
distillation
of
the
traits
that
made
this
band
great
.
for
all
of
pink
floydâs
relentless
progressivism
â
the
superhuge
songs
the
rock
operas
the
musique
concrãte
influence
the
zany
stagecraft
â
they
would
have
never
have
achieved
so
much
if
they
werenât
able
to
reign
the
weirdness
in
and
write
pristine
songs
.
âthey
write
great
songsâ
is
maybe
the
worst
rock-writer
clichã
but
for
pink
floyd
itâs
inescapably
true
.
and
this
one
wasnât
even
a
single
âwish
you
were
hereâ
finds
all
of
floydâs
finest
attributes
present
and
in
perfect
balance
sophisticated
studio
trickery
gorgeous
instrumental
textures
a
timeless
chord
progression
restrained-but-powerful
leads
from
gilmour
and
wright
a
syd
barrett
nod
the
âcold
steel
railâ
line
refers
to
a
barrett
lyric
from
the
madcap
laughs
and
a
refrain
that
will
lodge
in
your
braincase
the
first
time
you
hear
it
and
stay
there
for
the
rest
of
your
life
.
it
manages
this
crazy
achievement
in
just
five
minute
and
thirty-four
seconds
.
and
it
organizes
the
whole
affair
around
the
emotion
that
defines
pink
floydâs
best
work
an
aching
cosmic
loneliness
that
every
living
person
has
felt
at
one
time
or
another
.
and
that
is
why
this
weird-ass
band
has
sold
250
million
records
.

know

be
tough
to

a

for
pink
floyd
songs
since
there
are
so
many
great
songs
.
but
ill
be
damned
if
you
didnt
pick
out
the
strongest
highlights
from
their
best
albums
.
even
managing
to
include
the
timeless
classics
.
you
got
echoes
and
shine
on
you
crazy

in
the
list

this

really

with

good
point
.
it
really
is
amazing
how
good
their
catalog
is
despite
how
jaded
weve
become
towards
it
.
its
hard
for
me
to
listen
to
and
appreciate
a
lot
of
these
songs
only
because
classic
rock
radio
has
destroyed
any
sense
of
novelty
they
once
had
.
yet
if
you
can
actually
sit
down
and
listen
to
dark
side
of
the
moon
without
any
premonition
it
becomes
mind-blowing
how
genius
that
album
truly
is

one
of
the
reasons
that

is
because
i
grew
up

almost
no

jim
rountree
allow
me
to
explain
this
list
was
a
beast
i
applaud
you
for
trying
.
but
do
you
really
consider
some
of
these
songs
their
absolute
best
i
know
in
the
article
you
wrote
these
may
not
even
be
my
picks
for
the
best
pink
floyd
songs
and
yet
the
ones
you
picked
are
the
ones
that
everyone
is
uber-familiar
with
.
you
cant
possibly
put
another
brick
part
2
seriously
as
one
of
their
best
even
from
that
album
.
95
of
the
songs
on
that
list
are
being
played
on
classic
rock
stations
as
we
speak
and
you
culled
your
list
from
basically
four
albums
from
a
band
whove
put
out
almost
20.
dont
get
me
wrong
i
think
a
list
of
this
undertaking
is
hard
and
nobody
is
going
to
please
everybody
but
this
list
is
fairly
safe
.
wish
you
were
here
another
brick
part
2
comfortably
numb
money
i
mean
you
got
ta
admit
the
list
is
really
classic
rocks
radio-y
.
theres
no
fucking
way
money
goes
on
there
but
us
and
them
doesnt
.
theres
no
way
comfortably
numb
goes
on
there
but
fearless
doesnt
.
or
one
of
these
days
.
or
mother
.
also
this
was
mentioned
somewhere
else
on
the
list
but
nothing
from
obscured
by
clouds
or
really
anything
with
syd
barrett
nothing
from
atom
heart
mother
fat
old
sun
is
one
of
the
best
guitar
parts
david
gilmoure
ever
wrote
.
im
glad
echoes
and
shine
on
made
the
list
but
come
on
those
are
really
easy
calls
too
.
echoes
simply
for
the
sheer
bombasity
of
it
.
if
you
want
to
shake
the
classic
rock
radioness
off
of
it
there
are
tons
of
other
calls
that
could
have
gone
on
here
but
another
brick
in
the
wall
part
2
a
song
that
deaf
people
could
sing
in
their
sleep
thanks
to
it
being
overplayed
got
put
on
there
.
im
really
not
trying
to
insult
you
or
anything
i
think
dogs
echoes
astronomy
even
wish
you
were
here
and
shine
those
are
great
songs
and
deserve
consideration
and
placement
but
money
that
album
is
incredible
and
you
picked
the
one
song
on
there
that
does
not
need
to
anywhere
near
a
best
of
pink
floyd
list
especially
considering
the
very
next
song
is
the
best
song
on
that
album
.
anyway
sorry
i
quit
smoking
two
days
ago
and
thats
the
reason
i
wrote
all
this
shit
out
like
that
.
its
like
there
are
dogs
barking
and
im
the
only
one
that
can
hear
them
.
ive
been
eating
like
a
horse
and
i
dont
know
what
to
do
with
my
hands
anymore

jim
rountree
okay
well
let
me
explain
what
i
mean
.
first
i
applaud
you
for
making
this
list
its
a
toughy
and
i
recognize
there
is
no
way
youd
be
able
to
please
everyone
all
the
time
with
it
.
its
fucking
impossible
.
so
im
not
going
to
criticize
the
list
for
that
.
but
come
on
some
of
these
picks
are
straight
out
of
the
rotation
of
tampas
classic
rock
lunch
hour
.
another
brick
part
2
money
you
said
yourself
that
you
dont
even
know
if
this
is
really
your
favorites
list
but
look
at
what
you
decided
to
go
with
.
90
of
it
can
be
heard
in
regular
rotation
on
the
radio
.
you
cant
tell
me
another
brick
in
the
wall
part
2
deserves
to
be
on
that
list
while
fearless
a
far
superior
song
to
virtually
every
song
on
here
is
left
off
.
money
is
on
there
but
the
next
song
on
dark
side
easily
the
best
song
on
that
album
us
and
them
doesnt
make
the
cut
.
comfortably
numb
while
good
any
number
of
songs
off
of
the
wall
would
be
better
picks
mother
goodbye
blue
sky
run
like
hell
etc
.
none
of
the
songs
you
picked
are
bad
but
they
cover
the
same
ground
that
lazy
classic
rock
computers
pick
out
every
day
and
they
cover
the
same
four
albums
starting
from
dark
side
and
ending
with
the
wall
.
this
is
one
era
out
of
many
that
they
had
and
its
the
one
everyone
knows
to
death
.
even
picking
echoes
and
shine
on
two
powerhouse
songs
that
i
agree
with
is
fairly
predictable
.
echoes
of
course
would
go
on
there
simply
because
of
its
sheer
bombastity
.
fearless
one
of
these
days
careful
with
that
axe
eugene
stay
childhoods
end
the
nile
song
mother
us
and
them
brain
damage
welcome
to
the
machine
a
song
so
stunning
and
utterly
full
of
bile
that
i
sometimes
cant
believe
they
got
it
onto
the
album
all
of
these
have
places
over
the
songs
selected
.
or
not
but
at
least
theyre
not
on
the
radio
.
also
look
.
i
quite
smoking
two
days
ago
and
this
shit
sucks
.
i
dont
know
what
to
do
with
my
hands
at
all
and
im
eating
like
a
horse
.
nothing
is
safe
im
one
step
away
from
pouring
garlic
powder
down
my
throat
.
this
is
awful

homesickalien
you
almost
have
a
great
list
here
.
its
not
fair
to
pick
top
songs
with
this
band
.
they
base
their
existence
on
concept
and
maybe
one
song
separated
from
an
album
is
fun
to
ponder
but
taken
as
whole
is
the
only
way
to
realistically
go
here
.
i
think
its
only
practical
to
include
arnold
layne
i
mean
its
sorta
what
got
everyones
attention
.
or
see
emily
play
.
astronomy
is
surely
the
sexy
pick
here
but
we
need
to
acknowledge
a
songs
place
in
their
popularity
.
i
mean
we
all
love
dig
a
pony
but
twist
and
shout
put
the
beatles
on
the
map
right
if
from
atom
heart
mother
would
be
another
great
early
pick
.
then
again
the
fact
that
nothing
from
ummagumma
is
represented
here
is
a
travesty
.
although
technically
the
final
cut
was
more
or
less
a
roger
waters
album
still
songs
like
gunners
dream
the
final
cut
and
not
now
john
are
some
of
the
best
examples
of
gilmores
guitar
and
waters
emotional
songwriting
working
in
an
incredible
collaborate
effort
.
they
despised
each
other
at
this
point
in
their
careers
and
the
pain
drips
off
each
track
.
echoes
is
an
obvious
great
choice
but
to
not
mention
one
of
these
days
is
a
travesty
.
i
often
think
there
is
great
similarity
between
that
and
radioheads
national
anthem
for
some
reason
.
pigs
dogs
are
great
but
sheep
is
as
good
or
better
.
impossible
to
rank
these
apart
.
animals
as
an
album
should
maybe
be
treated
as
just
one
long
song
.
christ
pigs
on
a
wing
alone
is
2
minutes
of
sheer
perfection
.
the
wall
oh
the
wallwhere
to
begin
here
.
first
having
abitw
pt2
and
numb
the
pick
from
here
is
good
obviously
but
not
its
best
representation
.
mother
hey
you
run
like
hell
and
on
and
on
and
on
us
and
them
not
included
is
a
bit
disturbing
.
also
time
includes
one
of
gilmores
most
underrated
guitar
solos
.
from
wish
you
were
here
i
can
not
accept
the
non
mention
of
welcome
to
the
machine
.
so
dark
and
broodingso
many
songs
have
followed
the
formula
used
in
this
song
.
wont
even
bring
the
argument
of
have
a
cigar
to
the
table
and
its
rock
star
finger
pointing
.
one
thing
that
i
think
should
also
be
awarded
is
the
post
break
up
pink
floyd
only
because
the
name
is
still
intact
so
the
next
chapter
should
be
awarded
.
i
know
there
is
great
argument
in
the
fact
that
pink
floyd
can
only
be
what
waters
and
gilmore
created
together
but
the
time
of
momentary
lapse
of
reason
could
have
been
an
abrupt
end
to
this
incredible
band
but
they
survived
it
and
songs
like
the
dogs
of
war
and
sorrow
still
carried
the
overall
energy
of
the
band
regardless
of
who
was
or
wasnt
there
.
the
same
could
be
said
with
waters
and
his
pros
and
cons
and
radio
kaos
days
but
we
all
remember
the
war
over
their
band
name
at
the
time
so
i
spose
we
must
accept
that
.
im
sure
this
was
a
hard
one
for
you
doug
and
so
respect
your
efforts
here
but
the
only
true
way
you
could
fire
off
a
pink
floyd
list
would
be
by
album
.

pretty
nice
list
.
i
agree
with
many
of
the
choices
but
think
there
should
have
been
one
or
two
more
barrett-era
tracks
see
emily
play
being
the
most
obvious
.
however
astronomy
domine
is
an
amazing
recording
and
definitely
a
great
pick
.

bryan

i
likewise
would
like
to
push
the
love
for
fearless
.
its
hard
to
argue
against
any
of
the
tracks
youve
included
but
i
would
say
you
unfairly
relegate
obscured
by
clouds
to
second-tier
album
status
.
that
one
perfectly
captures
the
moment
between
meddle
and
dark
side
and
is
full
of
classics
and
free
four
.
but
im
posting
here
to
contend
with
your
assertion
that
dogs
is
the
best
guitar
solo
.
i
would
argue
that
the
economic
soloing
on
wish
you
were
here
or
the
soaring
flights
on
comfortably
numb
are
better
within
the
floyd
catalog
.
however
best
solo
is
from
one
of
two
songs
in
my
book
either
fripps
blissfully
breaking
robotics
on
st.
elmos
fire
by
eno
or
more
probably
tom
verlaine
painting
a
sunrise
with
six
strings
on
marquee
moon
.
the
solo
they
captured
on
marquee
moon
is
nothing
short
of
pure
joy
.

great
list
.
personally
id
switch
out
some
of
those
dark
side
and
the
wall
segments
for
others
but
astronomy
domine
echoes
dogs
pigs
comfortably
numb
shine
on
i-v
and
wish
you
were
here
are
unimpeachable
picks
.
throw
in
sheep
us
them
and
goodbye
blue

and
that
would
be
my
list
.
although

john

great
job
on
a
very
serious
undertaking
.
it
reminded
me
that
time
hasnt
softened
pink
floyds
impact
on
my
life
nor
will
i
allow
their
music
to
be
saturated
by
classic
rock
radio
.
even
after
i
had
been
blown
away
years
before
the
first
time
i
listened
to
dark
side
i
was
rocked
just
as
hard
by
animals
and
some
of
their
more
obscure
avant
garde
works
.
sometimes
you
just
have
to
submit
to
the
fact
that
classics
are
still
classics
no
matter
how
many
times
weve
heard
them
.
by
the
way
not
too
many
classic
rock
stations
play
dogs
a
tune
that
i
think
rightfully
deserved
to
be
high
on
this
list
.

great
list
but
lets
be
honest
you
could
probably
chose
ten
other
pf
songs
and
make
another
list
just
as
compelling
.
one
of
these
days
should
have
been
on
this
list
though
.
in
fact
its
sole
lyric
one
of
these
days
im
going
to
cut
you
into
little
pieces
is
on
my
short
list
of
greatest
lyrics
ever
right
below
jcs
i
shot
a
man
in

just
to

him

also
i
would

domine
at
the

rather
than
at

i
am
probably
the
biggest
floyd
head
on
the
planet
.
this
is
not
an
easy
task
to
undertake
however
i
think
you
did
a
great
job
and
i
like
your
descriptions
for
the
most
part
.
while
my
ten
are
not
necessarily
the
ten
listed
i
think
this
still
accurately
describes
the
bulk
of
their
work
in
a
nutshell
but
we
know
you
cant
fit
pink
floyd
into
a
nutshell
.
while
some
classic
rock
snobs
might
argue
what
is
best
worst
that
is
just
conjecture
.
the
only
thing
i
would
like
to
have
read
is
more
mention
of
rick
wrights
work
on
animals
even
though
he
doesnt
get
writing
credit
.
while
gilmores
talk
box
work
is
some
of
the
best
example
of
that
medium
animals
is
the
album
where
wrights
keyboard
work
shines
from
nice
rhodes
intros
to
waters
voice
cross
fading
into
minimoog
madness
.
nice
work
i
was
skeptical
at
the
beginning
but
im
glad
i
read
through
till
the
end
