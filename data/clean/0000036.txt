to

it
is

that
they
are
all
about

to
be

them

the
necessary

politeness
and
overt

even
in

all

``
the
story
is
captivating
and
very
smart
and
the
ending
had
me
baffled
for
a
bit
the
first
time

read
it

it
has
a

resolution
despite

to
have

hide
spoiler
.
it
's
an
enjoyable
read
to
say
the
least
.
but
what
made
me
unsettled
both
of
the
times
i
read
it
was
the
nagging
question
of
justice
as
i
mentioned
above
.
yes
on
one
hand
it
's
almost
poetic
justice
to
punish
the
criminals
who
thought
they
got
away
with
it
.
on
the
other
hand
is
eye-for-an-eye
the
best
way
to
get
even
and
who
's
to
judge
anyway
who
is
either
conceited
enough
or
deranged
enough
to
assume
that
he
has
the
right
and
the
moral
authority
to
determine
guilt
and
the
extent
of
punishment
just
like
thatdo
n't
get
me
wrong
-
the
people
accused
on
the
island
are
undeniably
guilty
even
though
it
's
not
necessarily
murder
as
we
think
of
for
some
of
them
-
vera
claythorne
is
really
guilty
of
neglect
albeit
with
a
desire
to
kill
and
emily
brent
is
pretty
much
guilty
of
being
a
judgmental
ã¼ber-righteous
heartless
prude
.
but
the
degree
of
their
guilt
varies
quite
significantly
in
my
perception
and
it
does
not
always
coincide
with
what
their
'unknown
'
judgeexecutioner
thinks
running
two
children
over
with
a
car
and
feeling
no
remorse
is
to
me
worse
than
firing
a
pregnant
servant
who
then
goes
on
to
kill
herself
for
instance
.
and
is
arbitrarily
and
single-handedly
determining
their
guilt
and
doling
out
punishments
not
just
as
much
or
even
much
worse
or
a
crime
than
they
have
committed
conceited
self-righteous
crime
decide
for
yourself
.
speaking
of
guilt
-
this
novel
has
quite
a
bit
to
say
on
this
subject
.
you
see
many
of
the
characters
have
already
been
judged
and
condemned
by
their
own
selves
.
vera
claythorne
and
general
macarthur
both
are
tormented
by
their
guilt
and
view
spoilervera
actually
becomes
a
direct
victim
of
it
after
all
becoming
her
own
executioner
in
the
rather
creepy
and
effective
scene
hide
spoiler
.
interestingly
others
no
less
guilty
are
not
tormented
by
their
conscience
at
all
.
but
ultimately
this
does
not
matter
at
all
for
their
survival
only
the
fact
that
they
were
deemed
guilty
view
spoilerexcept
for
vera
as
i
mentioned
above
.
remorseless
philip
lombard
would
not
have
cracked
like
she
did
had
he
been
the
one
holding
the
revolver
a
few
minutes
earlier
hide
spoiler
.
so
should
being
tormented
by
guilt
versus
a
cold-blooded
killer
factor
at
all
in
the
administration
of
justicethese
are
the
thoughts
that
kept
running
through
my
head
as
i
was
reading
this
excellent
non-traditional
critically-acclaimed
specimen
of
mystery
literature
.
and
therefore
bravo
to
miss
christie
for
making
me
think
and
care
-
and
not
just
mindlessly
flipping
pages
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
whodunit
.
because
'who
'
was
much
less
important
to
me
than
'how
'
and
'why
'
-
especially
'why
'
.
for
all
of
this
i
give
it
the
unflinching
guilt-free

is
a
fortunate
choice
of
words
for
the
title
so
it
was
changed
to
'and
then
there
were
none
'
-
the
last
line
of
the
nursery
rhyme
which
in
this
new
version
was
called
'ten
boy
soldiers'.this
is
the
version
that
i
read
and
i
must
say
i
am
glad
.
i
think
i
would
be
rather
uncomfortable
reading
something
called
'the
little
niggers
'
which
takes
place
on
'nigger
island
'
how
did
christie
want
to
pull
this
off
'nigger
island
'
off
the
devon
coast
really
how.the
premise
i
am
sure
you
know
is
this
ten
people
end
up
cut
off
from
the
world
on
a
tiny
island
.
one
of
them
is
a
murderer
and
people
keep
dying
as
in
the
nursery
rhyme
.
every
person
on
the
island
has
a
secret
and
is
guilty
of
a
murder
.
it
's
the
kind
of
murder
where
law
is
helpless
.
nothing
can
be
proven
.
this
is
why
they
found
themselves
on
that
island
at
the
mercy
of
a
prototype
'jigsaw
'
madman
who
decided
justice
must
be
done.the
premise
requires
the
structure
of
the
novel
to
be
very
organised
and
clean
cut
.
i
felt
that
it
was
only
right
for
me
to
approach
the
reading
of
it
in
an
equally
disciplined
way
.
i
took
five
sheets
of
papers
and
divide
each
in
half
thus
ending
up
with
ten
cards
one
for
each
character.and
i
continued
to
dilligently
fill
them
out
with
all
the
details
i
learnt
about
the
characters
until
about
halfway
through
the
book
when
i
became
too
engrossed
frightened
and
nervous
.
i
already
had
an
inkling
as
to
who
the
murderer
was
and
was
petrified
i
would
be
murdered
in
my
sleep
as
well
.
the
situation
was
very
serious
and
i
had
to
invite
all
my
teddy
bears
back
to
my
bed
so
they
could
protect
me.i
grew
to
like
two
of
the
characters
-
the
sentiment
i
think
i
shared
with
christie
as
she
liked
them
so
she
killed
them
last.this
was
my
second
christie
and
the
first
proper
one
.
the
first
one
i
read
was
a
bit
of
a
mishap
spy
novel
so
christie
's
brilliance
was
n't
as
apparent
as
it
was
in
'and
then
there
were
none
'
.

'gay
'
for
example
meant
happy
now
it
means
something
else

i
'm
sure
the

word
did
n't
have
the
same
connotation
at
the
time

i
ca
n't
see
anyone
writing
a
poem
or
a
book
specially
someone
like
christie
using
offensive
words
.
knowing
this
though

i
do
n't
know
how
i
feel
about
the
censoring

i
agree
it
would
not
play
well
nowadays
but
there
could
be
like
a
note

was
titled
ten

only
because
the
original
nursery
rhyme
was
called

but
it
was
obviously
seen
as

then
in
usa
was
decided
to
change
the
title
to
ten
little
indians
but
again
obviously
as
seen
as
racist
again
so
at
the
end
the
title
was
changed
to
and
there
were
none
and
the
nursery
rhyme
inside
the
book
was
changed
to
``
ten
little
soldiers
''
curiously
enough
none
member
of
any
army
so
far
as
pointed
out
as
racist
that
final
change
.
i
mean
the
title
was
just
because
a
widely
known
nursery
rhyme
and
none
character
on
the
book
was
afro-american
or
native-american
.
to
this
i
want
to
comment
that
it
's
lucky
that
not
many
children
would
had
more
nightmares
since
a
lot
of
nursery
rhymes
have
truly
scary
lyrics
.
no
wonder
in
stuff
like
a
nightmare
on
elm
street
and
saphire
and
steel
were
used
nursery
rhymes
with
truly
scary
effects.returning
to
the
novel
it
was
a
remarkable
reading
.
great
atmosphere
where
you
feel
as
trapped
as
those
people
on
that
island.i
want
to
comment
that
at
some
point
i
figured
it
out
who
was
the
murderer
do
n't
worry
i
wo
n't
tell
it
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
some
would
say
``
oh
sure
i
believe
you
sherlock
''
.
however
i
do
indeed
discovered
it
.
this
is
not
my
first
mystery
story
.
i
have
read
several
books
in
the
genre
and
i
have
watched
a
lot
of
tv
shows
like
murder
she
wrote
columbo
criminal
minds
csi
miami
etc
...
and
while
that
does
n't
turn
me
into
a
detective
in
my
defense
i
knew
who
was
only
because
i
focused
on
the
``
why
''
and
not
the
``
how
''
that
certainly
i
did
n't
know
that
.
you
can
say
that
i
did
an
amateur
criminal
profile
and
that
helped
me
to
have
a
suspect
of
my
own
that
it
resulted
true
.
also
i
had
some
advantage
for
being
spanish
speaking
since
there
is
a
clue
that
only
can
be
detected
due
that
not
matter
that
i
read
the
novel
on
english
but
taking
in
account
the
very
detail
that
it
's
indeed
a
printed
novel
i
catched
something
and
putting
together
some
clues
.
well
i
figured
it
out
.
believe
or
not
.
it
does
n't
matter.anyway
i
think
that
many
of
the
fun
of
reading
this
kind
of
mystery
novels
is
trying
to
figure
out
the
culprit
during
the
process
of
reading
the
book
.
not
matter
if
you
guess
right
or
not
always
it
's
rewarding
when
the
mystery
is
explained
.
a
delicious
way
to
make
your
neurons
to
exercise.again
knowing
who
was
or
at
least
thinking
that
i
knew
who
was
since
obviously
i
could
n't
confirm
it
until
reading
the
whole
book
it
did
n't
help
me
to
know
how
everything
was
made
until
it
was
explained
on
the
novel
.
definitely
agatha
christie
is
the
queen
of
mysterycertainly
this
novel
is
n't
only
a
marvellous
detective
mystery
book
but
also
a
truly
scary
horror
story
.
priceless

for

appendix
july
23rd
2014
the
clue
that
i
found
thanks
that
i
am
a
born
spanish-language
speakerwarning
warning
warning
warningread
only
if
you
already
read
the
novel
since
this
is
a
mega-spoiler
telling
who
the
culprit
isi
seldom
put
spoilers
in
my
reviews
but
i
wrote
this
appendix
basically
since
i
was
contacted
by
several
readers
asking
me
about
the
``
big
clue
''
and
well
while
i
do
n't
mind
to
share
it
well
also
i
do
n't
want
to
find
out
later
that
it
was
written
down
in
some
other
review
as
theirs
taking
in
account
that
it
seems
that
only
me
were
the
one
who
noticed
that.view
spoilerok
the
big
fuzz
about
the
clue
that
i
found
is
that
the
first
character
that
you
find
in
the
novel
is
mr.
justice
wargrave
on
the
chapter
one
you
may
say
``
so
what
''
well
the
mysterious
couple
who
invited
to
all
guests
the
initials
of
both
names
of
them
are
u.n.o
.
in
the
imaginary
woman
is
``
una
nancy
owen
''
and
the
supposed
husband
is
``
u.n.
owen
.
u.n.o
.
that
in
spanish
can
be
spelled
just
like
``
uno
''
which
means
``
one
''
on
english
.
maybe
that
a
coincidence
but
with
agatha
christie
nothing
can
be
left
to
chance
so
i
think
that
may
be
a
clue
targeted
to
the
readers
with
knowledge
about
spanish
language
.

those
endless
tv
adaptations
with
the
dotty
miss
marple
and
dorky
poirot
did
n't
help
either
.
i
had
her
books
written
off
-
predictable
-
cozy
-
tricksy
-
unreal
-
feminine
.
i
liked
patricia
cornwell
and
noir
.
show
me
a
grisly
procedural
and
i
'll
sink
into
it
like
a
warm
bath.the
result
of
this
prejudice
of
course
was
that
i
never
saw
what
was
actually
there
and
only
cheated
myself
.
but
matters
were
n't
helped
when
i
took
a
delightful
genre
studies
course
in
graduate
school
the
singing
sands
ashenden
knight
's
gambit
an
unsuitable
job
for
a
woman
poe
doyle
...
.
and
we
had
to
read
the
murder
of
roger
ackroyd
about
whom
legendary
snob
edmund
wilson
famously
asked
who
cares
not
me
.
not
that
i
cared
for
wilson
either
.
i
hated
that
book.but
during
that
course
i
ran
across
something
interesting
.
for
my
final
topic
i
chose
the
work
of
p.d
.
james
and
read
all
of
her
books
published
up
til
then
-
through
original
sin
-
in
about
a
month
dizzying
but
v
fun
and
you
could
n't
miss
emblazoned
on
all
her
paperbacks
at
the
time
the
new
queen
of
crime
she
usurps
christie
's
throne
cagematch
between
phyllis
and
agatha
two
bitches
enter
one
novelist
leaves
c
c
you
get
the
picture
.
this
was
mainly
very
stupid
marketing
because
james
and
christie
have
almost
nothing
in
common
even
tho
james
's
first
derivative
novel
had
the
classic
locked-room
scenario
.
but
i
read
a
lot
of
interviews
with
james
and
while
she
was
polite
about
christie
well
she
's
british
i
sensed
something
else
respect
.
apparently
her
tone
's
changed
a
bit
in
her
most
recent
nonfiction
book
about
mysteries
but
then
she
said
something
like
'she
is
a
conjurer
with
those
cards
and
each
time
you
think
you
know
which
one
she
is
turning
face-up
and
each
time
you
are
wrong
.
'
well
now
that
was
interesting
.
every
time
and
i
discovered
the
answer
is
yes
pretty
much
.
call
it
a
trick
call
it
a
gimmick
call
it
masterful
puzzle-plotting
call
it
a
kind
of
genius
whatever
it
is
it
's
frighteningly
consistent
.
it
is
what
stephen
king
terms
the
'
got
ta
'
in
misery
raised
almost
to
an
art
form
.
it
is
what
magnus
eisengrim
describes
in
robertson
davies
'
world
of
wonders
as
what
makes
a
great
magician
'a
man
who
can
stand
stark
naked
in
the
middle
of
a
crowd
and
keep
it
gaping
for
an
hour
while
he
manipulates
a
few
coins
or
cards
or
billiard
balls
.
'this
would
have
been
a
far
far
better
book
for
me
to
read
in
that
class
that
was
almost
fifteen
years
ago
now
gosh
.
for
one
thing
it
has
a
sharp
strong
original
female
central
character
she
's
not
quite
a
heroine
its
gimmick
is
equally
as
good
as
ackroyd
's
and
it
is
a
dazzling
distinctive
example
of
the
one-of-us-is-a-murderer-but-which-one
plot
.
even
better
there
is
no
trace
of
that
horrific
socratic
bore
hercule
poirot
or
any
of
his
little
grey
cells
.
for
all
that
critics
harp
on
christie
's
cardboard
characters
and
outlandish
setups
this
book
depends
largely
on
characterization
and
atmosphere
.
each
of
the
ten
people
brought
to
a
deserted
barren
island
is
guilty
to
a
greater
or
lesser
degree
of
causing
the
death
of
another
person
and
the
book
becomes
almost
a
meditation
on
-
what
is
guilt
what
is
responsibility
the
murderer
is
n't
just
randomly
cutting
people
down
but
manipulating
them
and
enjoying
it
.
even
if
they
are
all
as
guilty
as
she
or
he
thinks
they
are
do
they
deserve
to
be
picked
off
and
psychologically
tortured
what
justifies
passing
sentence
on
someone
else
these
are
not
easy
questions
and
christie
does
not
give
easy
answers.also
trying
to
write
a
spoiler-free
review
of
this
is
hard
yeesh
.

and
quite
amusingly
reminds
me
of
that
old
american
murder
mystery
in
sunset
beach
.
basically
they
're
the
only
ones
on
this
island
and
someone
is
killing
them
off
one
by
one
in
accordance
with
the
ten
little
indians
rhyme
.
and
i
swear
i
never
saw
it
coming
and
i
'm
usually
very
good
at
it
.
it
's
just
a
very
clever
novel
full
of
mystery
and
suspense
and
easily
quite
frightening
at
times.i
like
how
agatha
christie
does
n't
have
to
write
a
500
page
novel
with
a
massive
back
story
her
mysteries
are
very
simply
put
together
but
always
clever
and
hard
to
decipher
.
i
would
recommend
this
book
to
everyone
.

i
got
the
same
feeling
about
this
book
this
was
one
of
christi

was

i
felt
like
the

almost
too
obvious
that
you

see
it

the
way
christie
set
the
mood
in
the
book
you
could
expect
the
storm
and
the
loss
of
power
to
trap
the
guests
on
the
island
.
murphy
's
law
was
on
the
side
of
the
killer
.
after
reading
i
wonder
if
there
was
a
way
for
any
of
the
guests
to
break
the
rhyme
and
catch
the
killer
.
they
did
see
the
rhyme
why
not
try
to
follow
it
and
avoid
all
of
the
clues
in
it
i
also
thought
it
was
like
the
sixth
sense
you
almost
could
say
the
ending
but
you
needed
to
know
who
did
it
.
overall
this
was
a
great
book
and
i
too
recommend
it

so
i
agree
with
you
because
the
second

does
n't
have
the
same
feel
as
the
first

i
enjoyed
your
moral

i
think
it
could

the
most
suspenseful
parts
of
the

was
when
someone
was
unexpectedly
killed

``
fun
fact
this
was
originally
published
as
ten
little
niggers
then
ten
little
indians
before
finally
settling
on
the
offensive-to-no-one
we
hope
and
then
there
were
none
.
proving
of
course
that
a
christie
's
publishers
probably
know
what
they
're
doing
and
b
a
story
can
be
great
enough
to
completely
eclipse
its
unsavory
past
.
this
is
a
good
mystery
.
this
is
a
really
good
mystery
particularly
to
people
who
are
already
familiar
with
agatha
christie
's
work
because
it
's
like
no
other
christie
mystery
i
've
read
so
far
.
there
's
no
official
detective
investigating
the
case
from
an
impersonal
distance
so
those
sick
of
poirot
's
smarmy
lectures
about
his
stupid
little
gray
cells
or
frustrated
by
miss
marple
's
lack
of
direct
involvement
in
her
own
cases
will
have
much
to
be
thankful
for
here
and
although
the
agatha
christie
players
are
still
here
the
young
governess
the
old
military
man
the
cocky
playboy
the
old
spinster
they
all
have
a
dark
edge
to
them
that
has
n't
been
seen
in
other
christie
books
.
because
of
course
the
ten
main
characters
in
this
mystery
have
all
committed
murder
at
some
point
in
their
lives
.
some
of
the
deaths
were
accidental
others
were
deliberate
but
they
all
have
something
in
common
each
murder
occurred
in
such
a
way
that
it
ca
n't
be
proven
in
a
legal
setting
and
each
death
is
the
reason
these
ten
people
are
brought
to
soldier
island
by
a
mysterious
guest
.
and
then
they
start
getting
killed
off
one
by
one
and
it
's
suspenseful
and
creepy
and
everything
that
the
saw
movies
are
n't
even
smart
enough
to
try
imitating
.
admittedly
i
guessed
a
couple
of
the
plot
twists
but
only
in
a
very
general
sense
like
``
oh
i
bet
one
of
the
people
who
's
died
is
n't
actually
dead
but
i
have
no
idea
who
it
might
be
''
so
i
was
kept
guessing
until
the
end
.
that
being
said
i
do
have
to
let
people
know
that
the
ending
is
the
kind
of
mystery
ending
that
i
hate
the
most
where
nobody
can
figure
out
who
the
killer
is
so
heshe
waits
until
the
last
page
and
then
starts
shouting
``
you
fools
i
totally
did
it
and
in
case
you
do
n't
believe
me
i
will
now
outline
precisely
how
i
managed
to
pull
off
every
single
aspect
of
my
murderous
scheme
''
blech
.
but
everything
before
that
was
a
damn
good
time
so
i
was
n't
even
that
mad

of

poolside
preferably
with
a
smuggled-in
piãa
colada
or
margarita
in

annual
viewing

weâve
stayed

long
â
he
doesnât

harperâs
island
he
doesnât

sharknado
â
i
should
be

for
sainthood.this
summer
iâve
kind
of
broken
free
of
the
confines
of
rule
1
-
not
saying
i
havenât
read
some
fluff
but
iâve
been
heavy
handed
in
choosing
more
thrillerhorror
novels
.
maybe
it
was
the
abnormally
cool
temps
that
not
only
kept
my
toes
out
of
the
water
but
also
helped
me
keep
my
wits
about
me
whatever
the
cause
iâve
had
some
serious
quality
reading
experiences
over
the
past
few
months
.
endless
thanks
to
twelvejan
alexandria
for
bringing
this
classic
tale
to
my
attention
.
i
had
read
a
handful
of
poirot
stories
back
in
the
paleolithic
era
but
found
them
to
be
just
âokayâ
.
after
reading
and
then
there
were
none
i
think
it
might
possibly
be
agatha
christieâs
best
work
.
ten
strangers
each
with
a
skeleton
in
the
closet
are
summoned
to
an
island
by
a
host
who
only
appears
as
a
voice
on
a
recording
accusing
the
guests
of
murder
.
what
follows
is
the
death
of
each
person
one
by
one
by
one
until
no
one
is
left
.
okay
so
maybe
the
murders
arenât
that
gruesome
but
we
are
talking
about
a
75
year
old
book
here
.
i
was
amazed
at
how
well
it
stood
the
test
of
time
and
how
it
had
me
gripping
the
edge
of
my
seat
in
anticipation
.
and
though
at
the
end
of
it
all
you
may
claim
to
have
known
who
the
murderer
was
all
along
you
mustnât
forget
all
the
times
you
changed
your
mind
because
your
choice
of
killer
was
one
of
the

home
just

was
my
favorite
book
in
5th

and
read
it
a
ton

then

i
even
know
who
the

is
and
i
'm
still
at
the

maybe
more
appropriately
edge

is
invited
to
a

by
a
mysterious
host
they

when

they
immediately
1.

figure
out
that
no

discern
that
each
person
is
hiding
a
dark
secret4
.
realize
they
were
all
blackmailed
into
comingthen
one
by
one
the
guests
begin
to
disappear
.
a
short
verse
about
10
little
indians
appears
at
each
crime
scene
.
those
remaining

those

is
my
all-time
favorite
agatha

mystery

the
reason
i
liked
it
so
much
was
that
i
could
not
figure
out
the
ending
until
the
last
page
so
it
left
me
stunned
many
of
her
other
novels
and
i
have
read
most
of
them
were
suspenseful
but
not
this
much
of
a
nail-biter

i
remember
this
story
from
a
fabulous
russian
movie
adaptation
and
while
reading
it
for
the
first
time
i
caught
myself
constantly
thinking
oh
how
i
wish
not
to
know
the
ending
this
was
a
truly
great
book
which
was
much
more
than
a
simple
mystery
but
rather
a
psychological
thriller
and
an
examination
of
criminal
mind
.

was
the
first
sophisticated
mystery
i
ever
read
and
its
effects
are
still
with
me
to
this
day
.
'lil
10-year-old
dave
green
was
completely
entranced
by
so
many
things
in
this
novel
...
the
bizarre
death-threat
in
the
form
of
a
poem
the
feeling
of
dread
and
helplessness
the
potential
victims
all
felt
the
chilling
murders
the
twist
ending
.
i
had
read
many
books
over
the
years
but
this
was
the
first
book
i
actually
felt
fear
excitement
gloom
and
even
joy
when
i
realized
the
author
had
completely
fooled
me
in
the
final
few
pages.sometimes
i
consider
rereading
this
book
but
as
corny
as
it
sounds
i
'm
afraid
that
reading
it
a
second
time
may
take
away
some
of
the
magic
for
me
.
it
's
like
when
you
watch
an
old
movie
you
loved
as
a
kid
and
find
yourself
saying
``
this
is
n't
nearly
as
good
as
i
remembered
''
no
``
and
then
there
was
one
''
was
a
book
that
had
a
profound
effect
on
me
and
even
though
it
's
been
over
25
years
since
i
read
it
it
will
always
have
a
special
place
in
my
heart

a

that
i
did

the

was
told
to
me
but
an
engaging
thriller
.
it
is
the
characters
that
make
the
story
so
amazing
.
with
hardly
any
time
spent
on
them
in
such
a
short
book
all
ten
of
the
main
characters
came
across
as
real
and
vibrant
.
after
only
a
few
pages
i
felt
that
i
understood
who
they
were
and
what
they
wanted
.
furthermore
i
felt
sorry
for
several
of
the
characters
even
though
they
were
really
villains
.
otherwise
there
is
little
to
say
for
the
story
because
it
was
so
short
.
i
suppose
it
suffices
to
say
that
it
was
one
of
the
best
short
books
iâve
ever
read
and
i
am
sure
i
will
be
reading
it
again.4
characters
the
characters
are
living
and
vibrant
.
they
feel
like
unique
individuals
rather
than
cardboard
cutouts
.
furthermore
christie
was
able
to
get
me
to
care
for
the
characters
and
relate
to
them
even
though
they
were
all
murderers
in
one
way
or
another.5
pace
no
part
of
this
book
was
boring
or
slow
.
as
soon
as
the
first
page
is
read
a
person
finds
themselves
forced
to
continue
.
no
time
is
wasted
.
the
characters
are
introduced
put
on
the
island
and
then
they
start
dying
.
the
pace
quickens
as
the
murders
continueâ
and
i
found
myself
missing
work
to
continue
reading.4
story
the
plot
behind
the
story
feels
slightly
thin-
that
a
madman
would
lure
nine
people
to
an
island
to
give
them
justice
society
could
not
but
it
serves
the
concept
and
it
works.4
dialogue
the
dialogue
between
characters
is
well
written
.
i
never
questioned
who
was
speaking
at
a
given
moment
though
i
did
frequently
wonder
just
who
was
thinking.3
styletechnical
i
wonder
if
the
style
is
indicative
of
the
times
.
there
are
many
paragraph
breaks
that
i
would
call
needless
and
she
prefaces
dialogue
with
a
single
short
paragraph
identifying
who
was
doing
the
speaking
.
it
was
never
difficult
and
always
clear
but
did
read
strangely
as
a
result
.
her
later
works
are
not
like
that.4
overall
this
is
a
good
book
.
i
can
understand
why
elements
of
it
have
been
adapted
to
broadly
for
other
books
comics
movies
and
video
games
.
i
will
be
reading
it
again
if
only
to
tap
into
the
strange
sense
of
unknown
terror
that
it
providesâ

review

my

this

as
half
of
our
corpus
when
we
wrote
our
1990
paper
an
implementable
semantics

comparative
constructions
.
we
spent
several
days
combing
through
the
text
extracting
and
categorizing
every
single
occurrence
of
a
comparative
construction
.
so
you
'll
appreciate
that
i
know
what
i
'm
talking
about
when
i
say
it
's
better
than
most
murder

she
did
a

job
with
the

i
really
enjoyed
this

read
more
from
her.obviously
though
i
had
a
few
problems
with
it
if
i
did
n't
give
it
5
stars
firstly
i
'm
not
completely
sold
on
the
ending
.
i
think
the
whole
``
red
herring
''
thing
was
brilliant
completely
did
n't
see
that
twist
coming
but
i
'm
just
left
unsatisfied
.
i
do
n't
know
what
i
wanted
but
i
do
n't
feel
like
i
totally
got
it
.
secondly
i
never
had
any
suspicions
.
one
thing
that
i
really
like
about
mysteries
is
blaming
people
``
it
's
that
guy
obviously
peeps
''
and
then
changing
your
mind
and
doubting
yourself
.
but
i
really
did
n't
feel
that
in
this
novel..
i
never
blamed
anyone
never
had
any
leading
ideas
as
to
who
it
might
have
been
which
was
too
bad
because
i
did
n't
feel
like
i
was
trying
to
solve
this
crime
there
was
n't
enough
evidence
or
clues
to
help
me
along
to
figuring
it
out
.
these
are
both
personal
issues
though
so
objectively
i
'd
probably
give
it
a
higher
ratingbonus
i
really
super
duper
loved
the
use
of
the
nursery
rhyme
.
even
though
you
know
exactly
how
the
next
murder
is
going
to
happen
you
still
have
no
idea
and
that
was
intriguing

in

her
writing
is
easily
adaptable
despite
the
classic
slang

prose
because
i
enjoyed
the
conversations
the
fast-paced
comically-relevant
murders
especially
how
she
depicted

very
well
in

attitudes

i
'll

the

as
well
as
changing

indians
.
once
again
the
novel
was
revived
and
now
the
song
title
has
been
changed
to
ten
little
soldiers
.
apart
from
the
offensive
name
of
the
book
originally
this
novel
was
wildly
successful
and
introduced
a
very
common
crime
trope
into
the
world
.
ten
people
trapped
in
a
house
on
an
island
trying
to
work
out
who
is
killing
them
off
one
by
one
.
iâm
sure
you
can
think
of
many
films
shows
and
books
that
have
paid
homage
to
this
theme.this
classic
crime
novel
looks
at
the
idea
of
administrating
justice
who
has
the
right
to
judge
others
and
what
happens
when
the
law
fails
.
iâm
going
to
try
to
avoid
spoilers
and
tell
you
who
the
killer
is
but
most
people
would
have
read
this
and
probably
remember
who
the
perpetrator
was
.
the
killer
believes
the
others
are
complacent
and
in
most
facts
while
they
deny
being
guilty
publically
are
living
tormented
lives
.
not
everyone
but
it
was
interesting
to
see
that
kind
of
turmoil
and
i
was
a
little
upset
to
see
that
wasnât
explored
in
greater
detail
.
having
said
that
i
think
the
torment
played
out
more
in
the
symbolism
and
motifs
.
iâm
thinking
about
the
dreams
and
hallucinations
the
guilty
consciences
of
the
victims
are
explored
here
or
the
storm
a
symbol
of
violence
that
cuts
them
off
from
the
world.the
killer
has
set
out
to
commit
the
perfect
crime
and
it
looks
good
on
paper
but
i
never
really
bought
into
it
.
while
reading
this
novel
i
had
a
feeling
that
the
cosy
crime
approach
is
playing
against
the
story
.
if
you
think
about
the
mess
made
from
the
violent
murders
wouldnât
help
the
police
work
out
what
happened
in
the
end
iâm
sure
they
wouldnât
rely
on
the
handwritten
accounts
the
evidence
would
be
inconsistent
.
making
this
far
from
a
perfect
crime
sorry
this
is
hard
to
explain
without
spoilers.this
was
my
first
agatha
christie
novel
and
while
i
enjoyed
it
there
is
one
thing
that
frustrated
me
.
i
hate
crime
novels
that
hold
back
important
pieces
of
evidence
and
expect
the
reader
to
work
out
what
happened
.
i
always
feel
like
the
author
is
trying
to
be
smug
but
really
it
is
just
poorly
executed
writing
.
it
wasnât
so
bad
in
this
novel
but
i
get
the
feeling
it
is
a
common
occurrence
in
all
her
novels
and
i
canât
stand
that
.
you
have
to
make
a
great
protagonist
to
make
up
for
the
withholding
of
information
.
it
works
better
as
a
first
person
narrative
the
unreliable
narrator
is
more
likely
to
forget
to
tell
you
important
clues.i
will
read
some
more
christie
i
hope
iâm
mistaken
about
the
withholding
of
clues
.
and
then
there
were
none
had
no
real
protagonist
but
maybe
a
hercule
poirot
miss
jane
marple
or
tommy
and
tuppence
mystery
hide
this
a
little
better
.
i
suspect
murder
on
the
orient
express
will
be
my
next
agatha
christie
read
but
who
knows
.
i
prefer
my
detectives
a
little
more
hard-boiled
so
it
might
be
awhile
between
christie
novels.this

qui
tutti
questi
elementi
vengono
meno
sono
tutti
colpevoli
non
ci
sono
investigatori
nessuno
smascheramento
o
punizione
finale
.
dieci
persone
dal
passato
oscuro
ognuna
delle
quali
si
ã
resa
responsabile
di
un
delitto
ed
ã
riuscita
a
sfuggire
alle
maglie
della
legge
vengono
convocate
con
un
pretesto
su
unâisola
da
un
misterioso
ricco
signore
.
moriranno
uno
ad
uno
uccisi
da
un
giustiziere
invisibile
che
segue
alla
lettera
i
versi
di
una
filastrocca
quella
dei
dieci
piccoli
indiani
per
lâappunto
.
ã
il
noto
schema
di
âdelitto
in
villa
chiusaâ
che
gli
sciagurati
adoratori
di
cartoni
animati
come
me
troveranno
molto
ricorrente
anche
in
conan
.
i
personaggi
creati
dallâautrice
in
questo
libro
sono
molto
diversi
di
quelli
che
ci
aspetteremmo
da
lei
.
hanno
piã¹
spessore
del
solito
ad
esempio
sono
tormentati
ombrosi
ambigui
.
si
muovono
in
un
clima
di
paura
e
di
accusa
che
li
spinge
a
mettersi
uno
contro
lâaltro
perchã
ignorano
chi
sia
il
loro
nemico
.
un
giallo
angosciante
da
cui
non
riuscirete
a
staccarvi
a
mio
avviso
superiore
anche
al
tanto
celebre
assassinio
sullâorient
express
anche
quello
curiosamente
bello
e
amorale
ma
io
sono
allergica
a
poirot
etciã¹
.
adoro
la
christie
nulla
da
aggiungere
.
la
preferisco
decisamente
a
conan
doyle
il
caro
sherlock
non
riesce
a
conquistarmi
lui
sa
sempre
tutto
e
a
noi
lettori
non
lascia
che
le
briciole
del
suo
acume
.
a
me
invece
piace
troppo
giocare
ad
indovinare
.
