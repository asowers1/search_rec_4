saga
.

aka
venom
and
gwen
stacy
respectively
.
peter
parker
maguire
has
finally
leaned
to
walk
the
middle
ground
between
being
the
superhero
that
his
city
needs
and
the
man
that
mary
jane
dunst
loves
.
all
is
well
in
new
york
city
until
one
night
as
peter
and
m.j.
sit
gazing
at
the
stars
a
falling
comet
streams
across
the
sky
and
crashes
into
the
ground
close
by
.
but
this
is
n't
any
ordinary
shooting
star
and
upon
impact
the
mysterious
space
rock
is
split
open
to
reveal
a
shape-shifting
symbiote
with
the
power
to
overtake
anything
that
it
comes
into
contact
with
.
later
as
harry
osborn
james
franco
acquires
his
late
father
's
flying
board
engineers
a
powerful

mysterious
space
sludge
infects
both
peter
's
spider-man
suit
and
ambitious
street
photographer
eddie
brock
grace
.
peter
's
strange
new
suit
gives
him
a
newfound
sense
of
power
as
it
gradually
overpowers
his
personality
and
he
discovers
that
escaped
convict
flint
marko
was
in
fact
the
man
responsible
for
the
death
of
uncle
ben
cliff
robertson
.
unfortunately
for
peter
marko
has
recently
acquired
the
power
to
morph
at
will
and
quickly
completes
his
transformation
into
the
dreaded
sandman
.
as
the
sandman
gives
in
to
his
darkest
criminal
instincts
and
the
slithering
space
symbiote
transforms
eddie
brock
into
the
nightmarish
fanged
villain
known
as
venom
the
citizens
of
new
york
city
must
once
again
call
on
spider-man
to
fend
off
destructive
forces
that
are
far
too
powerful
for
the
likes
of
mortal
man
.

so
i
think
the
main
number
one
big
ginormous
flaw
in
this
movie
is
the
fact
they
use
too
many
villains
and
plots
i
'm
sure
we
can
all
agree
on
this
.
way
back
in
1992
a
certain
young
mr
tim
burton
had
free
reign
to
create
the
sequel
for
his
smash
hit
'batman
'
.
in
doing
so
he
stuck
in
two
main
villains
alongside
his
own
creation
...
the
penguin
catwoman
and
max
shreck
.
this
seemed
to
start
a
massive
trend
that
has
continued
to
this
day
following
on
from
this
initial
idea
many
or
most
superhero
flicks
seem
to
have
at
least
two
villains
as
standard
sometimes
more
and
this
is
where
this
film
implodes.first
villain
is
venom
now
this
alien
creature
crashes
to
earth
in
or
on
meteorite
out
of
nowhere
and
that
's
it
we
get
nothing
more
on
it
at
all
.
no
idea
where
its
come
from
how
why
what
its
intentions
are
why
its
doing
what
its
doing
etc
...
its
just
there
and
you
got
ta
accept
it
.
whether
or
not
the
comics
give
us
this
information
i
do
n't
know
although
i
'm
sure
they
do
but
here
in
this
film
its
a
solid
mystery
for
anyone
who
is
n't
a
comic
fanboy
myself
included
.
so
back
story
and
the
way
this
character
is
played
out
in
the
film
is
new
to
me
i
have
no
idea
if
its
correct
alongside
the
source
material
all
i
know
is
how
this
thing
looks
and
it
did
seem
well
created
to
me
.
the
cgi
was
decent
and
seemed
to
capture
venom
's
appearance
well
although
why
it
would
alter
spider-man
's
spider
logo
seems
daft
it
infects
his
outfit
and
body
why
would
it
alter
the
logosecond
villain
was
the
sandman
who
i
know
was
bumped
up
from
a
minor
comic
position
to
a
major
role
revolving
around
parker
's
uncle
.
now
again
whether
or
not
this
was
the
right
way
to
go
if
you
're
a
fanboy
i
do
n't
know
as
for
the
rest
of
us
i
felt
the
story
arc
did
work
pretty
well
and
developed
the
sandman
into
something
other
than
just
a
common
baddie
.
this
character
now
had
a
good
solid
family
arc
combined
with
an
emotional
connection
to
parker
which
did
feel
a
little
forced
admittedly
like
a
clear
after
thought
but
it
managed
to
hold
together
.
i
also
liked
the
visual
design
for
this
guy
he
had
a
distinctly
old
fashioned
feel
about
him
like
a
criminal
from
the
40
's
.
the
characters
musical
theme
really
pushed
that
vibe
if
you
ask
me
a
very
bogart-esque
tune
.
i
liked
his
outfit
too
again
it
had
a
very
old
fashioned
look
about
it
like
something
gene
kelly
would
wear.the
final
villain
squeezed
into
the
film
was
harry
osborn
as
the
next
green
goblin
following
on
from
his
fathers
work
.
now
i
had
no
problem
with
this
character
being
here
because
he
's
been
here
since
the
beginning
and
it
felt
right
that
this
story
arc
should
happen
.
unfortunately
along
with
the
other
two
villains
it
all
felt
so
convoluted
and
tight
for
space
that
the
poor
old
goblin
was
reduced
to
sporadic
appearances
.
well
they
all
were
really
venom
especially
so
that
thing
vanished
for
half
the
flick
.
the
goblin
gets
conveniently
injured
right
at
the
start
after
a
horrendously
bad
cgi
battle
in
the
sky
with
spidey
and
we
do
n't
see
him
again
for
ages
.
its
the
same
spiel
as
before
with
this
character
just
replace
dafoe
with
franco
same
action
sequences
new
outfit
that
's
all
looks
worse
too
.
so
in
that
sense
it
seemed
weak
but
you
knew
he
had
to
be
there
if
anything
they
should
of
dropped
venom
as
that
really
seemed
crowbarred
in
jostling
for
any
kind
of
screen
time.the
other
problem
i
had
with
this
film
other
than
the
multitude
of
villains
was
the
relationship
between
parker
and
mary
jane
.
oh
my
balls
this
got
annoying
first
they
're
together
then
they
're
not
then
they
get
back
together
again
then
mary
jane
sluts
around
with
osborn
then
parker
again
plus
you
've
got
gwen
stacy
in
there
too
...
holy
ribbons
of
snot
i
got
so
fed
up
of
seeing
parker
and
mary
jane
fighting
whining
and
crying
jesus
.
plus
the
fact
mary
jane
gets
fired
from
her
stage
show
after
one
performance
seemed
a
bit
ridiculous
and
is
obviously
done
to
crank
up
the
annoying
emotional
relationship
issues
.
then
you
've
got
all
that
crap
where
parker
goes
to
the
dark
side
due
to
the
venom
alien
.
parker
as
a
dark
character
apparently
translates
to
a
lame
looking
emo
hairstyle
a
bit
of
goth
eye
shadow
and
then
acting
like
'the
mask
'
in
a
nightclub
what
an
embarrassing
mess
that
wasi
must
admit
to
being
disappointed
with
the
effects
this
time
also
is
it
me
or
do
the
effects
actually
get
worse
after
the
first
film
seeing
spidey
swinging
from
rooftop
to
rooftop
is
still
sweet
venom
was
cool
and
the
sandman
had
some
great
effects
in
places
but
the
action
sequences
became
very
hard
to
follow
with
fast
moving
terrible
looking
cgi
.
as
i
already
said
the
initial
fight
between
osborn
and
spidey
was
awful
looking
but
the
big
finale
was
just
a
shambles
of
shoddy
cgi
and
greenscreen
a
lot
of
it
looked
very
obvious
to
me
.
also
not
so
sure
why
or
how
the
sandman
is
able
to
grow
to
such
massive
proportions
or
fly
how
does
sand
enable
that
and
he
kinda
looked
like
a
big
lump
of
poo.i
honestly
think
this
is
the
most
over
stuffed
flick
i
've
seen
for
some
time
or
ever
it
really
is
so
overloaded
and
overly
long
.
stands
to
reason
this
effects
the
film
negatively
which
is
a
shame
seeing
as
this
franchise
has
n't
been
too
bad
.
the
best
bit
in
this
film
for
me
was
probably
the
amusing
cameo
from
bruce
campbell
again
doing
his
best
snappy
snooty
french
maitre
d
'
.
seems
incredible
to
say
that
i
know
but
it
was
a
fun
little
scene
everything
else
was
a
mess
frankly
...
apart
from
the
odd
visual
moment
.
there
are
huge
periods
where
characters
disappear
from
the
film
entirely
so
other
sub
plots
can
continue
sandman
and
venom
osborn
and
parker
end
up
fighting
over
mary
jane
instead
of
osborn
's
dead
father
osborn
's
butler
is
a
horrible
alfred
rip
off
the
guy
acting
in
the
role
is
dreadful
plus
he
only
now
in
this
film
tells
harry
about
how
his
father
was
really
killed
and
lastly
even
though
the
sandman
's
story
arc
worked
ok
and
has
a
good
heart
it
did
feel
like
they
were
trying
to
rewrite
the
original
film
.
so
definitely
ambitious
and
not
a
total
complete
disaster
but
clearly
one
bad
guy
would
have
worked
out
better
we
now
all
know
venom
was
only
stuck
in
there
to
maximise
the
audience
due
to
the
characters
popularity
.
i
understand
that
but
really
they
should
have

better

harry
loses
his
memory
after
attacking
peter
and
their
friendship
is
seemingly
restored
leaving
him
free
to
hunt
down
the
man
truly
responsible
for
uncle
ben
's
death
.
however
things
are
complicated
by
his
transformation
into
the
sandman
and
the
appearance
of
an
alien
creature
that
enhances
peter
's
negative
emotions
.
there
's
actually
a
pretty
decent
sequel
hidden
inside
the
bloated
episodic
mess
that
is
spider-man
3
.
sam
raimi
's
presence
at
the
helm
is
marred
by
his
inability
to
resist
the
keys
to
the
sfx
toy
shop
but
the
cast
are
still
likable
the
comic
relief
and
jk
simmons
in
particular
is
still
funny
and
there
's
plenty
of
pacey
action
to
maintain
the
attention
.
the
big
problem
is
with
the
script
which
relies
far
too
much
on
contrivance
and
totally
implausible
coincidence
.
the
most
frustrating
thing
is
that
it
could
so
easily
have
been
corrected
by
the
complete
removal
of
the
utterly
ham-fisted
and
largely
irrelevant
venom
sub-plot
.
all
the
weakest
elements
of
the
film
are
tied
up
in
it
from
topher
grace
's
terrible
performance
to
the
impossible
to
believe
coincidences
to
the
frankly
embarrassing
jazz
dancing
emo
parker
sequence
.
it
's
a
shame
because
this
wrecks
the
second
half
of
the
film
and
just
detracts
from
some
pretty
decent
character
moments
from
peter
harry
and
even
the
sandman
himself
.
yet
another
abject
lesson
that
in
film
making
more
often
can
mean
less

i
'm
not
going
to
lie
has
tons
of
plot
holes
however
i
find
this
film
extremely
entertaining
ever
since
i
first
laid
eyes
on
this
film
in
theatres
i
was
hooked
on
all
the
cheesy
cgi
that
they
chose
to
throw
in
.
i
could
watch
this
film
over
and
over
again
laughing
at
the
random
cast
choices
and
acting
but
my
belief
still
stands
that
if
it
is
excluded
from
the
first
two
films
then
it
would
be
a
great
film
without
it
's
corniness
and
it
's
unbearably
cheesy
scenes
of
cgi
it
is
comparable
to
the
first
film
.
it
strays
away
from
the
comic
books
which
we
all
know
that
raimi
has
already
done
since
the
beginning
but
this
time
he
went
a
little
overboard
when
thinking
about
plot
lines
.
he
places
far
too
many
and
much
too
many
villains
.
overall
i
must
say
that
it
is
the
most
entertaining
film
of
the
trilogy
to
just
kick
back
and
watch
some
action
but
without
the
heart
of
the
first
two
it
unravels
.
``
spider-man
3
''
works
very
hard
to
hold
it
's
audience
and
it
does
succeed
but
only
to
fans
of
the
first
two
.
it
will
not
gain
any
new
fans
.
this
film
could
have
the
title
of
``
awesome
''
but
there
is
too
much
wrong
with
it
.
``
spider-man
3
''
despite
what
the
critics
have
to
say
it
a
very
fun
ride

the
next

needs
to
focus
solely
on
j
jonah
jameson
j.k.
simmons
.
he
is
the
most
entertaining
element
to
spider-man
3
a
film
that
is
just
filled
with
bland
setups
predictable
romantic
tension
an

peter
parker
and
the
worst
possible
depiction
of
venom
-
of
which
they
never
use
this
name
.
it
's
not
just
that
there
's
too
much
going
on
.
it
's
that
none
of
it
is
interesting
.
a
huge
disappointment
