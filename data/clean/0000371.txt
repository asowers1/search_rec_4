lambs
know
the
power
of
this
classic
mariah
ballad
â
but
itâs
time
it
gets
its
due

joins
the
canon
of
great
love
songs
.
mariah
narrates
the
devastating
life-altering
moment
of
falling
in
love
at
first
sight
and
her
delivery
is
so
heart-bursting
when
she
sings
âi
could
not
breathe
i
fell
so
deepâ
your
chest
tightens
with
each
note
.
that
the
song
is
about
previously
not
believing
this
kind
of
transformative
moment
was
possible
âand
i
thought
it
was
all
untrue
until
there
all
at

knewâ
gives
the
final
crescendo

much
more
heft

what
makes

stand
out
is
the
fact
that
mariah
incorporates
elements
of
doo-wop
along
with
contemporary

and
it
actually
works
.
her
enchanting
voice
flutters
on
the
song
and
the
âdum

infectious

itâs
kind
of
insane
that
âthe

monster
classic
rb
hit
but
somehow
it
just
never
got
its

itâs
not

mariahâs
sexiest

itâs
also
a
song
that
still
feels
just
as
fresh
sultry
and
baby-making
today
as
it
did
in
1998
.
and
the
lyrics
are
basically
as
titillating
as
a
soft-core
romance
novel

specific
and
well-written

basically
this

âbabydollâ

the
release
of
mariahâs
butterfly
not
only
conveyed
an
obvious
departure
from
the
big
swooping
ballads
she
sang
during
the
early
â90s
it
was
also
a
sexual
awakening
for
the
songbird
.
on
âbabydollâ
she
sings
âzoning
out
thinking
âbout
you
and
me
between
the
sheets
i
wan
na
get
intimate
but
youâre
not
within
my
reach.â
the
lead
single
from
this
album
âhoneyâ
may
have
been
overtly
sexual
but
âbabydollâ
is
its
polar
opposite
combining
a
syrupy
sweet
melody
with
alluring
and
loving
lyrics
