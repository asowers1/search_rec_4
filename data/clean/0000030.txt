placed
in
a

past

back
story
the
back
story
begins
thousands
of
years
before
the
action
in
the
book
with
the
rise
of
the
eponymous
lord
of
the
rings
the
dark
lord
sauron
a
malevolent
incarnated
immortal
spiritual
being
who
possessed
great
supernatural
powers
and
who
later
became
the
ruler
of
the
dreaded
realm
of
mordor
.
at
the
end
of
the
first
age
of
middle-earth
sauron
survived
the
catastrophic
defeat
and
chaining
of
his
lord
the
ultimate
dark
lord
morgoth
bauglir
who
was
formerly
counted
as
one
of
the
vala
the
angelic
powers
of
the
world
.
during
the
second
age
sauron
schemed
to
gain
dominion
over
middle-earth
.
in
the
disguise
as
``
annatar
''
or
lord
of
gifts
he
aided
celebrimbor
and
other
elven-smiths
of
eregion
in
the
forging
of
magical
rings
which
confer
various
powers
and
effects
on
their
wearers
.
the
most
important
of
these
were
the
nine
the
seven
an
the
three
which
he
did
not
touch
or
know
of
the
three
.
called
the
rings
of
power
or
great
rings
.
however
he
then
secretly
forged
a
great
ring
of
his
own
the
one
ring
by
which
he
planned
to
enslave
the
wearers
of
the
other
rings
of
power
.
this
plan
failed
when
the
elves
became
aware
of
him
and
took
off
their
rings
.
sauron
then
launched
a
war
during
which
he
captured
sixteen
and
distributed
them
to
lords
and
kings
of
dwarves
and
men
these
rings
were
known
as
the
seven
and
the
nine
respectively
.
the
dwarf-lords
proved
too
tough
to
enslave
although
their
natural
desire
for
wealth
especially
gold
increased
this
brought
more
conflict
between
them
and
other
races
.
the
men
who
possessed
the
nine
were
slowly
corrupted
over
time
and
eventually
became
the
nazgãl
or
ringwraiths
sauron
's
most
feared
servants
.
the
three
sauron
failed
to
capture
and
remained
in
the
possession
of
the
elves
who
forged
these
independently
.
the
war
ended
as
the
men
of
the
island-nation
of
nãºmenor
a
great
nation
helped
the
besieged
elves
and
sauron
's
forces
retreated
from
the
coasts
of
eriador
.
at
this
time
he
still
held
most
of
middle-earth
excluding
imladris
rivendell
and
the
gulf
of
lune
.
a
map
of
nãºmenor
called
andor
by
the
elves
.
over
1500
years
later
word
reaches
the
current
kings
of
nãºmenor
ar-pharazãn
that
sauron
has
been
bearing
the
title
``
lord
of
all
middle-earth
''
.
this
provoked
ar-pharazãn
and
gave
him
an
opportunity
to
show
the
glory
and
strength
of
nãºmenor
.
he
arrived
in
middle-earth
with
such
overwhelming
force
that
sauron
's
armies
flee
at
the
sight
of
them
.
abandoned
by
his
minions
sauron
surrendered
to
the
nãºmenã³reans
and
was
taken
to
nãºmenor
as
a
``
prisoner
''
.
sauron
then
started
to
poison
the
minds
of
the
nãºmenã³reans
against
the
valar
.
thus
sauron
set
into
motion
events
that
brought
about
nãºmenor
's
destruction
.
he
did
this
by
corrupting
the
king
's
mind
telling
him
that
the
immortality
of
the
elves
was
his
to
take
if
he
set
foot
upon
the
lands
of
aman
the
blessed
realm
where
valinor
the
realm
of
the
valar
was
located
.
with
old
age
on
his
mind
ar-pharazãn
lead
an
invasion
of
aman
and
valinor
with
the
greatest
host
seen
since
the
end
of
the
first
age
.
however
upon
reaching
aman
he
and
his
army
were
buried
by
a
landslide
and
there
they
would
remain
until
the
final
battle
in
tolkien
's
eschatology
.
manwã
the
king
of
arda
calls
upon
eru
ilãºvatar
god
who
opened
a
great
chasm
in
the
sea
destroying
nãºmenor
and
removed
the
undying
lands
from
the
mortal
world
.
the
destruction
of
nãºmenor
destroyed
sauron
's
fair
and
handsome
physical
body
but
his
spirit
returned
to
mordor
and
assumes
a
new
form
â
black
burning
hot
though
he
was
not
on
fire
and
terrible
.
over
100
years
later
he
launched
an
attack
against
the
nãºmenã³rean
exiled
the
faithful
who
did
not
join
ar-pharazãn
's
expedition
who
managed
to
escape
to
middle-earth
.
however
the
exiles
led
by
elendil
and
his
sons
isildur
and
anãrion
had
time
to
prepare
and
after
forming
the
last
alliance
of
elves
and
men
with
the
elven-king
gil-galad
they
marched
against
mordor
defeated
sauron
on
the
plain
of
dagorlad
and
besieged
barad-dãr
at
which
time
anãrion
was
slain
.
after
seven
years
of
siege
sauron
himself
was
ultimately
forced
to
engage
in
single
combat
with
the
leaders
.
gil-galad
and
elendil
perished
as
they
combat
sauron
and
elendil
's
sword
narsil
broke
beneath
him
.
however
sauron
's
body
was
also
overcome
and
slain4
and
isildur
cut
the
one
ring
from
sauron
's
hand
with
the
hilt-shard
of
narsil
and
at
this
sauron
's
spirit
flees
and
does
not
reappear
in
his
terrible
form
for
many
centuries
.
isildur
was
advised
to
destroy
the
one
ring
by
the
only
way
it
could
be
â
by
casting
it
into
the
volcanic
mount
doom
where
it
was
forged
â
but
he
refused
attracted
to
its
beauty
and
kept
it
as
compensation
for
the
deaths
of
his
father
and
brother
weregild
.
so
began
the
third
age
of
middle-earth
.
two
years
later
while
journeying
to
rivendell
isildur
and
his
soldiers
were
ambushed
by
a
band
of
orcs
at
what
was
eventually
called
the
disaster
of
the
gladden
fields
.
while
the
latter
were
almost
all
killed
isildur
escaped
by
putting
on
the
ring
â
which
made
mortal
wearers
invisible
.
however
the
ring
slipped
from
his
finger
while
he
was
swimming
in
the
great
river
anduin
he
was
killed
by
orc-arrows
and
the
ring
was
lost
for
two
millennia
.
it
was
then
found
by
chance
by
a
hobbit
named
dãagol
.
his
relative
and
friend4
smãagol
strangled
him
for
the
ring
and
was
banished
from
his
home
by
his
maternal
grandmother
.
he
fled
to
the
misty
mountains
where
he
slowly
withered
and
became
a
disgusting
slimy
creature
called
gollum
.
in
the
hobbit
set
60
years
before
the
events
in
the
lord
of
the
rings
tolkien
relates
the
story
of
the
seemingly
accidental
finding
of
the
ring
by
another
hobbit
bilbo
baggins
who
takes
it
to
his
home
bag
end
.
story-externally
the
tale
related
in
the
hobbit
was
written
before
the
lord
of
the
rings
and
it
was
only
later
that
the
author
developed
bilbo
's
magic
ring
into
the
``
one
ring
.
''
neither
bilbo
nor
the
wizard
gandalf
are
aware
at
this
point
that
bilbo
's
magic
ring
is
the
one
ring
forged
by
the
dark
lord
sauron
.

during
the
third
age
the
lord
of
the
rings
takes
up
the
story
about
60
years
after
the
end
of
the
hobbit
.
the
story
begins
in
the
first
volume
the
fellowship
of
the
ring
when
frodo
baggins
bilbo
's
adoptive
heir
came
into
possession
of
bilbo
's
magic
ring
.
bilbo
's
old
friend
gandalf
the
grey
who
got
bilbo
involved
in
the
adventures
in
the
hobbit
that
led
to
the
discovery
of
the
ring
discovered
that
it
was
in
fact
the
one
ring
the
instrument
of
sauron
's
power
and
the
object
for
which
the
dark
lord
has
been
searching
for
most
of
the
third
age
and
which
corrupted
others
with
desire
for
it
and
the
power
it
held
.
sauron
sent
the
sinister
ringwraiths
in
the
guise
of
riders
in
black
to
the
shire
frodo
's
native
land
in
search
of
the
ring
.
frodo
escaped
with
the
help
of
his
loyal
gardener
sam
gamgee
and
three
close
friends
merry
brandybuck
pippin
took
and
fatty
bolger
.
while
fatty
acted
as
decoy
for
the
ringwraiths
frodo
and
the
others
set
off
to
take
the
ring
to
the
elven
haven
of
rivendell
.
they
were
aided
by
the
enigmatic
tom
bombadil
who
saved
them
from
old
man
willow
and
took
them
in
for
a
few
days
of
feasting
rest
and
counsel
.
at
the
town
of
bree
frodo
's
party
was
joined
by
a
man
called
``
strider
''
who
was
revealed
in
a
letter
left
by
gandalf
at
the
local
inn
for
frodo
to
be
aragorn
the
heir
to
the
kingships
of
gondor
and
arnor
two
great
realms
founded
by
the
nãºmenã³rean
exiles
.
aragorn
led
the
hobbits
to
rivendell
on
gandalf
's
request
.
however
frodo
was
gravely
wounded
by
the
leader
of
the
ringwraiths
though
he
managed
to
recover
under
the
care
of
the
half-elven
lord
elrond
.
in
rivendell
the
hobbits
also
learned
that
sauron
's
forces
could
only
be
resisted
if
aragorn
took
up
his
inheritance
and
fulfilled
an
ancient
prophecy
by
wielding
the
sword
andãºril
which
had
been
forged
anew
from
the
shards
of
narsil
the
sword
that
cut
the
ring
from
sauron
's
finger
in
the
second
age
.
a
high
council
attended
by
representatives
of
the
major
races
of
middle-earth
elves
dwarves
and
men
and
presided
over
by
elrond
decide
that
the
only
course
of
action
that
can
save
middle-earth
is
to
destroy
the
ring
by
taking
it
to
mordor
and
casting
it
into
mount
doom
where
it
was
forged
.
frodo
volunteered
for
the
task

took
them
through

they
were
being
followed
by
the
wretched
creature
gollum

bilbo
had
met
in

goblin-caves
of
the
misty
mountains
years
before

the
full
tale
of
their
meeting
is
told
in

gollum
long
possessed
the
ring
before
it
passed
to

gandalf
explained
that
gollum
belonged
to
a
people

of

before
he
came
upon

the
fellowship
now
led
by
aragorn
go
to
the

realm
of
lothlã³rien
.
here
the
lady
galadriel
showed
frodo
and
sam
visions
of
the
past
present
and
future
.
frodo
also
saw
the
eye
of
sauron
a
metaphysical
expression
of
sauron
himself
and
galadriel
was
tempted
by
the
ring
.
by
the
end
of
the
first
volume
after
the
fellowship
has
travelled
along
the
great
river
anduin
frodo
decided
to
continue
the
trek
to
mordor
on
his
own
largely
due
to
the
ring
's
growing
influence
on
boromir
however
the
faithful
sam
insisted
on
going
with
him
.
in
the
second
volume
the
two

a
parallel
story
told
in

details
the

aided
the

in
its
war
against
the
emerging
evil
of
saruman
leader
of
the
order

wizards
who
wanted

for
himself

at

the

scattered
merry
and
pippin
were
captured
by
sauron
and
saruman

boromir
was

wounded
defending
them
and
aragorn
and
the
others
went
off
in

the
three
met
gandalf
who
has
returned
to
middle-earth
as
``
gandalf
the
white
''
they
found
out
that
he
slew
the
balrog
of
moria
and
although
the
battle
also
proved
fatal
to
gandalf
he
was
then
sent
back
and
``
reborn
''
as
a
more
imposing
figure
.
at
the
end
of
the
first
book
gandalf
aragorn
legolas
and
gimli
helped
defeat
saruman
's
armies
at
the
battle
of
the
hornburg
while
saruman
himself
was
cornered
by
the
tree-like
ents
and
huorns
accompanied
by
merry
and
pippin
who
escaped
from
captivity
and
the
two
groups

paths
crossed
.
the
second
book
of
the
volume
tells
of
frodo
and
sam
's
exploits
on
the
way
to
mount
doom
.
they
managed
to
capture
and
``
tame
''
gollum
who
then
showed
them
a
way
to
enter
mordor
secretly
as
opposed
to
the
black
gate
albeit
through
the
dreaded
realm
of
minas
morgul
.
at
the
end
of
the
volume
gollum
betrayed
frodo
to
the
great
spider
shelob
and
though
he
survived
he
was
captured
by
orcs
.
meanwhile
sauron
launched
an
all-out
military
assault
upon
middle-earth
with
the
witch-king
leader
of
the
ringwraiths
leading
a
fell
host
from
minas
morgul
into
battle
against
gondor
in
the

king
the
further
adventures
of
gandalf
aragorn
and

book
of
the
volume
while
frodo
and
sam
's
are
related
in
the
second
as
with
the
two
towers
.
as
told
in
the
first
book
the
fellowship
assisted
in
the
final
battles
against
the
armies
of
sauron
including
the
siege
of
the
tower-city
of
minas
tirith
in
gondor
and
the
climactic
life-or-death
battle
before
the
black
gate
of
mordor
where
the
alliance
of
gondor
and
rohan
fought
desperately
against
sauron
's
armies
in
order
to
distract
him
from
the
ring
hoping
to
gain
time
for
frodo
to
destroy
it
.
in
the
second
book
sam
rescued
frodo
from
captivity
.
after
much
struggle
they
finally
reached
mount
doom
itself
tailed
by
gollum
.
however
the
temptation
of
the
ring
proved
too
great
for
frodo
and
he
claimed
it
for
himself
.
however
gollum
struggled
with
him
and
managed
to
bite
the
ring
off
.
crazed
with
triumph
gollum
slipped
into
the
fires
of
the
mountain
and
the
ring
was
destroyed
.
finally
sauron
was
defeated
and
aragorn
was
crowned
king
.
however
all
was
not
over
for
saruman
managed
to
escape
and
scour
the
shire
before
being
overthrown
.
at
the
end
frodo
remained
wounded
in
body
and
spirit
and
went
west
accompanied
by
bilbo
over
the
sea
to
valinor
where
he
could
find
peace
.

the
lord
of
the
rings
was
started
as
a
sequel
to
the
hobbit
a
fantasy
story
that
tolkien
had
written
for
and
read
to
his
children
which
was
published
in
1937.10
the
popularity
of
the
hobbit
led
to
demands
from
his
publishers
for
more
stories
about
hobbits
and
goblins
and
so
that
same
year
at
the
age
of
45
tolkien
began
writing
the
story
that
would
become
the
lord
of
the
rings
.
the
story
would
not
be
finished
until
12
years
later
in
1949
and
it
would
not
be
fully
published
until
1955
by
which
time
tolkien
was
63
years
old
.
tolkien
did
not
originally
intend
to
write
a
sequel
to
the
hobbit
and
instead
wrote
several
other
children
's
tales
including
roverandom
.
as
his
main
work
tolkien
began
to
outline
the
history
of
arda
telling
tales
of
the
silmarils
and
many
other
stories
of
how
the
races
and
situations
that
we
read
about
in
the
lord
of
the
rings
came
to
be
.
tolkien
died
before
he
could
complete
and
put
together
this
work
today
known
as
the
silmarillion
but
his
son
christopher
tolkien
edited
his
father
's
work
filled
in
gaps
and
published
it
in
1977.11
some
tolkien
biographers
regard
the
silmarillion
as
the
true
``
work
of
his
heart
''
12
as
it
provides
the
historical
and
linguistic
context
for
the
more
popular
work
and
for
his
constructed
languages
and
occupied
the
greater
part
of
tolkien
's
time
.
as
a
result
the
lord
of
the
rings
ended
up
as
the
last
movement
of
tolkien
's
legendarium
and
in
his
own
as
a
``
much
larger
and
i
hope
also
in
proportion
the
best
of
the
entire
cycle
''

persuaded
by
his
publishers
he
started
'a
new
hobbit
'
in
december
1937.10
after
several
false
starts
the
story
of
the
one
ring
soon
emerged
and
the
book
mutated
from
being
a
sequel
to
the
hobbit
to
being
in
theme
more
a
sequel
to
the
unpublished
silmarillion
.
the
idea
of
the
first
chapter
a
long-expected
party
arrived
fully-formed
although
the
reasons
behind
bilbo
's
disappearance
the
significance
of
the
ring
and
the
title
the
lord
of
the
rings
did
not
arrive
until
the
spring
of
1938.10
originally
he
planned
to
write
another
story
in
which
bilbo
had
used
up
all
his
treasure
and
was
looking
for
another
adventure
to
gain
more
however
he
remembered
the
ring
and
its
powers
and
decided
to
write
about
it
instead.10
he
began
with
bilbo
as
the
main
character
but
decided
that
the
story
was
too
serious
to
use
the
fun-loving
hobbit
and
so
tolkien
looked
to
use
a
member
of
bilbo
's
family.10
he
thought
about
using
bilbo
's
son
but
this
generated
some
difficult
questions
such
as
the
whereabouts
of
his
wife
and
whether
he
would
let
his
son
go
into
danger
.
thus
he
looked
for
an
alternate
character
to
carry
the
ring
.
in
greek
legend
it
was
a
hero
's
nephew
that
gained
the
item
of
power
and
so
the
hobbit
frodo
came
into
existence.10
writing
was
slow
due
to
tolkien
's
perfectionism
and
was
frequently
interrupted
by
his
obligations
as
an
examiner
and
other
academic
duties.source
the
first
sentence
of
the
hobbit
was
in
fact
written
on
a
blank
page
which
a
student
had
left
on
an
exam
paper
which
tolkien
was
marking
â
``
in
a
hole
in
the
ground
there
lived
a
hobbit
.
``
13
he
seems
to
have
abandoned
the
lord
of
the
rings
during
most
of
1943
and
only
restarted
it
in
april
1944.10
this
effort
was
written
as
a
serial
for
christopher
tolkien
and
c.s
.
lewis
â
the
former
would
be
sent
copies
of
chapters
as
they
were
written
while
he
was
serving
in
africa
in
the
royal
air
force
.
he
made
another
push
in
1946
and
showed
a
copy
of
the
manuscript
to
his
publishers
in
1947.10
the
story
was
effectively
finished
the
next
year
but
tolkien
did
not
finish
revising
earlier
parts
of
the
work
until
1949.10
a
dispute
with
his
publishers
allen
unwin
led
to
the
book
being
offered
to
harpercollins
in
1950
.
he
intended
the
silmarillion
itself
largely
unrevised
at
this
point
to
be
published
along
with
the
lord
of
the
rings
but
au
were
unwilling
to
do
this
.
after
his
contact
at
collins
milton
waldman
expressed
the
belief
that
the
lord
of
the
rings
itself
``
urgently
needed
cutting
''
he
eventually
demanded
that
they
publish
the
book
in
1952
.
they
did
not
do
so
and
so
tolkien
wrote
to
allen
and
unwin
saying
``
i
would
gladly
consider
the
publication
of
any
part
of
the
stuff
.

delays
in

respectively
in
the
united
kingdom
slightly
later
in
the
united
states
.
the
return
of
the
king
was
especially
delayed
.
tolkien
moreover
did
not
especially
like
the
title
the
return
of
the
king
believing
it
gave
away
too
much
of
the
storyline
.
he
had
originally
suggested
war
of
the
ring
which
was
dismissed
by
his
publishers.14

edition
the
books
were
published
under
a
'profit-sharing
'
arrangement
whereby
tolkien
would
not
receive
an
advance
or
royalties
until
the
books
had
broken
even
after
which
he
would
take
a
large
share
of
the
profits
.
an
index
to
the
entire
3-volume
set
at
the
end
of
third
volume
was
promised
in
the
first
volume
.
however
this
proved
impractical
to
compile
in
a
reasonable
timescale
.
later
in
1966
four
indices
not
compiled
by
tolkien
were
added
to
the
return
of
the
king
.
because
the
three-volume

was
so
widely

is

publisher
ace
books
realized
that
the
lord
of
the
rings
was
not
protected
in
the
united
states
under
american
copyright
law
because
the
us
hardcover
edition
had
been
bound
from
pages
printed
in
the
united
kingdom
with
the
original
intention
being
for
them
to
be
printed
in
the
british
edition
.
ace
books
proceeded
to
publish
an
edition
unauthorized
by
tolkien
and
without
royalties
to
him
.
tolkien
took
issue
with
this
and
quickly
notified
his
fans
of
this
objection
.
grass-roots
pressure
from
these
fans
became
so
great
that
ace
books
withdrew
their
edition
and
made
a
nominal
payment
to
tolkien
well
below
what
he
might
have
been
due
in
an
appropriate
publication
.
however
this
poor
beginning
was
overshadowed
when
an
authorized
edition
followed
from
ballantine
books
to
tremendous
commercial
success
.
by
the
mid-1960s
the
books
due
to
their
wide
exposure
on
the
american
public
stage
had
become
a
true
cultural
phenomenon
.
also
at
this
time
tolkien
undertook
various
textual
revisions
to
produce
a
version
of
the
book
that
would
have
a
valid
us
copyright
.
this
would
later
become
known
as
the
second
edition
of
the
lord
of
the
rings
.
the
books
have
been
translated
with
various
degrees
of
success
into
dozens
of
other
languages.15
tolkien
an
expert
in
philology
examined
many
of
these
translations
and
had
comments
on
each
that
reflect
both
the
translation
process
and
his
work
.
to
aid
translators
tolkien
wrote
his
guide
to
the
names
in
the
lord
of
the
rings
.
because
the
lord
of
the
rings
is
said
to
be
a
translation
of
the
red
book
of
westmarch
translators
have
an
unusual
degree
of
freedom
when
translating
the
lord
of
the
rings
.
this
allows
for
such
translations
as
elf
becoming
elb
in
german
â
elb
does
not
carry
the
connotations
of
mischief
that
its
english
counterpart
does
and
therefore
is
more
true
to
the
work
that
tolkien
created
.
in
contrast
to
the
usual
modern
practice
names
intended
to
have
a
particular
meaning
in
the
english
version
are
translated
to
provide
a
similar
meaning
in
the
target
language
in
german
for
example
the
name
``
baggins
''
becomes
``
beutlin
''
containing
the
word
beutel
meaning
``
bag
.

influences
the
lord
of
the
rings
began
as
a
personal
exploration
by
tolkien
of
his
interests
in
philology
religion
particularly
roman
catholicism
fairy
tales
as
well
as
norse
and
celtic
mythology
but
it
was
also
crucially
influenced
by
the
effects
of
his
military
service
during
world
war
i.16
tolkien
detailed
his
creation
to
an
astounding
extent
he
created
a
complete
mythology
for
his
realm
of
middle-earth
including
genealogies
of
characters
languages
writing
systems
calendars
and
histories
.
some
of
this
supplementary
material
is
detailed
in
the
appendices
to
the
lord
of
the
rings
and
the
mythological
history
woven
into
a
large
biblically-styled
volume
entitled
the
silmarillion
.
however
many
parts
of
the
world
he
crafted
as
he
freely
admitted
are
influenced
by
other
sources
.
tolkien
's
largest
influences
in
the
creation
of
his
world
were
his
catholic
faith
and
the
bible.17
tolkien
once
described
the
lord
of
the
rings
to
his
friend
the
english
jesuit
father
robert
murray
as
``
a
fundamentally
religious
and
catholic
work
unconsciously
so
at
first
but
consciously
in
the
revision
.
``
4
there
are
many
theological
themes
underlying
the
narrative
including
the
battle
of
good
versus
evil
the
triumph
of
humility
over
pride
and
the
activity
of
grace
.
in
addition
the
saga
includes
themes
which
incorporate
death
and
immortality
mercy
and
pity
resurrection
salvation
repentance
self-sacrifice
free
will
justice
fellowship
authority
and
healing
.
in
addition
the
lord
's
prayer
``
and
lead
us
not
into
temptation
but
deliver
us
from
evil
''
was
reportedly
present
in
tolkien
's
mind
as
he
described
frodo
's
struggles
against
the
power
of
the
one
ring.4
non-christian
religious
motifs
also
had
strong
influences
in
tolkien
's
middle-earth
.
his
ainur
a
race
of
angelic
beings
who
are
responsible
for
conceptualising
the
world
includes
the
valar
the
pantheon
of
``
gods
''
who
are
responsible
for
the
maintenance
of
everything
from
skies
and
seas
to
dreams
and
doom
and
their
servants
the
maiar
.
the
concept
of
the
valar
echoes
greek
and
norse
mythologies
although
the
ainur
and
the
world
itself
are
all
creations
of
a
monotheistic
deity
â
ilãºvatar
or
eru
``
the
one
''
.
as
the
external
practice
of
middle-earth
religion
is
downplayed
in
the
lord
of
the
rings
explicit
information
about
them
is
only
given
in
the
different
versions
of
silmarillion
material
.
however
there
remain
allusions
to
this
aspect
of
tolkien
's
mythos
including
``
the
great
enemy
''
who
was
sauron
's
master
and
``
elbereth
queen
of
stars
''
morgoth
and
varda
respectively
two
of
the
valar

the
main

``
authorities
''
referring
to
the
valar
literally
powers
in
the
prologue
and
``
the
one
''
in
appendix
a
.
other
non-christian
mythological
elements
can
be
seen
including
other
sentient
non-humans
dwarves
elves
hobbits
and
ents
a
``
green
man
''
tom
bombadil
and
spirits
or
ghosts
barrow-wights
oathbreakers
.
gandalf
the
``
odinic
wanderer
''
from
a
book
cover
by
john
howe
.
the
mythologies
from
northern
europe
are
perhaps
the
best
known
non-christian
influences
on
tolkien
.
his
elves
and
dwarves
are
by
and
large
based
on
norse
and
related
germanic
mythologies
.
citation
needed
the
figure
of
gandalf
is
particularly
influenced
by
the
germanic
deity
odin
in
his
incarnation
as
``
the
wanderer
''
an
old
man
with
one
eye
a
long
white
beard
a
wide
brimmed
hat
and
a
staff
tolkien
states
that
he
thinks
of
gandalf
as
an
``
odinic
wanderer
''
in
a
letter
of
1946.4
finnish
mythology
and
more
specifically
the
finnish
national
epic
kalevala
were
also
acknowledged
by
tolkien
as
an
influence
on
middle-earth
.
citation
needed
in
a
similar
manner
to
the
lord
of
the
rings
the
kalevala
centres
around
a
magical
item
of
great
power
the
sampo
which
bestows
great
fortune
on
its
owner
but
never
makes
its
exact
nature
clear
.
like
the
one
ring
the
sampo
is
fought
over
by
forces
of
good
and
evil
and
is
ultimately
lost
to
the
world
as
it
is
destroyed
towards
the
end
of
the
story
.
in
another
parallel
the
latter
work
's
wizard
character
vãinãmãinen
also
has
many
similarities
to
gandalf
in
his
immortal
origins
and
wise
nature
and
both
works
end
with
their
respective
wizard
departing
on
a
ship
to
lands
beyond
the
mortal
world
.
tolkien
also
based
his
elvish
language
quenya
on
finnish.18
in
addition
the
lord
of
the
rings
was
crucially
influenced
by
tolkien
's
experiences
during
world
war
i
and
his
son
's
during
world
war
ii
.
the
central
action
of
the
books
â
a
climactic
age-ending
war
between
good
and
evil
â
is
the
central
event
of
many
world
mythologies
notably
norse
but
it
is
also
a
clear
reference
to
the
well-known
description
of
world
war
i
which
was
commonly
referred
to
as
``
the
war
to
end
all
wars
.
''
after
the
publication
of
the
lord
of
the
rings
these
influences
led
to
speculation
that
the
one
ring
was
an
allegory
for
the
nuclear
bomb.19
tolkien
however
repeatedly
insisted
that
his
works
were
not
an
allegory
of
any
kind
.
however
there
is
a
strong
theme
of
despair
in
the
face
of
new
mechanized
warfare
that
tolkien
himself
had
experienced
in
the
trenches
of
world
war
i
.
the
development
of
a
specially
bred
orc
army
and
the
destruction
of
the
environment
to
aid
this
also
have
modern
resonances
and
the
effects
of
the
ring
on
its
users
evoke
the
modern
literature
of
drug
addiction
as
much
as
any
historic
quest
literature
.
nevertheless
tolkien
states
in
the
introduction
to
the
books
that
he
disliked
allegories
and
that
the
story
was
not
one20
and
it
would
be
irresponsible
to
dismiss
such
direct
statements
on
these
matters
lightly
.
tolkien
had
already
completed
most
of
the
book
including
the
ending
in
its
entirety
before
the
first
nuclear
bombs
were
made
known
to
the
world
at
hiroshima
and
nagasaki
in
august
1945
.
while
tolkien
plausibly
denied
any
specific
'nuclear
'
reference
it
is
clear
that
the
ring
has
broad
applicability
to
the
concept
of
absolute
power
and
its
effects
and
that
the
plot
hinges
on
the
view
that
anyone
who
seeks
to
gain
absolute
worldly
power
will
inevitably
be
corrupted
by
it
.
some
also
say
there
is
also
clear
evidence
that
one
of
the
main
subtexts
of
the
story
â
the
passing
of
a
mythical
``
golden
age
''
â
was
influenced
not
only
by
arthurian
legend
but
also
by
tolkien
's
contemporary
anxieties
about
the
growing
encroachment
of
urbanisation
and
industrialisation
into
the
``
traditional
''
english
lifestyle
and
countryside
.
the
concept
of
the
``
ring
of
power
''
itself
is
also
present
in
plato
's
republic
and
in
the
story
of
gyges
'
ring
a
story
often
compared
to
the
book
of
job
.
many
however
believe
tolkien
's
most
likely
source
was
the
norse
tale
of
sigurd
the
volsung
.
some
locations
and
characters
were
inspired
by
tolkien
's
childhood
in
sarehole
then
a
worcestershire
village
now
part
of
birmingham
and
birmingham
.
critical
response
tolkien
's
work
has
received
mixed
reviews
since
its
inception
ranging
from
terrible
to
excellent
.
recent
reviews
in
various
media
have
been
in
a
majority
highly
positive
.
on
its
initial
review
the
sunday
telegraph
felt
it
was
``
among
the
greatest
works
of
imaginative
fiction
of
the
twentieth
century
''
.
the
sunday
times
seemed
to
echo
these
sentiments
when
in
their
review
it
was
stated
that
``
the
english-speaking
world
is
divided
into
those
who
have
read
the
lord
of
the
rings
and
the
hobbit
and
those
who
are
going
to
read
them
.
''
the
new
york
herald
tribune
also
seemed
to
have
an
idea
of
how
popular
the
books
would
become
writing
in
its
review
that
they
were
``
destined
to
outlast
our
time
.
``
21
not
all
original
reviews
however
were
so
kind
.
new
york
times
reviewer
judith
shulevitz
criticized
the
``
pedantry
''
of
tolkien
's
literary
style
saying
that
he
``
formulated
a
high-minded
belief
in
the
importance
of
his
mission
as
a
literary
preservationist
which
turns
out
to
be
death
to
literature
itself
.
''
22
critic
richard
jenkyns
writing
in
the
new
republic
criticized
a
perceived
lack
of
psychological
depth
.
both
the
characters
and
the
work
itself
are
according
to
jenkyns
``
anemic
and
lacking
in
fiber
.
``
23
even
within
tolkien
's
social
group
the
inklings
reviews
were
mixed
.
hugo
dyson
was
famously
recorded
as
saying
during
one
of
tolkien
's
readings
to
the
group
``
oh
no
not
another
fucking
elf
''
24
however
another
inkling
c.s
.
lewis
had
very
different
feelings
writing
``
here
are
beauties
which
pierce
like
swords
or
burn
like
cold
iron
.
here
is
a
book
which
will
break
your
heart
.
''
several
other
authors
in
the
genre
however
seemed
to
agree
more
with
dyson
than
lewis
.
science-fiction
author
david
brin
criticized
the
books
for
what
he
perceived
to
be
their
unquestioning
devotion
to
a
traditional
elitist
social
structure
their
positive
depiction
of
the
slaughter
of
the
opposing
forces
and
their
romantic
backward-looking
worldview.25
michael
moorcock
another
famous
science
fiction
and
fantasy
author
is
also
a
fervent
detractor
of
the
lord
of
the
rings
.
in
his
essay
``
epic
pooh
''
he
equates
tolkien
's
work
to
winnie-the-pooh
and
criticizes
it
and
similar
works
for
their
perceived
merry
england
point
of
view.26
incidentally
moorcock
met
both
tolkien
and
lewis
in
his
teens
and
claims
to
have
liked
them
personally
even
though
he
does
not
admire
them
on
artistic
grounds
.
more
recently
critical
analysis
has
focused
on
tolkien
's
experiences
in
the
first
world
war
writers
such
as
john
garth
in
'tolkien
and
the
great
war
'
janet
brennan
croft
and
tom
shippey
all
look
in
detail
at
this
aspect
and
compare
the
imagery
mental
landscape
and
traumas
in
lord
of
the
rings
with
those
experienced
by
soldiers
in
the
trenches
and
the
history
of
the
great
war
.

ralph
bakshi
the
first
part
of
what
was
originally
intended
to
be
a
two-part
adaptation
of
the
story
hence
its
original
title
the
lord
of
the
rings
part
1
.
it
covers
the
fellowship
of
the
ring
and
part
of
the
two
towers
.
the
second
the
return
of
the
king
1980
was
an
animated
television
special
by
rankin-bass
who
had
produced
a
similar
version
of
the
hobbit
1977
.
the
third

director
peter

the

film
trilogy
produced
by

2002
and
the
lord
of
the
rings
the
return
of
the
king
2003
.
the
live-action
film
trilogy
has
done
much
in
particular
to
bring
the
book
into
the
public
consciousness.9
there
have
been
four
stage
productions
based
on
the
book
.
three
original
full-length
stage
adaptations
of
the
fellowship
of

2001
the
two

2002
and
the

influences
on
the
fantasy
genre
following
the
massive
success
of
the
lord
of
the
rings
tolkien
considered
a
sequel
entitled
the
new
shadow
in
which
the
men
of
gondor
turn
to
dark
cults
and
consider
an
uprising
against
aragorn
's
son
eldarion
.
tolkien
decided
not
to
do
it
and
the
incomplete
story
can
be
found
in
the
peoples
of
middle-earth
.
tolkien
returned
to
finish
his
mythology
which
was
published
in
novel
form
posthumously
by
christopher
tolkien
in
1977
and
the
remaining
information
of
his
legendarium
was
published
through
unfinished
tales
1980
and
the
history
of
middle-earth
a
12
volume
series
published
from
1983
to
1996
of
which
the
peoples
of
middle-earth
is
part
.
nonetheless
the
enormous
popularity
of
tolkien
's
epic
saga
greatly
expanded
the
demand
for
fantasy
fiction
.
largely
thanks
to
the
lord
of
the
rings
the
genre
flowered
throughout
the
1960s
.
many
other
books
in
a
broadly
similar
vein
were
published
including
the
earthsea
books
of
ursula
k.
le
guin
the
thomas
covenant
novels
of
stephen
r.
donaldson
and
in
the
case
of
the
gormenghast
books
by
mervyn
peake
and
the
worm
ouroboros
by
e.
r.
eddison
rediscovered
.
source
it
also
strongly
influenced
the
role
playing
game
industry
which
achieved
popularity
in
the
1970s
with
dungeons
dragons
.
dungeons
dragons
features
many
races
found
in
the
lord
of
the
rings
most
notably
the
presence
of
halflings
elves
dwarves
half-elves
orcs
and
dragons
.
however
gary
gygax
lead
designer
of
the
game
maintains
that
he
was
influenced
very
little
by
the
lord
of
the
rings
stating
that
he
included
these
elements
as
a
marketing
move
to
draw
on
the
then-popularity
of
the
work.32
the
lord
of
the
rings
also
has
influenced
magic
the
gathering
.
the
lord
of
the
rings
has
also
influenced
the
creation
of
various
video
games
including
baldur
's
gate
everquest
the
elder
scrolls
neverwinter
nights
and
the
warcraft
series33
as
well
as
video
games
set
in
middle-earth
itself
.
as
in
all
artistic
fields
a
great
many
lesser
derivatives
of
the
more
prominent
works
appeared
.
the
term
``
tolkienesque
''
is
used
in
the
genre
to
refer
to
the
oft-used
and
abused
storyline
of
the
lord
of
the
rings
a
group
of
adventurers
embarking
on
a
quest
to
save
a
magical
fantasy
world
from
the
armies
of
an
evil
``
dark
lord
''
and
is
a
testament
to
how
much
the
popularity
of
these
books
has
increased
since
many
critics
initially
decried
it
as
being
``
wagner
for
children
''
a
reference
to
the
ring
cycle
â
an
especially
interesting
commentary
in
light
of
a
possible
interpretation
of
the
books
as
a
christian
response
to
wagner.34
the
work
has
also
had
an
influence
upon
such
science
fiction
authors
as
isaac
asimov
and
arthur
c.
clarke
.
in
fact
clarke
who
compared
it
to
frank
herbert
's
dune35
makes
a
reference
to
mount
doom
in
his
work
2061
odyssey
three.citation

the
lord
of
the

has
had
a
profound
and
wide-ranging
impact
on
popular
culture
from
its
publication
in
the
1950s
but
especially
throughout
the
1960s
and
1970s
where
young
people
embraced
it
as
a
countercultural

its
influence
has
been
vastly
extended
in
