writing
tolkien
did
not
originally
intend
to
write
a
sequel
to
the
hobbit
and
instead
wrote
several
other
children
's
tales
including
roverandom
and
farmer
giles
of
ham
.
as
his
main
work
tolkien
began
to
outline
the
history
of
arda
telling
tales
of
the
silmarils
and
many
other
stories
of
how
the
races
and
situations
that
we
read
about
in
the
lord
of
the
rings
trilogy
came
to
be
.
tolkien
died
before
he
could
complete
and
put
together
the
silmarillion
but
his
son
christopher
tolkien
edited
his
father
's
work
filled
in
gaps
and
published
it
in
1977
.
tolkien
had
a
deep
desire
to
write
a
mythology
for
england
especially
after
his
horrific
experiences
during
the
first
world
war
.
he
was
also
influenced
by
the
effects
of
continued
industrialisation
where
he
saw
much
of
the
england
he
loved
passing
away
and
became
aware
of
the
immense
evil
in
the
world
.
thus
to
understand
his
writings
we
must
be
aware
of
how
tolkien
the
scholar
influences
tolkien
the
author
.
his
writing
of
this
mythology
emerges
as
an
oxford
philologist
well
acquainted
with
northern
european
medieval
literature
including
the
great
mythic
works
such
as
the
hervarar
saga
the
vãlsunga
saga
the
influential
beowulf
as
well
as
other
old
norse
old
and
middle
english
texts
.
he
was
also
inspired
by
non-germanic
works
such
as
the
finnish
epic
kalevala
.
a
man
who
had
created
his
first
language
by
the
age
of
seven
he
was
driven
by
a
desire
to
write
a
mythology
for
england
influenced
by
his
exposure
and
expertise
of
these
ancient
traditions
.
the
need
for
such
a
myth
was
often
a
topic
of
conversation
in
his
meetings
with
the
inklings
fellow
oxford
scholars
who
have
been
described
as
christian
romantics
meeting
weekly
and
discussing
icelandic
myths
and
their
own
unpublished
compositions
.
tolkien
agreed
with
one
of
the
other
members
of
the
group
c.s
.
lewis
that
if
there
were
no
adequate
myths
for
england
then
they
would
have
to
write
their
own
.
tolkien
's
work
has
been
commonly
interpreted
in
this
light
.
persuaded
by
his
publishers
he
started
'a
new
hobbit
'
in
december
1937
.
after
several
false
starts
the
story
of
the
one
ring
soon
emerged
and
the
book
mutated
from
being
a
sequel
to
the
hobbit
to
being
in
theme
more
of
a
sequel
to
the
unpublished
silmarillion
.
the
idea
of
the
first
chapter
a
long-expected
party
arrived
fully-formed
although
the
reasons
behind
bilbo
's
disappearance
and
the
significance
of
the
ring
did
not
arrive
along
with
the
title
the
lord
of
the
rings
until
spring
1938
.
originally
he
was
going
to
write
another
story
in
which
bilbo
had
used
up
all
his
treasure
and
was
looking
for
another
adventure
to
gain
more
however
he
remembered
the
ring
and
the
powers
it
had
and
decided
to
write
about
that
instead
.
he
started
to
write
it
with
bilbo
as
the
main
character
but
decided
that
the
story
was
too
serious
to
use
the
fun
loving
hobbit
so
tolkien
looked
to
use
a
member
of
bilbo
's
family
.
he
thought
about
using
bilbo
's
son
but
this
generated
some
difficult
questions
where
was
his
wife
how
could
bilbo
let
his
son
go
into
that
kind
of
danger
so
he
looked
for
an
alternate
character
to
carry
the
ring
.
in
greek
legend
it
was
a
hero
's
nephew
that
gained
the
item
of
power
and
so
into
existence
came
the
hobbit
frodo
.
writing
was
slow
due
to
tolkien
's
perfectionism
and
was
frequently
interrupted
by
his
obligations
as
an
examiner
and
other
academic
duties
.
in
fact
the
first
sentence
of
the
hobbit
was
written
on
a
blank
page
a
student
had
left
on
an
exam
paper
that
tolkien
was
grading
``
in
a
hole
in
the
ground
there
lived
a
hobbit
''
.
he
seems
to
have
abandoned
the
book
during
most
of
1943
and
only
re-started
it
in
april
1944
.
this
effort
was
written
as
a
serial
for
christopher
tolkien
and
c.s
.
lewis
the
former
would
be
sent
copies
of
chapters
as
they
were
written
while
he
was
serving
in
africa
in
the
royal
air
force
.
he
made
another
push
in
1946
and
showed
a
copy
of
the
manuscript
to
his
publishers
in
1947
.
the
story
was
effectively
finished
the
next
year
but
tolkien
did
not
finish
revising
earlier
parts
of
the
work
until
1949
.
a
dispute
with
his
publishers
allen
and
unwin
led
to
the
book
being
offered
to
collins
in
1950
.
he
intended
the
silmarillion
itself
largely
unrevised
at
this
point
to
be
published
along
with
the
lord
of
the
rings
but
allen
and
unwin
were
unwilling
to
do
this
.
after
his
contact
at
collins
milton
waldman
expressed
the
belief
that
the
lord
of
the
rings
itself
'urgently
needed
cutting
'
he
eventually
demanded
that
they
publish
the
book
in
1952
.
they
did
not
do
so
and
so
tolkien
wrote
to
allen
and
unwin
saying
``
i
would
gladly
consider
the
publication
of
any
part
of
the
stuff
''
.
some
locations
and
characters
were
inspired
by
tolkien
's
childhood
in
sarehole
then
a
warwickshire
village
now
part
of
birmingham
and
in
birmingham
itself
.

and

in

slightly
later
in

states
.
the
return
of
the
king
was
especially
delayed
.
he
did
not
however
much
like
the
title
the
return
of
the
king
believing
it
gave
away
too
much
of
the
storyline
.
he
had
originally
suggested
the
war
of
the
ring
which
was
dismissed
by
his
publishers
.
the
books
were
published
under
a
'profit-sharing
'
arrangement
where
tolkien
would
not
receive
an
advance
or
royalties
until
the
books
had
broken
even
but
after
then
take
a
large
share
of

profits

an
index
to
the
entire
3-volume
set

end
of

was
promised
in
the
first
volume

however
this
proved
impractical
to
compile
in
a
reasonable
timescale
.
later
in
1966
four
indices
which
were
not
compiled
by
tolkien
were
added
to
the
return
of
the
king
.
because
the
three-volume
binding
was
so
widely
distributed
the
work
is
usually
referred
to
as
the
lord
of
the
rings
``

.
tolkien
himself
made
use
of
the
term
``
trilogy
''
for
the
work
though
he
did
at
other
times
consider
this
incorrect
as
it
was
written
and
conceived
as
a

in
the
early
1960s
donald
a.
wollheim
science
fiction
editor
of
the
paperback
publisher
ace
books
realized
that
the
lord
of
the
rings
was
not
protected
in
the
united
states
under
american
copyright
law
because
the
us
hardcover
edition
had
been
bound
from
pages
printed
in
the
uk
for
the
british
edition
.
ace
books
proceeded
to
publish
an
edition
unauthorized
by
tolkien
and
without
compensation
to
him
.
tolkien
made
this
plain
to
us
fans
who
wrote
to
him
.
grass-roots
pressure
became
so
great
that
ace
books
withdrew
their
edition
and
made
a
nominal
payment
to
tolkien
well
below
what
he
might
have
been
due
in
an
appropriate
publication
.
however
this
poor
beginning
was
overshadowed
when
an
authorized
edition
followed
from
ballantine
books
to
tremendous
commercial
success
.
by
the
mid-1960s
the
books
due
to
their
wide
exposure
on
the
american
public
stage
had
become
a
true
cultural
phenomenon
.
the
second
edition
of
the
lord
of
the
rings
dates
from
this
time
tolkien
undertook
various
textual
revisions
to
produce
a
version
of
the
book
that
would
have
a
valid
u.s.
copyright
.
the
books
have
been
translated
with
various
degrees
of
success
into
dozens
of
other
languages
.
tolkien
an
expert
in
philology
examined
many
of
these
translations
and
had
comments
on
each
that
illuminate
both
the
translation
process
and
his
work
.
the
enormous
popular
success
of
tolkien
's
epic
saga
greatly
expanded
the
demand
for
fantasy
fiction
.
largely
thanks
to
the
lord
of
the
rings
the
genre
flowered
throughout
the
1960s
.
many
well-written
books
of
this
genre
were
published
comparable
works
include
the

books
of

books
by
mervyn

and
the

it
also
strongly
influenced
the
role
playing
game
industry
that
achieved
popularity
in
the
1970s
with
dungeons
dragons
which
featured
many
creatures
that
could
be
found
in
tolkien
's
books
.
as
in
all
artistic
fields
a
great
many
lesser
derivatives

the
more
prominent
works
appeared
.
the
term
``
tolkienesque
''
is
used
in
the
genre
to
refer
to
the
oft-used
and
abused
storyline
of

of
adventurers
embarking

magic
is
utilised
freely
in

and
may
be
found
not
only
in
the
incantations
of
wizards
but
in
the
weapons
and
tools
of
warriors
and
craftspeople
in
the
perceptions
and
abilities
of
heroes
and
in
the
natural
world
itself
.
tolkien
did
repeatedly
insist
that
his
works
were
not
an
allegory
of
any
kind
and
even
though
his
thoughts
on
the
matter
are
mentioned
in
the
introduction
of
the
book
there
has
been
heavy
speculation
about
the
ruling
ring
being
an
allegory
for
the
atom
bomb
.
however
tolkien
had
already
completed
most
of
the
book
and
planned
the
ending
in
entirety
before
the
first
atom
bombs
were
made
public
to
the
world
during
the
atomic
bombings
of
hiroshima
and
nagasaki
in
august
1945
.
however
there
is
a
strong
theme
of
despair
in
front
of
new
mechanized
warfare
that
tolkien
himself
had
experienced
in
the
trenches
of
world
war
one
.
the
development
of
a
specially
bred
orc
army
and
the
destruction
of
the
environment
to
aid
this
have
modern
resonances
.
nevertheless
the
author
's
own
opinion
on
the
matter
of
allegories
was
that
he
disliked
them
and
it
would
be
irresponsible
to
dismiss
such
direct
statements
on
these
matters
lightly
.
the
plot
of
the
lord
of
the
rings
builds
from
his
earlier
book
the
hobbit
and
more
obliquely
from
the
history
in
the
silmarillion
which
contains
events
to
which
the
characters
of
the
lord
of
the
rings
look
back
upon
in
the
book
.
the
hobbits
become
embroiled
in
great
events
that
threaten
their
entire
world
as
sauron
an
evil
spirit
attempts
to
regain
the
lost
one
ring
which
will
restore
him
to
full
potency
.

criticism
the
book
was
characterized
as
``
juvenile
balderdash
''
by
american
critic
edmund
wilson
in
his
essay
``
oo
those
awful
orcs
''
and
in
1961
philip

somewhat
prematurely
that
it

``

auden
also
criticized
the
book
in
a
1968
critical
quarterly
article
``
good
and
evil

the
lord
of
the
rings
''
objecting
to
tolkien
's
conception
of
sentient
species
that
are
intrinsically
evil
without
possibility
of
redemption
.
this
is
a
criticism
often
directed
at
dungeons
and
dragons-like
fantasy
worlds
as
well
as
at
fantasy
literature
in
general
and
a
criticism
that
tolkien
himself
increasingly
struggled
with
during
his
last
years
.
on
the
other
hand
in
a
1956
new
york
times
book
review
``
at
the
end
of
the
quest

''
auden
also
called
the
book
``
a
masterpiece
of
its
genre
''
that
``
succeeded
where
milton
failed
''
in
depicting
an
epic
battle
between
good
and
evil
and
wrote
that
it
``
never
violated
''
the
``
reader
's
sense
of
the
credible
.
''
furthermore
like
almost
every
fantasy
book
lord
of
the
rings
is
also
accused
by
evangelicals
for
its
alleged
references
to
quasi-pagan
elements
and
``
occultism
''
.
science-fiction
author
david
brin
has
criticized
the
books
for
unquestioning
devotion
to
a
traditional
elitist
social
structure
their
positive
depiction
of
the
slaughter
of
the
opposing
forces
and
their
romantic
backward-looking
worldview

these
criticisms
often
supply
also
similar
accusations
about
racism

wrote
a
long
and
piercing
critique
of
the
book

writer
criticised
tolkien

``

''
mieville
is
also
a
detractor
of
later
fantasy
which
draws
heavily
upon
tolkien
's
work
based
on
the
idea
that
such
work
is
cliche

contemplated
numerous
alternative
titles
for
the
lord
of

a
full-fledged
live-action
adaptation
of

with
peter
jackson
as

eventually
miramax
became
uneasy
with
the
sheer
scope
of
the
proposed
project
and
wanted
to
combine
the
suggested
two
films
into
one
.
peter
jackson
struck
a
deal
with
miramax
that
if
he
could
not
find
a
fresh
studio
to
back
the
project
he
would
walk
away
and
leave
the
rights
and
all
the
work
so
far
completed
with
miramax
.
however
in

cinema
assumed
production
responsibility
unexpectedly
announcing
that
it
would
mount
three
not
just
two
films
while
miramax
executives
bob

harvey

retained
on-screen

for
best
long-form

presentation

although
some
have
criticized
these
films
because
they
have
altered
the
story
somewhat
and
arguably
have
a
noticeably
different
tone
from
tolkien
's
original
vision
others
have
hailed
them
as
remarkable
achievements
.
peter
jackson
has
defended
his
changes
by
stating
that
he
views
the
films
as
merely
one
man
's
interpretation
