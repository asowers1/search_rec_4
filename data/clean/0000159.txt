lively
is
an
odd
word
for
something
called
dead
man
's
chest
but
lively
it

.
you

a

the
worst
kind
of
sequel
--
the
kind
that
exists
only
to
give
you
more-more-more
of
what
you
liked
the
first
time
around
without
ever
justifying
its
own
existence

this
lavish

high

somewhat
mindful

the
the
lackluster
movie
reviews
in
the
press
.
having
said
that
i
have
no
idea
what
crawled
up
the
collective
aes
of
the
majority
of
the
movie
critics
and
got
caught
in
their

.
i
guess
some
of
them
have
no
sense
of
fun
or
something

hollywood

got
the

nighthumor
weak
story
line

simplistic
plodding

thought
i
would
give
the
second
a
chance
to
redeem
the
first

not

mention
the
sublime
johnny
depp
.
big
mistake
.
save
your
money
and
the
hours
of
lifetime
you
must
commit
to
viewing
this
trash
.
my
money
and
my
time
are
gone
but
you
have
a
choice
.
make
the
right
choice
and
see
another
movie
like
superman
returns
...
.yeah
dead
man
's

is
that
bad
