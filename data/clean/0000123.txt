including
famed

renowned

working
together
in
the

in

announced
that

production
design
for
the

took
several
years
.
the
film
had
two
different
production
designers
and
two
separate
art
departments
one
of
which
focused
on
the
flora
and
fauna
of
pandora
and
another
that
created
human
machines
and
human
factors.64
in
september
2006
cameron
was
announced
to
be
using
his
own
reality
camera
system
to
film
in
3-d
.
the
system
would
use
two
high-definition
cameras
in
a
single
camera
body
to
create
depth
perception.65
fox
was
wavering
because
of
its
painful
experience
with
cost
overruns
and
delays
on
cameron
's
previous
picture
titanic
even
though
cameron
rewrote
avatar
's
script
to
combine
several
characters
together
and
offered
to
cut
his
fee
in
case
the
film
flopped.55
cameron
installed
a
traffic
light
with
the
amber
signal
lit
outside
of
co-producer
jon
landau
's
office
to
represent
the
film
's
uncertain
future.55
in
mid-2006
fox
told
cameron
``
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
they
were
passing
on
this
film
''
so
he
began
shopping
it
around
to
other
studios
and
showed
his
proof-of-concept
to
dick
cook
then
chairman
of
the
walt
disney
studios.55
however
when
disney
attempted
to
take
over
fox
exercised
its
right
of
first
refusal.55
in
october
2006
fox
finally
agreed
to
commit
to
making
avatar
after
ingenious
media
agreed
to
back
the
film
which
reduced
fox
's
financial
exposure
to
less
than
half
of
the
film
's
official
237
million
budget.55
after
fox
accepted
avatar
one
skeptical
fox
executive
shook
his
head
and
told
cameron
and
landau
``
i
do
n't
know
if
we
're

described
the

as
``

the

cameron
said
his
inspiration
was
``
every

that
he
was

he
acknowledged
that

shares
themes
with
the
films
at
play
in
the
fields
of
the
lord
the
emerald
forest
and
princess
mononoke
which
feature
clashes

in

2007
interview
with

cameron
was
asked
about
the
meaning
of
the
term
avatar
to
which
he
replied
``
it
's
an
incarnation
of
one
of
the
hindu
gods
taking
a
flesh
form
.
in
this
film
what
that
means
is
that
the
human
technology
in
the

is
capable
of
injecting
a
human

jake
's
avatar
and
neytiri
.
one
of
the
inspirations
for
the
look
of
the
na'vi
came
from
a
dream
that
cameron
's
mother
had
told
him
about.69
the
look
of
the
na'vi
â
the
humanoids
indigenous
to
pandora
â
was
inspired
by
a
dream
that
cameron
's
mother
had
long
before
he
started
work
on
avatar
.
in
her
dream
she
saw
a
blue-skinned
woman
12
feet
4
m
tall
which
he
thought
was
``
kind
of
a
cool
image
''
.69
also
he
said
``
i
just
like
blue
.
it
's
a
good
color
...
plus
there
's
a
connection
to
the
hindu
deities72
which
i
like
conceptually
.
``
73
he
included
similar
creatures
in
his
first
screenplay
written
in
1976
or
1977
which
featured
a
planet
with
a
native
population
of
``
gorgeous
''
tall
blue
aliens
.
the
na'vi
were
based
on
them.69
for
the
love
story
between
characters
jake
and
neytiri
cameron
applied
a
star-crossed
love
theme
and
acknowledged
its
similarity
to
the
pairing
of
jack
and
rose
from
his
film
titanic
.
an
interviewer
stated
``
both
couples
come
from
radically
different
cultures
that
are
contemptuous
of
their
relationship
and
are
forced
to
choose
sides
between
the
competing
communities
.
``
74
cameron
felt
that
whether
or
not
the
jake
and
neytiri
love
story
would
be
perceived
as
believable
partially
hinged
on
the
physical
attractiveness
of
neytiri
's
alien
appearance
which
was
developed
by
considering
her
appeal
to
the
all-male
crew
of
artists.75
though
cameron
felt
jake
and
neytiri
do
not
fall
in
love
right
away
their
portrayers
worthington
and
saldana
felt
the
characters
do
.
cameron
said
the
two
actors
``
had
a
great
chemistry
''
during
filming.74
pandora
's
floating
``
hallelujah
mountains
''
were
inspired
in
part
by
the
chinese
huang
shan
mountains
pictured.76
for
the
film
's
floating
``
hallelujah
mountains
''
the
designers
drew
inspiration
from
``
many
different
types
of
mountains
but
mainly
the
karst
limestone
formations
in
china
.
``
77
according
to
production
designer
dylan
cole
the
fictional
floating
rocks
were
inspired
by
mount
huang
also
known
as
huangshan
guilin
zhangjiajie
among
others
around
the
world.77
director
cameron
had
noted
the
influence
of
the
chinese
peaks
on
the
design
of
the
floating
mountains.78
to
create
the
interiors
of
the
human
mining
colony
on
pandora
production
designers
visited
the
noble
clyde
boudreaux79
oil
platform
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
during
june
2007
.
they
photographed
measured
and
filmed
every
aspect
of
the
platform
which
was
later
replicated
on-screen
with
photorealistic
cgi
during
post-production.80
cameron
said
that
he
wanted
to
make
``
something
that
has
this
spoonful
of
sugar
of
all
the
action
and
the
adventure
and
all
that
''
but
also
have
a
conscience
``
that
maybe
in
the
enjoying
of
it
makes
you
think
a
little
bit
about
the
way
you
interact
with
nature
and
your
fellow
man
''
.
he
added
that
``
the
na'vi
represent
something
that
is
our
higher
selves
or
our
aspirational
selves
what
we
would
like
to
think
we
are
''
and
that
even
though
there
are
good
humans
within
the
film
the
humans
``
represent
what
we
know
to
be
the
parts
of
ourselves
that
are
trashing
our
world
and
maybe
condemning
ourselves
to
a
grim
future
''
.81
cameron
acknowledges
that
avatar
implicitly
criticizes
the
united
states
'
role
in
the
iraq
war
and
the
impersonal
nature
of
mechanized
warfare
in
general
.
in
reference
to
the
use
of
the
term
shock
and
awe
in
the
film
cameron
said
``
we
know
what
it
feels
like
to
launch

we
do
n't

``
82
he
said
in
later
interviews
``
...
i
think
it
's
very
patriotic
to
question
a
system
that
needs
to
be
corralled

83
and
``
the
film
is
definitely
not
anti-american

filming
principal
photography
for

began
in
april
2007
in
los
angeles
and
wellington
new

.
cameron
described
the
film
as
a
hybrid
with
a
full
live-action
shoot
in
combination
with
computer-generated
characters
and
live
environments
.
``
ideally
at
the
end
of

the
audience
has
no
idea
which
they
're
looking
at

cameron
said
.
the
director
indicated
that
he
had
already
worked
four
months
on
nonprincipal
scenes
for
the
film.85
the
live
action
was
shot
with
a
modified
version
of
the
proprietary
digital
3-d
fusion
camera
system
developed
by
cameron
and
vince
pace.86
in
january
2007
fox
had
announced
that
3-d
filming
for
avatar
would
be
done
at
24
frames
per
second
despite
cameron
's
strong
opinion
that
a
3-d
film
requires
higher
frame
rate
to
make
strobing
less
noticeable.87
according
to
cameron
the
film
is
composed
of
60
computer-generated
elements
and
40
live
action
as
well
as
traditional
miniatures.88
motion-capture
photography
lasted
31
days
at
the
hughes
aircraft
stage
in
playa
vista
in
los

live
action
photography
began
in
october
2007
at
stone
street

in
wellington
new

and
was
scheduled
to
last
31
days.90
more
than
a
thousand
people
worked
on
the
production.89
in
preparation
of
the
filming
sequences
all
of
the
actors
underwent
professional
training
specific
to
their
characters
such
as
archery
horseback
riding
firearm
use
and
hand-to-hand
combat
.
they
received
language
and
dialect
training
in
the
na'vi
language
created
for
the
film.91
before
shooting
the
film
cameron
also
sent
the
cast
to
the
hawaiian
tropical
rainforests92
to
get
a
feel
for
a
rainforest
setting
before
shooting
on
the
soundstage.91
during
filming
cameron
made
use
of
his
virtual
camera
system
a
new
way
of
directing
motion-capture
filmmaking
.
the
system
shows
the
actors
'
virtual
counterparts
in
their
digital
surroundings
in
real
time
allowing
the
director
to
adjust
and
direct
scenes
just
as
if
shooting
live
action
.
according
to
cameron
``
it
's
like
a
big
powerful
game
engine
.
if
i
want
to
fly
through
space
or
change
my
perspective
i
can
.
i
can
turn
the
whole
scene
into
a
living
miniature
and
go
through
it
on
a
50
to
1
scale
.
``
93
using
conventional
techniques
the
complete
virtual
world
can
not
be
seen
until
the
motion-capture
of
the
actors
is
complete
.
cameron
said
this
process
does
not
diminish
the
value
or
importance
of
acting
.
on
the
contrary
because
there
is
no
need
for
repeated
camera
and
lighting
setups
costume
fittings
and
make-up
touch-ups
scenes
do
not
need
to
be
interrupted
repeatedly.94
cameron
described
the
system
as
a
``
form
of
pure
creation
where
if
you
want
to
move
a
tree
or
a
mountain
or
the
sky
or
change
the
time
of
day
you
have
complete
control
over
the
elements
''
.95
cameron
gave
fellow
directors
steven
spielberg
and
peter
jackson
a
chance
to
test
the
new
technology.68
spielberg
said
``
i
like
to
think
of
it
as
digital
makeup
not
augmented
animation
...
motion
capture
brings
the
director
back
to
a
kind
of
intimacy
that
actors
and
directors
only
know
when
they
're
working
in
live
theater
.
``
94
spielberg
and
george
lucas
were
also
able
to
visit
the
set
to
watch
cameron
direct
with
the
equipment.96
to
film
the
shots
where
cgi
interacts
with
live
action
a
unique
camera
referred
to
as
a
``
simulcam
''
was
used
a
merger
of
the
3-d
fusion
camera
and
the
virtual
camera
systems
.
while
filming
live
action
in
real
time
with
the
simulcam
the
cgi
images
captured
with
the
virtual
camera
or
designed
from
scratch
are
superimposed
over
the
live
action
images
as
in
augmented
reality
and
shown
on
a
small
monitor
making
it
possible
for
the
director
to
instruct
the
actors
how
to
relate
to
the
virtual
material
in
the
scene.91
visual
effects
cameron
pioneered
a
specially
designed
camera
built
into
a
6-inch
boom
that
allowed
the
facial
expressions
of
the
actors
to
be
captured
and
digitally
recorded
for
the
animators
to
use
later.97
a
number
of
innovative
visual
effects
techniques
were
used
during
production
.
according
to
cameron
work
on
the
film
had
been
delayed
since
the
1990s
to
allow
the
techniques
to
reach
the
necessary
degree
of
advancement
to
adequately
portray
his
vision
of
the
film.1718
the
director
planned
to
make
use
of
photorealistic
computer-generated
characters
created
using
new
motion
capture
animation
technologies
he
had
been
developing
in
the
14
months
leading
up
to
december
2006.93
innovations
include
a
new
system
for
lighting
massive
areas
like
pandora
's
jungle98
a
motion-capture
stage
or
``
volume
''
six
times
larger
than
any
previously
used
and
an
improved
method
of
capturing
facial
expressions

to
achieve
the
face
capturing
actors
wore
individually
made
skull
caps
fitted
with
a
tiny
camera
positioned
in

of
the
actors
'
faces
the
information
collected
about
their
facial
expressions
and
eyes
is
then
transmitted
to
computers.99
according
to
cameron
the
method
allows
the
filmmakers
to
transfer
100
of
the
actors
'
physical
performances
to
their
digital
counterparts.100
besides
the
performance
capture
data
which
were
transferred
directly
to
the
computers
numerous
reference
cameras
gave
the
digital
artists
multiple
angles
of
each
performance.101
a
technically
challenging
scene
was
near
the
end
of
the
film
when
the
computer-generated
neytiri
held
the
live
action
jake
in
human
form
and
attention
was
given
to
the
details
of
the
shadows

reflected
light
between
them.102
the
lead
visual

company
was
weta
digital
in
wellington
new

at
one
point
employing
900
people
to
work
on
the
film.103
because
of
the
huge
amount
of
data
which
needed
to
be
stored
cataloged
and
available
for

even
on

a

discussing
the
writing
process
cameron
stated
that
although
friedman
jaffa
and
silver
and
salerno
are
each
co-writing
one
sequel
with
him
they
at
first
worked
all
together
for
several
months
on
all
three
scripts
with
him
without
knowing
which
movie
he
was
going
to
assign
to
each
``
we
whiteboarded
out
every
scene
in
every
film
together
and
i
didnât
assign
each
writer
which
film
they
were
going
to
work
on
until
the
last
day
.
i
knew
if
i
assigned
them
their
scripts
ahead
of
time
theyâd
tune
out
every
time
we
were
talking
about
the
other
movie
.
``
326327
``
we
sat
in
the
writing
room
for
five
months
eight
hours
a
day
and
we
worked
out
every
beat
of
the
story
across
all
three
films
so
it
all
connects
as
one
sort
of
three-film
saga
.
``

on

the
scheduled
release
dates
for
the
sequels
were
each
delayed
by
a
year
with
the
first
sequel
expected
to
be
released
in
december

cameron
called
the
writing
process
