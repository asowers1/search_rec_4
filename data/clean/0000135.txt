``
collide
with
destiny
''
titanic
is
a
movie
i
've
seen
countless
times
since
i
was
a
little
kid
and
it
came
out
.
this
movie
is
one
that
seems
to
polarize
people
to
extremes
.
some
love
it
and
will
call
it
one
of
the
best
movies
they
've
seen
and
others
will
hate
it
and
label
it
one
of
the
worst
.
as
far
as
where
i
stand
on
it
today
i
still
believe
it
is
a
very
good
film
that
benefits
from
marvelous
special
effects
.
jack
wins
his
way
onto
the
titanic
in
a
poker
game
and
runs
into
first
class
rich
girl
rose
when
she
is
hanging
off
the
end
of
the
ship
apparently
about
to
commit
suicide
.
jack
saves
her
and
they
start
spending
a
lot
of
time
together
which
really
pisses
off
rose
's
rich
but
unpleasant
fiancé
cal
hockley
.
the
story
is
told
by
the
102
year
old
rose
as
treasure
seeker
brock
lovett
searches
for
a
diamond
that
was
given
to
rose
by
cal
on
the
boat.the
movie
has
its
share
of
problems
.
the
dialogue
at
times
can
be
corny
as
can
the
actions
.
the
acting
while
serviceable
most
of
the
time
has
some
terrible
moments
especially
from
billy
zane
and
bill
paxton
.
also
the
film
suffers
slightly
from
its
long
run
time
.
it
's
not
something
that
bothers
me
a
great
deal
but
had
the
film
been
cut
by
something
like
20
or
30
minutes
it
would
have
flowed
a
lot
better.titanic
is
n't
james
cameron
's
best
film
but
it
is
a
majestic
and
epic
one
.
i
like
leonardo
dicaprio
and
kate
winslet
as
jack
and
rose
and
i
also
really
liked
kathy
bates
as
a
first
class
passenger
that
has
just
come
into
her
money
.
this
is
n't
one
of
the
best
films
ever
but
it
's
at
times
fun
sad
infuriating
and
joyful
.
there
's
an
emotional
rollercoaster
going
on
here
.

i
saw
this
on
dvd
for
the
first
time
in
2014
as
part
of
a
dvd
binge
weekend
during
4
days
of
snow
.
i
liked
it
because
it
has
a
real
story
--
although
in
retrospect
the
poor
rich
girl
who
was
going
to
kill
herself
because
her
fiance
was
too
rich
or
too
controlling
was
a
little
over
the
top
but
this
is
from
the
perspective
of
a
woman
me
who
has
lived
all
that
drama
decades
ago
.
the
sets
were
outstanding
.
really
captured
the
sense
of
what
it
was
like
to
be
trapped
on
a
sinking
ship
--
talk
about
being
trapped
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
blue
sea
.
the
class
warfare
was
interesting
.
still
fighting
that
.
nit
pick
why
did
rose
keep
the
multi-million
dollar
necklace
it
was
given
to
her
by
someone
she
hated
and
it
was
more
like
a
handcuff
.
and
then
why
did
she
dump
it
into
the
ocean
--
i
got
that
it
was
supposed
to
close
a
chapter
on
her
life
but
it
was
the
wrong
symbol
.
and
she
has
this
granddaughter
--
did
she
ever
think
maybe
the
granddaughter
could
use
a
little
help
paying
off
her
student
loans
as
i
say
those
are
nit
picks
it
was
a
good
movie
