narnia
fails
to
uphold
responsibility
to
book
fans
12
december
2005
by
zach-74
united
states
see
all
my
reviews
adapting
a
book
that
so
many
audience
members
have
read
and
cherish
is
surely
a
daunting
task
but
i
believe
it
is
also
a
great
responsibility
.
recently
peter
jackson
set
the
bar
pretty
high
in
this
regard
with
the
``
lord
of
the
rings
''
trilogy
.
unfortunately
adamson
's
``
narnia
''
was
n't
quite
up
to
snuff.i
count
myself
among
those
who
cherish
``
the
chronicles
of
narnia
''
having
read
them
as
a
child
and
having
re-read
``
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
''
in
eager
anticipation
of
the
film
.
in
my
opinion
this
film
adaptation
not
only
falls
short
but
does
a
disservice
to
the
audience
by
cheating
us
of
much
of
the
impact
and
wonder
of
the
original
books.here
are
the
general
categories
including
some
specific
examples
where
i
felt
the
film
did
n't
deliverscreen
adaptation
-
some
important
scenes
that
illustrated
character
dynamic
were
cut
short
making
later
behavior
and
motivation
seem
exaggerated
or
cliché
.
example
the
scene
where
edmund
meets
jadis
was
rushed
and
awkward
.
it
was
n't
even
demonstrated
that
the
turkish
delight
was
enchanted
in
order
to
manipulate
edmund
-
we
were
left
to
assume
that
his
allegiance
to
jadis
was
due
solely
to
avarice
also
in
the
book
the
mere
mention
of
the
name
``
aslan
''
for
the
first
time
was
an
event
that
had
an
important
impact
on
the
children
.
in
the
movie
this
impact
was
all
but
lost
as
these
subtler
points
were
sacrificed
to
save
screen
time
for
the
type
of
gruesome
battle
scenes
that
you
would
expect
from
a
``
fantasy
''
movie
but
in
this
case
did
n't
serve
to
advance
the
story
.
another
pulled
punch
in
the
book
the
scene
with
father
christmas
was
a
brilliant
omen
of
the
turning
of
the
tides
but
here
the
scene
seemed
out
of
place
and
just
downright
weird
.
they
might
as
well
have
run
into
the
easter
bunny.a
couple
of
outright
inventions
served
only
to
distract
us
from
the
magic
and
mystery
of
the
real
story
the
waterfall
scene
-
who
came
up
with
that
idea
the
cricket
ball
through
the
window
-
not
as
effective
as
the
original
story.casting
-
the
elder
siblings
were
mediocre
and
i
ca
n't
tell
if
tilda
swinton
was
just
awfully
directed
or
totally
miscast
.
in
the
book
jadis
was
a
noble
and
grand
enchantress
albeit
with
dastardly
aims
in
the
movie
she
was
shallow
petty
and
despicable
.
oh
and
liam
neeson
as
the
voice
of
aslan
the
lion
was
not
nearly
powerful
enough
--
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
roles
in
the
film
.
was
james
earl
jones
not
availabledirection
of
actors
'
performances
-
this
ties
in
with
my
comments
about
casting
above
.
performances
in
individual
scenes
seemed
disjointed
from
overall
character
motivations
and
some
character
interpretations
such
as
jadis
and
edmund
were
shallow
and
unsympathetic
.
where
was
the
charisma
that
would
have
made
jadis
's
character
believable
let
alone
have
enabled
her
to
amass
an
army
of
supporters
hairmake-up
-
jadis
sports
blonde
distractingly
annoying
dreadlocks
despite
her
otherwise
un-irie
nature
.
the
professor
's
hair
and
beard
looked
about
as
realistic
as
a
department
store
santa
and
the
main
centaur
's
make-up
also
stood
out
as
distractingly
awful.wardrobe
-
jadis
has
one
outfit
in
particular
that
looks
like
it
came
right
off
the
runway
of
a
bad
80
's
fashion
show
.
another
includes
an
atrocious
hat
shaped
like
a
giant
icicle
--
mr
.
freeze
from
batman
robin
would
have
had
hearts
in
his
eyes.special
effects
-
overall
special
effects
were
not
nearly
as
cleanly
integrated
as
weta
's
work
on
lotr
and
cohesion
was
lacking
.
for
example
the
cuts
between
live
action
and
cgi
wolves
were
painful
at
best
.
also
the
teeming
masses
of
bad-guys
all
looked
as
though
they
could
have
been
extras
in
the
orc
armies
of
lotr
.
mr.
tumnus
was
an
example
of
the
fact
that
jadis
's
supporters
were
comprised
of
otherwise
beneficent
creatures
that
she
'd
charmed
threatened
and
bullied
into
joining
her
.
here
they
were
unimaginatively
portrayed
as
one-dimensional
twisted
evil
fiends.cinematography
-
boring
all
the
visual
texture
and
lighting
of
a
made-for-tv
movie
.
due
to
my
disappointment
in
adamson
's
interpretation
of
this
work
and
in
the
execution
of
the
movie
that
resulted
i
rate
this
film
a
5
out
of
10
.
it
is
not
completely
devoid
of
entertainment
value
but
fails
to
uphold
the
responsibility
that
a
filmmaker
shoulders
when
adapting
so
well-known
and
well-loved
a
story
.
