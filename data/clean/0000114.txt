--
aeschylus
agamemnon
the
primroses
were
over
.
toward
the
edge
of
the
wood
where
the
ground
became
open
and
sloped
down
to
an
old
fence
and
a
brambly
ditch
beyond
only
a
few
fading
patches
of
pale
yellow
still
showed
among
the
dog
's
mercury
and
the
oak-tree
roots
.
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
the
upper
part
of
the
field
was
full
of
rabbit
holes
.
in
places
the
grass
was
gone
altogether
and
everywhere
there
were
clusters
of
dry
droppings
through
which
nothing
but
the
ragwort
would
grow
.
a
hundred
yards
away
at
the
bottom
of
the
slope
ran
the
brook
no
more
than
three
feet
wide
half
choked
with
kingcups
watercress
and
blue
brooklime
.
the
cart
track
crossed
by
a
brick
culvert
and
climbed
the
opposite
slope
to
a
five-barred
gate
in
the
thorn
hedge
.
the
gate
led
into
the
lane
.
the
may
sunset
was
red
in
clouds
and
there
was
still
half
an
hour
to
twilight
.
the
dry
slope
was
dotted
with
rabbits
--
some
nibbling
at
the
thin
grass
near
their
holes
others
pushing
further
down
to
look
for
dandelions
or
perhaps
a
cowslip
that
the
rest
had
missed
.
here
and
there
one
sat
upright
on
an
ant
heap
and
looked
about
with
ears
erect
and
nose
in
the
wind
.
but
a
blackbird
singing
undisturbed
on
the
outskirts
of
the
wood
showed
that
there
was
nothing
alarming
there
and
in
theother
direction
along
the
brook
all
was
plain
to
be
seen
empty
and
quiet
.
the
warren
was
at
peace
.
at
the
top
of
the
bank
close
to
the
wild
cherry
where
the
blackbird
sang
was
a
little
group
of
holes
almost
hidden
by
brambles
.
in
the
green
half-light
at
the
mouth
of
one
of
these
holes
two
rabbits
were
sitting
together
side
by
side
.
at
length
the
larger
of
the
two
came
out
slipped
along
the
bank
under
cover
of
the
brambles
and
so
down
into
the
ditch
and
up
into
the
field
.
a
few
moments
later
the
other
followed
.
the
first
rabbit
stopped
in
a
sunny
patch
and
scratched
his
ear
with
rapid
movements
of
his
hind
leg
.
although
he
was
a
yearling
and
still
below
fall
weight
he
had
not
the
harassed
look
of
most
``
outskirters
''
'
--
that
is
the
rank
and
file
of
ordinary
rabbits
in
their
first
year
who
lacking
either
aristocratic
parentage
or
unusual
size
and
strength
get
sat
on
by
their
elders
and
live
as
best
they
can
--
often
in
the
open
--
on
the
edge
of
their
warren
.
he
looked
as
though
he
knew
how
to
take
care
of
himself
.
there
was
a
shrewd
buoyant
air
about
him
as
he
sat
up
looked
around
and
rubbed
both
front
paws
over
his
nose
.
as
soon
as
he
was
satisfied
that
all
was
well
he
laid
back
his
ears
and
set
to
work
on
the
grass
.
his
companion
seemed
less
at
ease
.
he
was
small
with
wide
staring
eyes
and
a
way
of
raising
and
turning
his
head
which
suggested
not
so
much
caution
as
a
kind
of
ceaseless
nervous
tension
.
his
nose
moved
continually
and
when
a
bumblebee
flew
humming
to
a
thistle
bloom
behind
him
he
jumped
and
spun
round
with
a
start
that
sent
two
nearby
rabbits
scurrying
for
holes
before
the
nearest
a
buck
with
black-tipped
ears
recognized
him
and
returned
to
feeding
.
``
oh
it
's
only
fiver
''
said
the
black-tipped
rabbit
``
jumping
at
bluebottles
again
.
come
on
buckthorn
what
were
you
telling
me
''
''
fiver
''
said
the
other
rabbit
.
``
why
's
he
called
that
''
''
five
in
the
litter
you
know
he
was
the
last
--
and
the
smallest
.
you
'd
wonder
nothing
had
got
him
by
now
.
i
always
say
a
man
could
n't
see
him
and
a
fox
would
n't
want
him
.
still
i
admit
he
seems
to
be
able
to
keep
out
of
harm
's
way
.
''
the
small
rabbit
came
closer
to
his
companion
lolloping
on
long
hind
legs
.
``

's
go
a
bit

said
.
``
you
know
there
's
something
queer
about
the
warren
this
evening
although
i
ca
n't
tell
exactly
what
it
is
.
shall
we
go
down
to
the
brook
''
''
all
right
''
answered
hazel
``
and
you
can
find
me
a
cowslip
.
if
you
ca
n't
find
one
no
one
can
.
''
he
led
the
way
down
the
slope
his
shadow
stretching
behind
him
on
the
grass
.
they
reached
the
brook
and
began
nibbling
and
searching
close
beside
the
wheel
ruts
of
the
track
.
it
was
not
long
before
fiver
found
what
they
were
looking
for
.
cowslips
are
a
delicacy
among
rabbits
and
as
a
rule
there
are
very
few
left
by
late
may
in
the
neighborhood
of
even
a
small
warren
.
this
one
had
not
bloomed
and
its
flat
spread
of
leaves
was
almost
hidden
under
the
long
grass
.
they
were
just
sitting
on
it
when
two
larger
rabbits
came
running
across
from
the
other
side
of
the
nearby
cattle
wade
.
``
cowslip
''
said
one
.
``
all
right
--
just
leave
it
to
us
.
come
on
hurry
up
''
he
added
as
fiver
hesitated
.
``
you
heard
me
did
n't
you
''
''
fiver
found
it
toadflax
''
said
hazel
.
``
and
we
'll
eat
it
''
replied
toadflax
.
``
cowslips
are
for
owsla
--
do
n't
you
know
that
if
you
do
n't
we
can
easily
teach
you
.
''
fiver
had
already
turned
away
.
hazel
caught
him
up
by
the
culvert
.
``
i
'm
sick
and
tired
of
it
''
he
said
.
``
it
's
the
same
all
the
time
.
'these
are
my
claws
so
this
is
my
cowslip
.
'
'these
are
my
teeth
so
this
is
my
burrow
.
'
i
'll
tell
you
if
ever
i
get
into
the
owsla
i
'll
treat
outskirters
with
a
bit
of
decency
.
''
``
well
you
can
at
least
expect
to
be
in
the
owsla
one
day
''
answered
fiver
.
``
you
've
got
some
weight
coming
and
that
's
more
than
i
shall
ever
have

excellent
watership
down
is
one
of
the
best
in
classic
literature
.
it
is
a
novel
about
the
lives
of
a
small
group
of
rabbits
in
search
of
a
home
after
their
warren
is
destroyed
by
humans
.
in
the
book
the
leader
of
the
rabbits
called
hazel
and
his
friend
fiver
the
mystic
both
lead
their
gang
across
rivers
escaping
predators
and
humans
with
their
snares
and
traps
.
the
rabbits
finally
find
a
good
place
to
make
their
new
warren
and
after
doing
so
are
faced
with
the
problem
of
there
not
being
enough
rabbits
to
keep
the
warren
going
.
they
attempt
to
solve
the
problem
by
trying
to
steal
some
pet
rabbits
from
a
farm
nearby
.
when
that
doesnt
work
to
plan
they
decide
to
find
another
warren
and
to
convince
some
of
their
rabbits
to
come
to
the
new
warren
.
when
they
find
a
new
warren
they
find
it
under
the
tyrannical
reign
of
a
huge
rabbit
named
general
woundwort
.
after
they
escape
from
his
guards
they
plan
on
raiding
his
warren
and
taking
some
of
his
rabbits
that
are
not
as
loyal
.
they
succeed
by
a
small
margin
and
the
general
pursues
them
.
soon
they
find
themselves
in
a
war
each
side
fighting
for
their
lives
.
during
the
book
they
tell
each
other
side
stories
of
a
mythical
rabbit
named
el-ahrairah
yet
do
not
realize
their
adventure
is
a
legend
in
itself
.
i
think
part
of
the
reason
richard
adams
wrote
this
book
was
because
he
wanted
to
show
how
rabbits
live
and
how
their
lives
are
affected
by
humans
.
i
liked
the
originality
of
this
book
and
the
way
it
intertwines
a
view
of
the
world
through
a
rabbits
eyes
within
a
human
world
.
i
also
liked
how
the
story
tells
of
their
journey
and
when
they
finish
the
journey
half
way
through
the
book
it
continues
with
a
new
problem
.
i
did
not
like
the
way
he
used
weird
made
up
words
to
describe
human
things
because
it
made
the
story
hard
to
read
and
awkward
.
despite
this
this
book
has
earned
itself
a
five
star
rating
above
average
.
this
is
a
book
everyone
should
read
because
it
is
such
a
great
classic
and
shows
a
new
view
on
life
.
i
would
also
like
to
recommend
the
dragons
nine
sons
because
after
reading
that
i
vowed
to
recommend
it
to
everyone
i
could
.
it
is
the
best
book
i
have
ever
read
and
will
probably
never
be
beaten
.
no
one
can
go
without
reading
it
it
is
a
science
fiction
masterpiece
.

a
great
work
of
literature
i
had
to
read
watership
down
for
my
7th
grade
english
class
and
started
out
disliking
it
immensely
.
i
mean
i
do
n't
know
a
single
seventh
grader
who
would
actually
enjoy
reading
a
400
page
book
about
talking
rabbits
.
as
i
read
more
and
more
in
the
book
though
my
opinion
of
watership
down
changed
drastically
.
i
realized
that
the
themes
and
characters
in
the
book
are
powerful
and
more
than
they
appear
to
be
.
the
characters
are
vivid
and
strong
and
i
especially
liked
hazel
the
beloved
and
courageous
chief
rabbit
who
proves
his
worth
again
and
again
to
his
people
.
the
ending
in
watership
down
was
perfect
and
it
will
have
a
lasting
impression
on
me
.
my
advice
to
possible
readers
is
this
watership
down
is
a
great
book
.
yes
it
was
sometimes
slow
and
tiresome
but
it
was
also
more
than
a
book
about
talking
rabbits
.
do
n't
let
those
rabbits
stop
you
from
such
a
wonderful
story
.
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
book
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
appreciates
quality
literature
.

this

-
an

for
reading
out

to

richard
adams
is
a
genius
it
does
not
take
long
to
get
atatched
to
this
book
.
adams
brings
the
reader
on
an
adventure
starting
early
on
in
the
book
.
once
hazel
and
fiver
start
their
journey
the
book
becomes
extremely
addictive
.
i
am
a
consatnt
reader
and
this
book
is
easily
one
of
my
top
three
novels
i
have
ever
read
.
as
the
characters
were
being
introduced
i
found
a
strong
connection
to
the
lord
of
the
rings
trilogy
.
this
is
a
true
adventure
book
but
i
would
also
recommend
this
book
to
any
peron
that
loves
to
read
.

this

kept
me
reading
late
into
the
hours
of
the
night
.
this
is
an
excellent
novel
.
i
am
a
seventh
grader
so
it
may
be
surprising
that
i
enjoyed
and
even
understood
this
bookbut
i
truly
did
.
i
found
it
to
be
a
beautifully
illustrated
tale
of
adventure
courageand
teamwork
.
the
descriptions
were
vivid
and
the
characters
well
developed
.
it
may
be
difficult
to
get
into
but
if
you
stick
with
it
it
will
become
spellbinding
.
it
is
a
taut
tale
of
suspense
hot
pursuitand
derring-do
.
i
highly
encourage
reading
this
book
.

watership
down
i
am
in
sixth
grade
right
now
and
i
am
reading
this
book.i
first
got
watership
down
in
third
grade
when
i
finished
an
american
girl
450
page
book
in
a
matter
of
days
.
it
was
my
mom
's
and
she
says
this
is
her
favorite
book
.
i
did
n't
want
to
read
this
book
.
it
looked
boring
my
copy
is
from
1775
.
instead
i
read
tales
from
watership
down
and
it
did
not
all
make
sense
but
i
remember
one
part
was
about
some
one
wanting
someone
else
to
tell
them
a
story
that
did
not
usually
tell
stories
.
i
think
this
was
fiver
and
he
told
a
really
unlikely
story
and
every
step
of
the
way
bigwig
i
think
was
doubting
fiver
.
i
look
back
now
and
laugh
because
it
all
makes
sense
.
now
i
am
reading
the
actual
story
and
i
love
it
.
its
amazing
but
really
hard
to
read
.
i
am
a
really
quick
reader
i
usually
finish
books
really
quickly
.
this
book
i
have
been
reading
for
a
week
already
.
i
think
it
is
taking
me
so
long
because
it
is
really
hard
to
read
.
not
that
i
do
n't
love
it
of
course
.
this
is
one
of
the
best
books
ever
.
its
such
a
shame
that
its
not
very
popular
anymore
...
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
some
day
i
'll
have
to
read
this
for
school
.
its
just
that
kind
of
book
.
all
my
friends
at
first
glance
think
its
really
boring
.
but
then
again
that
's
just
judging
a
book
by
it
cover
.
it
is
the
kind
of
book
that
will
bore
some
people
though
.
the
begining
is
very
slow
.
not
everyone
will
like
this
book
.
i
can
see
both
points
of
views
.
most
people
i
think
will
like
it
though
.
i
love
it
.
why
not
try
it
you
'll
never
know
until
you
read
it
...
