adams
in
2005
revealed
that
``
watership
down
was
never
intended
to
be
some
sort
of

the

it
has

suggested
that

symbolism
of
several
religions
or
that
the
stories
of
el-ahrairah
were
meant
to
mimic
some
elements
of
real-world
religion
.
when
asked
in
a
2007
bbc
radio
interview
about
the
religious
symbolism
in
the
novel
adams
stated
that
the
story
was
``
nothing

that
at

adams
said
that
the
rabbits
in
watership
down
did
not
worship
however
``
they
believed
passionately
in
el-ahrairah
''
.
adams
explained
that
he
meant
the
book
to
be
``
only
a
made-up
story
...
in
no

an

any

instead
he

``

''
religious
stories
of
el-ahrairah
were
meant
more
as
legendary
tales
similar
to
a
rabbit
robin
hood
and
that
these
stories
were
interspersed
throughout
the
book
as
humorous
interjections
to
the
often
``
grim
''
tales
of
the
``
real

is
a
powerful
element

this

criticized
adams

she
observed
that
the
first

of

is
a
``
celebration
of
male
camaraderie
competence
bravery
and
loyalty
as
a
scraggly

bucks

triumphant
at

only
to
realize
that
they
have
no
females
for
mating.27
``
fully
the
last
two-thirds
of
adams
's
saga
''
lanes
argued
``
is
devoted
to
what
one
male
reviewer
has
blithely
labelled
the
rape
of
the
sabine
rabbits
a
ruthless
single-minded
and
rather
mean-spirited
search
for
females
â
not
because
watership
down

males
miss
their
companionship
or
yearn
for
love

rather
to
perpetuate
the
existing
band

``
27
for
adams

continued
the
does
are
only
``
instruments
of
reproduction
''
to
prevent
the
achievement
of
reaching
watership
down
from
``
becoming
a
hollow
victory

as
evidence

value
``
it
came
naturally

to
consider

simply
as

``
28
lanes
argued
that
this
view
of
the
female

came
from

than
his
source

ronald

's
the
private

in

text
by
contrast
the
rabbit
world
is
matriarchal
and
new
warrens
are
always

by

young

hence
lanes
concluded
adams
's
novel
is
``
marred
by
an
