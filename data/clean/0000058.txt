spoon-feeding

pseudo-intellectual
``

''
d-grade
thriller
shite
under
a
pretense
of
real
sophistication
and
getting
orally
serviced
by
the
new
york
times
for
his
effort.i
'd
heard
that
the
novel
was
meticulously
researched
and
contained
some
really
interesting
and
controversial
assessments
of
religious
zealotry
.
um
not
really
well
not
by
my
merovingian
standards
anyway
.
dlet
's
put
it
this
way
.
if
dan
brown
was
teaching
an
insurgent
christian
symbolism
in
art
and
literature
101
class
at
my
local
community
college
i
'd
definitely
have
a
different
opinion
about
him
.
but
no
.
dan
brown
is
not
a
professor
of
anything
but
pap
.
he
is
a
barely
competent
thriller
writer
who
wrote
an
awful
book
that
i
could
not
bear
to
finish
because
i
felt
my
iq
plummeting
a
little
further
with
every
``
let

guidebook
''
description
and
blowhard
authorial
essay
.
oh
do
n't
even
get
me
started
about
those
cute
soliloquies
the
main
characters
are
so
fond
of
delivering
ever
so
calmly
often
while
cops
n
'
bovvers
are
chasing
them.the
characters
are
weakly
drawn
.
the
dialogue
is
excruciating
.
the
research
is
shoddy
and
self-serving
at
best
.
the
plot
no
matter
how
open-minded
you
are
is
beyond
ludicrous
.
it
's
laughable
enough
to
be
incorporated
into
the
next
indiana
jones
movie
.
that
'd
be
sweet
dude.what
really
irks
me
are
dan
brown
's
sanctimonious
interviews
wherein
he
shows
off
all
of
his
priceless
antiques
while
expressing
his
abiding
convictions
that
the
american
public
needs
a
``
deeper
appreciation
''
of
art
and
history
and
culture
.
what
a
shallow
self-aggrandizing
hypocrite
.
i
'm
all
for
fictional
subversion
of
the
dominant
catholic
paradigm
but
only
if
the
subverter
knows
what
the
hell
they
're
talking
about
.
brown
does
n't
.
he
's
all
``
la
la
la
connect
the
dots
''
but
the
picture
he
comes
up
with
is
awkward
and
unconvincing.the
davinci
choad
is
a
dead
easy
nay
downright
lazy
read
and
yet
droves
of
people
are
patting
themselves
on
the
back
for
having
read
and
gasp
actually
understood
it
.
like
this
is
some
spectacular
achievement
why
what
because
the
slipcover
describes
it
as
``
erudite
''
are
you
fucking
kidding
medo
n't
believe
the
hype
kids
.
you
are
profoundly
more
intelligent
than
this
holiday
page-turner
gives
you
credit
for.if
you
really
honestly
just
plain
liked
the
book
that
's
cool
i
guess
.
maybe
you
also
prefer
anne
geddes
to
alfred
stieglitz
kenny
g
to
sidney
bechet
john
tesh
to
igor
stravinsky
.
your
prerogative
.
just
...
.
please
do
n't
try
to
tell
me
that
this
is
``
fascinating
''
or
``
meaningful
literature
''
.
frickin
'
read
the
club
dumas

something

then
we
'll
talk

un

un

da

una

gettiamo

riempiamo
il

mettiamo

il

for
different
thinking
.
that
is
a
good
thing
...
poorly
written
or
not.if
you
finish
the
book
you
will
notice
that
dan
brown
even
makes
it
clear
to
readers
through
his
characters
words
that
he
does
n't
want
to
destroy
christianity
because
it
has
done
so
much
good
for
so
many
people
and
if
it
works
for
them
let
's
let
them
continue
to
do
what
works
for
them
.
but
find
your
own
path
.
if
you
were
or
are
a
christian
ask
yourself
about
the
topics
in
this
book
.
they
are
so
eye
opening
.
jesus
having
a
baby
totally
possible
...
never
thought
of
it
before
.
never
thought
of
it
.
is
it
true
who
knows
.
things
like
this
are
happening
all
the
time
today
...
weapons
of
mass
destruction
in
iraq
sound
familiar
maybe
the
church
repressed
information
like
this
because
it
was
a
threat
to
the
church
.
totally
possible
.
the
catholic
church
creating
the
biblical
canon
with
a
political
agenda
to
wipe
out
paganism
actually
this
seems
to
be
a
fact
.
women
being
oppressed
due
to
the
fear
of
religous
zealot
men
in
power
losing
their
power
...
never
looked
at
it
that
way
.
but
this
seems
to
be
a
fact
too
.
is
it
helpful
in
broadening
my
perspective
of
the
fact
that
christianity
is
just
a
religion
made
by
fallible
people
.
it
sure
is
.
does
it
open
my
mind
to
other
faiths
like
paganism
judiasm
islam
bhuddism
and
want
to
take
the
truths
from
all
of
them
and
then
think
for
myself
and
figure
out
my
own
truth
.
it
sure
does
...
and
that
is
what
this
book
has
probably
done
for
many
other
people
.
why
do
you
think
dan
brown
's
book
was
on
the
bestseller
list
for
so
long
...
and
became
a
movie
...
obviously
it
was
doing
some
good
.

187the
key
to
the
davinci
code
is
that
it
's
filled
with
startling
plot
twists
and
almost
every
chapter
ends
with
a
''cliffhanger
''
so
you
have
to
keep
reading
to
see
what
will
happen
.
using
this
formula
i
wrote
the
following
blockbuster
novel
titled
the
constitution
conundrum
.
it
's
fairly
short
now
but
when
i
get
a
huge
publishing
contract
i
'll
flesh
it
out
to
100000
words
by
adding
sentences.chapter
one
handsome
yet
unmarried
historian
hugh
heckman
stood
in
the
national
archives
building
in
washington
d.c.
squinting
through
the
bulletproof
glass
at
the
u.s.
constitution
.
suddenly
he
made
an
amazing
discovery
.
''my
god
''
he
said
out
loud
.
this
is
incredible
soon
i
will
say
what
it
is
.
''chapter
two
''what
is
it
''
said
a
woman
heckman
had
never
seen
before
who
happened
to
be
standing
next
to
him
.
she
was
extremely
beautiful
but
wore
glasses
as
a
sign
of
intelligence
.
''my
name
is
desiree
legume
''
she
said.heckman
felt
he
could
trust
her
.
''look
at
this
''
he
said
pointing
to
the
constitution
.
''my
god
that
's
incredible
''
said
desiree
.
it
's
going
to
be
very
surprising
when
we
finally
reveal
what
we
're
talking
about
''
chapter
three
''yes
''
said
hugh
incredible
as
it
seems
there
are
extra
words
written
in
the
margin
of
the
u.s.
constitution
and
nobody
ever
noticed
them
until
now
they
appear
to
be
in
some
kind
of
code
.
'
''
'let
me
look
''
said
desiree
.
in
addition
to
being
gorgeous
i
am
a
trained
codebreaker
.
oh
my
god
''
''what
is
it
''
asked
hugh
in
an
excited
yet
concerned
tone
of
voice
.
''the
message
''
said
desiree
is
.
.
.
''but
just
then
the
chapter
ended.chapter
four
''it
's
a
fiendishly
clever
code
''
explained
desiree
.
'as
you
can
see
the
words
say
white
house
white

bite

'
'
''
'yes
''
said
hugh
frowning
in
bafflement
.
but
what
can
it
possibly
mean
''
''if
i
am
correct
''
said
desiree
it
is
referring
to
.
.
.
the
white
house
''
''my
god
''
said
hugh
.
that
's
where
the
president
lives
do
you
think
.
.
.
'
''
'do
i
think
what
''
said
desiree
.
''i
do
n't
know
''
said
hugh
.
but
we
're
about
to
find
out
.
''chapter
five
hugh
and
desiree
crouched
in
some
bushes
next
to
the
oval
office
.
''we
'd
better
hurry
up
and
solve
this
mystery
''
remarked
desiree
anxiously
.
''it
's
only
a
matter
of
time
before
somebody
notices
that
the
constitution
is
missing
.
''
she
had
slipped
it
into
her
purse
at
the
national
archives
while
the
guard
was
n't
looking
.
''the
answer
must
be
here
somewhere
''
said
hugh
studying
the
ancient
document
which
was
brown
from
age
and
the
fact
that
he
had
spilled
diet
peach
snapple
on
it
.
''wait
a
minute
''
he
said
.
i
've
got
it
''
''what
''
said
desiree
her
breasts
heaving
into
view
.
''the
answer
''
said
hugh
.
it
's
.
.
.but
just
then
shots
rang
out.chapter
six
''that
was
close
''
remarked
desiree
.
fortunately
those
shots
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
plot
of
this
book
.
'
''
'yes
''
said
hugh
.
anyway
as
i
was
saying
the
answer
is
to
hold
the
constitution
up
so
that
it
is
aligned
with
the
white
house
and
the
washington
monument
.
.
.
.
there
do
you
see
what
i
mean
''
''my
god
''
said
desiree
seeing
what
he
meant
.
it
's
.
.
.
'
''
'hold
it
right
there
''
said
the
president
of
the
united
states.chapter
seven
''
.
.
.
and
so
you
see
''
concluded
the
president
you
two
uncovered
a
shocking
and
fascinating
secret
that
if
it
should
ever
get
out
could
change
the
course
of
history.
''
''mr
.
president
''
said
desiree
thank
you
for
that
riveting
and
satisfying
explanation
which
will
be
fleshed
out
into
much
greater
detail
once
there
is
a
publishing
contract
.
'
''
'also
''
noted
hugh
we
may
use
some
beverage
other
than
snapple
depending
on
what
kind
of
product-placement
deals
can
be
worked
out
.
'
''
'good
''
said
the
president
.
now
can
i
have
the
constitution
back
''
they
all
enjoyed
a
hearty
laugh

something

the
da
vinci
code
makes
for
a
reasonable
airline
novel
so
much
so
that
it
is
often
a
bit
clunky
in
its
desire
to
ensure
that
no
intellectual
effort
on
the
reader
's
part
will
be
required
.
here
's
a
recurring
example
in
this
novel
a
bit
of
unfamiliar
terminology
say
``
crux
gemmata
''
jeweled
cross
will
will
be
explained
on
page
n
then
on
page
n1
a
character
will
finger
his
jeweled
cross
and
explain
``
oh
yes
--
this
is
a
crux
gemmata
.
''
i
've
read
dinner
menus
that
were
more
demanding
on
the
reader
.
my
wife
and
i
both
read
about
a
third
of
it
in
a
day
sharing
the
same
copy
and
that
's
a
full
work
day
plus
taking
care
of
kids
bedtime
etc
.
that
's
also
a
kind
of
virtue
i
guess
--
it
's
fast
and
peppy.as
far
as
history
goes
dan
brown
apparently
thinks
that
``
most
historians
''
give
credence
to
the
hoary
forgeries
and
frauds
promoted
in
sensationalist
best-sellers
like
holy
blood
holy
grail
.
this
author
gets
the
best
of
both
worlds
simultaneously
claiming
that
``
it
's
just
fiction
''
while
introducing
the
novel
with
claims
that
the
historical
record
contained
within
is
``
fact
.
''
that
claim
is
ridiculous
.
to
pluck
a
random
example
he
spends
some
time
talking
about
the
council
of
nicaea
and
incorrectly
summarizes
it
as
the
origin
of
the
doctrine
of
christ
's
divinity
by
constantine
.
he
ignores
the
arian
controversy
out
of
which
it
arose
which
is
like
trying
to
explain
the
treaty
of
versailles
without
mentioning
world
war
i
.
he
ignores
the
documented
fact
agreed
upon
even
by
the
cheerleaders
of
the
gnostics
that
he
is
sympathetic
to
that
the
earliest
gnostic
doctrines
held
that
christ
was
purely
god
and
not
really
man
--
the
very
reverse
of
the
doctrine
that
serves
as
the
linchpin
of
his
novel
's
intellectual
base
such
as
it
is
.
this
is
a
bad
novel
for
weak
or
misinformed
christians
but
anyone
familiar
with
history
should
spot
the
train
wreck
of
brown
's
ideas
a
mile
off.oh
yes
and
in
brown
's
world
opus
dei
has
shadowy
assassin
``
monks
''
in
real
life
opus
dei
is
not
a
monastic
order
--
there
are
no
opus
dei
monks
let
alone
trained
assassins
and
the
catholic
church
has
been
promulgating
known
lies
as
its
central
dogmas
promotes
violence
throughout
the
world
and
has
been
retarding
the
progress
of
science
and
knowledge
for
2
millennia
.
brown
leaves
the
reader
with
the
impression
that
this
too
is
a
matter
of
settled
historical
record
.
oh
but
then
again
it
's
just
fiction
.
except
when
it
's
not.in
general
if
you
're
looking
for
a
heady
thriller
wrapped
around
christian
arcana
i
'd
recommend
umberto
eco
's
excellent
the
name
of
the
rose
not
this
dumbed
down
by-the-numbers

i

it
accomplished
its
goal
in
decent

unremarkable
fashion
.
now
i
have
a
strict
âdonât

approach
when
it
comes
to

so
i
am
going

ignore

much
in

beyond
my
fondness
for
the
âbig

is
something
i

really

the

holdingâ
dan
does
with
his
audience
mentioned
above
.
however
there
are
also
way
too
much
time
spent
slowing
down
to
take
a
look
around
and
where
we
are
and
where
weâve
been
.
i
started
getting
the
impression
that
brown
was
trying
to
hit
a
particular
page
count
for
the
book
and
didnât
have
anything
but
filler
to
loan
the
pages
with
.
this
is
never
a
good
thing
for
this
kind
of
story
.
3
.
the
end
not
a
big
fan
of
the
final
resolution
of
the
story
and
i
found
it
very
un
climaxy
and
a
bit
of
a
let
down
.
once
we
have
the
big
reveal
very
little
new
information
ever
really
got
added
to
the
picture
and
i
felt
like
my
curiosity
should
have
been
stroked
a
few
more
times
than
it
was
in
the
home
stretch
.
this
lack
of
satisfying
climax
left
me
with
a
serious
case
of
âblue
brain.â
still
overall
this
was
a
good
serviceable
mystery-thriller
that
seems
tailor-made
for
a
warm
afternoon
on
the
sand
.
it
isnât
great
literature
or
even
good
literature
but
it
is
a
good
thriller
a
good
concept
and
for
the
most
part
fun
.
it
seems
to
accomplish
pretty
much
exactly
what
it
set
out
to
do
.

awakening
built
on

theory
.
this
book
is
many
things
and
none
of
them
good
new
or
interesting
.
however
it
is
an
excellent
litmus
test
for
idealistic
delusion.upon
the
first
reading
i
must
admit
i
found
it
a
bit
interesting
but
then
i
turned
the
final
page
and
there
was
no
bibliography
.
no
explanation
of
how
the
author
became
familiar
with
all
the
concepts
he
claimed
to
'faithfully
portray
'
.
he
wrote
this
book
and
pretended
it
was
a
history
book
and
then
refused
to
support
it
in
any
way
.
and
any
history
you
ca
n't
check
up
on
is
a
bad
one
.
he
's
no
better
than
james
frey
.
in
fact
he
may
be
worse
since
i
know
people
who
base
their
religious
beliefs
on
this
book
whereas
frey
's
only
crime
was
wishing
he
was
scarface
.
and
really
what
macho
thirtysomething
male
doesn'tbrown
had
good
reasons
for
hiding
his
sources
they
were
forged
by
con-man
pierre
plantard
and
snuck
into
the
bibliotheque
national
in
paris
back
in
the
seventies
.
and
it
's
not
like
plantard
got
away
with
it
either
--
the
whole
'priory
of
sion
'
thing
was
debunked
thirty
years
before
this
book
was
even
written.the
artistic
'iconography
'
that
figures
heavily
into
the
mystery
is
also
completely
made-up
and
was
declared
ludicrous
by
an
art
history
professor
of
my
acquaintance
.
there
are
a
lot
of
well-known
symbols
and
allusions
in
classic
art
but
none
of
them
resemble
brown
's
claims
.
the
whole
hinge
on
which
the
plot
turns
--
the
notion
that
an
inverted
triangle
is
automatically
symbolic
of
women
--
makes
about
as
much
sense
as
declaring
that
the
use
of
the
swastika
by
3rd
century
bc
buddhists
was
proof
that
they
were
fascists.the
rest
of
brown
's
book
is
filled
with
the
sort
of
cliched
religious
conspiracies
you
get
from
your
first
year
as
a
theology
student
.
not
only
that
but
these
conspiracies
were
already
explored
by
better
writers
in
'foucault
's
pendulum
'
and
the
'illuminatus
trilogy'.well
i
've
already
done
more
legitimate
historical
research
on
this
review
than
brown
did
in
his
whole
book
so
i
guess
i
'll
call
it
a
day
.

of

i
hate

books
thriller
and
just
action
novels
.
i
hate
book
would
got
that
much
of
facts
that
can
sometimes
got
the
equal
pages
of
the
novels
events
itself..i
love
fiction
i
adore
fiction
with
a
hint
of
fantasy
that
make
me
escapes
of
our
realistic
raw
ugly
most
of
times
unpleasant
world
to
another
different
one
..i
'm
a
big
fan
of
harry
potter
-although
j.k.
rowling
successfully
made
me
read
her
greedy
realistic
raw
ugly
most
of
times
unpleasant
world
on
the
casual
vacancyand
even
loving
it
-
so
what
kind
of
magic
does
dan
brown
got
to
make
me
fall
in
love
with
robert
langdon
's
adventuresis
it
his
mixing
and
blending
the
real
historical
events
with
his
non-stop
thriller
``
fiction
''
.
i
know
some
of
the
historical
events
he
mention
are
true
and
some
are
not-or
are
they
-is
it
the
characters
itself
the
mickey
mouse
watch
is
amazing
touch
-as
a
disney
's
big
fan-
is
it
the
talented
story
telling
and
the
easy
swift
from
a
pov
to
another
or
is
it
the
melting
of
the
wall
between
the
hard
and
row
real
factshistorical
events
and
symbols
meanings
and
enjoying
reading
about
it
-without
being
an
expert
or
even
interested
to
know
about
them
from
the
start-
all
of
what
i
can
say
is
that
the
search
and
hunt
of
that
kind
of
a
thriller
novela
smart
thriller
is
set
for
me
by
dan
brown
with
these
2
novels
``
angels
and

and
the

.
it
's

.
brown
seems
to
feel
that
in
order
to
impress
the
mystery
of
the
supposed
holy
grail
conspiracy
upon
his
readers
he
must
be
repetitive
and
condescending
.
it
almost
seems
that
the
whole
purpose
of
the
book
is
to
tell
the
world
how
much
brown
knows
about
obscure
art
history
and
symbology
and
that
he
is
willing
to
explain
it
to
the
teeming
masses
of
uniformed
christendom
.
his
constant
use
of
cliff-hanger
chapter
endings
almost
every
chapter
makes
the
novel
read
like
it
was
originally
intended
as
a
serial
publication
.
much
of
brown
's
story
hinges
upon
the
loss
of
the
sacred
feminine
and
yet
his
main
female
character
a
cryptologist
for
the
french
police
is
constantly
having
to
be
led
clue
by
clue
to
obvious
conclusions
by
her
quicker
more
worldly
male
counterparts.i
might
have
put
some
stock
into
brown
's
``
history
''
he
writes
with
conviction
if
not
much
style
.
i
may
even
have
looked
into
some
of
his
sources
on
my
own
.
today
though
brown
completely
lost
any
stock
i
would
have
put
into
his
actual
knowledge
.
he
referred
multiple
times
to
jesus
christ
as
the
immaculate
conception
.
as
every
half-informed
catholic
knows
mary
was
the
immaculate
conception
conceived
without
sin
jesus
was
the
miraculous
conception
conceived
by
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit.how
this
novel
came
to
be
as
popular
as
it
is
i
can
understand
.
everyone
today
is
dying
to
get
to
the
big
truth
something
which
can
never
be
done
in
religion
.
faith
is
by
definition
something
that
is
unsubstantiated
we
must
just
believe
.
what
i
ca
n't
understand
is
how
people
can
believe
this
absolute
drivel
.

my
review
not
one
word
.
i
mean
it
.
not
one
word
of
criticism
for
this
book
's
three-star
rating
.
it
is
not
literature
it
is
not
even
particularly
well-written
farb
but
it
is
undeniably
a
page-turning
rip-snorting
adventure
story
that
pokes
fun
at
christian
religion
.
therefore
it
is
a-okay
with
me.snobs
it
's
not
about
you
.
it
's
about
normal
people
getting
their
entertainment
from
a
book
for
once
instead
of
a
tv
or
a
gaming
console
.
why
are
you
bitching
who
said
you
had
to
read
itlovers
it
's
not
about
how
much
you
love
it
.
i
did
n't
love
it
.
i
read
the
whole
thing
in
a
sitting
and
i
was
n't
about
to
get
up
until
it
was
done
and
that
's
saying
a
lot
for
someone
whose
life
list
of
books
read
includes
the
snooty
people
's
snootiest
books
.
so
yeah
three-star
review
is
a
huge
vote
of
confidence
from
this
source.religious
christians
what
in
the
hell
are
you
doing
reading
my
reviews
are
you
daft
i
wo
n't

anything
nice
about

any

soon
.
pass

yes
the
entirety
of
siberia
was
deforested
to
print
the
book
in
its
zillions
.
i
feel
bad
about
that
too
.
tell
you
what
get
out
there
and
make
hemp
paper
better
for
the
environment
plus
a
smokeable
side
product
on
a

you

eye
our
political
process
has
been
poisoned
by
it
and
the
danger
of
theocracy
is
quite
real
.
furthermore
brown
's
indictment
of
the
church
for
removing
or
suppressing
feminine
divinity
figures
is
justified
and
needs
a
much
closer
look
.
women
do
not
have
enough
of
a
role
in
religion
religious
practice
heroic
myths
and
creation
myths
nor
are
they
portrayed
as
divinity
figures
enough
.
in
short
our
religious
systems
and
institutions
lack
balance
and
have
a
bias
to
suppress
issues
stories
and
roles
that
empower
women
to
live
as
equals
to
men
.
finally
brown
wrote
his
story
simplistically
in
my
view
to
spread
his
tale
to
as
broad
an
audience
as
possible
.
though
it
is
not
as
pristine
a
narrative
as
say
umberto
eco
the
message
it
conveys
is
one
that
needs
to
be
heard
.
more
obscure
books
on
the
matter
are
not
as
accessible
as
da
vinci
code
and
if
someone
were
to
write
an
accessible
book
of
genius
on
this
subject
i
would
give
himher
all
due
praise
.
in
the
meantime
dan
brown
is
telling
a
story
that
needs
to
be
told
.
it
is
one
that
has
been
kept
quiet
and
in
the
dark
for
far
too
long
.

it

your

.
that
's
one
of
the
hallmarks
of
poor
writing.even
if
i
were
not
a
practicing
pagan
i
would
find
it
stretching
credibility
that
every
single
item
the
characters
run
across
is
a
symbol
of
goddess
worship
.
five
pointed
star
goddess
worship
.
chalice
goddess
worship
.
porcelain
toilet
bowl
goddess
worship
.
pilot
ball
point
pen
goddess
worship
.
you
get
the
general
idea
.
not
only
is
every
item
part
of
the
mythology
of
the
divine
feminine
but
every
number
is
also
part
of
the
divine
feminine
.
hello
is
a
cigar
never
just
a
cigar
and
some
of
the
claims
of
symbolism
are
just
plain
wrong
as
the
editor
would
have
found
out
if
he
'd
bothered
to
do
some
fact
checking
.
remember
those
military
chevrons
that
because
of
the
way
they
were
pointed
represented
the
female
divine
and
those
poor
slobs
of
soldiers
had
been
running
around
all
these
countless
centuries
with
goddess
symbols
flaunted
on
their
uniforms
without
knowing
it
the
only
problem
with
that
premise
is
that
the
chevrons
facing
in
their
current
direction
is
relatively
recent
-
according
to
my
military
historian
husband
they
faced
the
opposite
direction
for
quite
some
time
before
being
reversed
for
what
reason
i
have
no
idea
...
unless
the
generals
all
got
together
and
decided
they
did
n't
have
quite
enough
goddess
symbols
on
their
uniforms
and
needed
it
fixed
post
haste.my
theology
professor
ended
up
traveling
around
the
country
giving
talks
about
this
book
to
thousands
of
interested
people
.
he
loves
the
book
if
only
because
he
's
now
giving
pretty
much
the
same
information
that
he
used
to
give
to
dozing
freshman
and
sophomores
to
packed
theaters
of
interested
listeners
.
he
tells
a
story
about
being
somewhere
in
southern
ohio
and
making
a
joking
remark
about
the
celice
being
something
that
all
catholics
wore
and
how
now
the
secret
was
out
and
there
was
a
lady
in
the
back
row
who
elbowed
her
husband
and
said
``
see
i
told
you
so
''
the
increased
interest
in
history
is
about
the
only
positive
thing
that
's
come
out
of
this
book
.
honestly
you
do
n't
need
to
make
anything
up
about
the
catholic
church
to
point
out
that
it
's
been
the
source
of
some
horrible
things.i
could
go
on
about
the
poor
research
and
editing
in
this
book
but
others
have
done
a
pretty
thorough
job
of
finding
the
problems
with
it.if
you
want
a
decent
page
turner
go
for
it
.
if
you
want
something
well
researched
and
accurate
give
this
one
a
big
ol
'
pass

if

take

you
probably
could

giving
this
wonderful
little
story
to
er
a
writer

i

be

read
the

in
one
afternoon
without
even
having
to
get
up
for

i
could

feel

i
was

and
that
's
a
big
part
of
a
book
's
validity-
the
whole
``
quality

thing
.
anyway
you
kind
of
got
fucked
over
with
the
whole
international
attention
thing-
now
all
the
'cool
'
people
in
the
world
will
diss
on
your
book
because
it
's
way
overblown
and
the
only
people
who
still
embrace
will
be
those
poor
little
simpletons
who
do
n't
know
the
difference
between
hip
and
square
.
looks

it
's
a
life
in
the
lower-middle
class
for
you

by
granite-jawed
harvard
professor
of
symbology
still
makes
me
laugh
every
time
i
think
about
it
robert
langdon
a
tweedy
brainiac
and
french
police
cryptologist
sophie
neveu
who
is
touted
as
brilliant
but
who
spends
most
of
the
time
playing
second
fiddle
to
langdon
's
encyclopedic
knowledge
as
they
run
around
europe
in
about
a
48-hour
time
period
i
believe
being
chased
by
the
evil
catholic
church
the
french
police
and
assorted
other
baddies
.
this
europe-wide
clue
chase
has
been
set
in
train
by
sophie
's
grandfather
who
while
being
murdered
somehow
manages
to
set
up
a
ridiculously
elaborate
trail
to
lead
our
heroes
to
the
big
secret.confused
remember
the
movie
where
tom
hanks
spends
99
of
the
time
with
a
puzzled
frown
on
his
face
and
the
dumbest
hairstyle
i
have
ever
seen
him
wearimage
errorthat
frown
is
reflected
on
my
face
as
i
try
to
figure
out
how
in
the
world
this
novel
got
to
be
so
popular
.
i
think
the
answer
lies
in
the
fact
that
if
you
just
give
up
on
any
attempt
to
analyze
what
db
is
positing
do
n't
worry
about
the
writing
and
just
go
with
the
flow
you
get
a
page-turner
that
hurtles
you
toward
the
point
where
you
are
mercifully
done
with
the
book
.
that
's
what
that
second
star
is
for
.
and
there
are
tons
of
people
who
love
all
that
esoteric-mystery
stuff
plus
the
book
came
to
the
attention
of
a
certain
type
of
christian
who
is
very
easy
to
bait
into
perceiving
any
criticism
of
any
aspect
of
christianity
as
a
huge
threat
and
the
resulting
kerfuffle
must
have
had
db
's
publicist
offering
up
heartfelt
prayers
of
thanksgiving.nope
i
'm
still
puzzled
.
on
my
second
time
around
i
really
paid
attention
to
the
writing
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
da
vinci
code
is
a
truly
execrable
piece
of
prose
that
manages
to
include
just
about
every
mistake
wannabe
novelists
are
told
to
avoid
.
i
particularly
love
the
way
you
're
in
the
middle
of
an
exciting
chase-around
and
then
the
action
suddenly
grinds
to
a
halt
while
langdon
launches
into
yet
another
of
his
explanations
.
and
the
bits
where
db
was
obviously
writing
with
a
map
of
paris
and
a
guidebook
at
his
elbow
so
that
you
get
turn-by-turn
street
nav
and
a
guided
tour
of
wherever
they
happen
to
be
down
to
the
exact
dimensions
of
the
room.and
can
you
say
plot
illogicalities
and
what
about
the
moving
body
parts
``
langdon
's
eyes
followed
her
arm
to
the
structure
ahead
''
and
db
's
cringeworthily
bad
understanding
of
british
well
everything
as
personified
in
sir
lee
tebing
't
was
an
audiobook
so
the
spelling
may
be
wrong
i
personally
like
surly
t-bing
.
the
other
characters
even
those
who
should
have
known
kept
calling
him
sir
tebing
it
should
be
sir
lee
and
even
at
one
glorious
moment
``
your
knightship
''
.
and
he
put
clotted
cream
in
his
tea
...
please
see
this
discussion
so
i
do
n't
have
to
go
over
it
again
.
last
but
definitely
not
least
there
was
supposed
to
be
some
sexual
attraction
between
langdon
and
neveu
but
any
time
db
went
there
it
was
as
awkward
as
watching
your
brother
come
on
to
your
bff
.
there
's
something
eerily
virginal
about
langdon
which
i
swear
manages
to
communicate
itself
to
hanks
.
never
have
i
seen
the
tom
look
less
attractive.this
is
definitely
not
the
best
book
to
listen
to
as
an
audiobook
unless
you
are
very
very
masochistic
.
the
narrator
has
to
do
huge
chunks
of
the
story
in
a
french
accent
and
then
there
's
lee
tebing
who
got
a
ludicrously
overblown
stage
british
heehaw
voice
in
my
version
.
then
there
was
the
pronunciation
of
louvre
as
loov
and
tuileries
as
tooleries
but
you
know
i
've
got
to
hand
it
to
this
guy
-
to
wade
through
a
reading
of
this
scab
on
the
body
literary
must
be
quite
the
endurance
test.as
a
bad
book
read
it
's
superb
.
i
had
to
stop
about
every
two
minutes
in
some
chapters
because
there
were
just
so
so
many
things
wrong
with
this
book
.
see
here
for
the
full
roundup
.
i
did
however
fall
asleep
in
a
couple
of
places
as
i
have
done
every
time
i
have
attempted
to
watch
the
movie.finding
the
hanks
images
has
been
about
the
only
thing
that
's
kept
me
going
through
this
review
.
the
success
of
this
loose
stool
of
a
novel
remains
one
of
the
great
mysteries
of
the
age
.

the

that
i
did
n't
work
for
her
much
longer
.
i
really
did
hate
this
book
.
i
hated
this
book
before
i
knew
it
was
cool
to
hate
it
.
the
writing
was
mediocre
â
that
's
not
why
i
hated
it
though
it
made
makes
me
sick
that
something
that
led
the
best-seller
list
for
approximately
a
hundred
and
sixty-three
years
was
so
bad
.
i
do
n't
generally
go
for
international
suspense
thriller
type
things
â
that
's
not
why
i
hated
it
either
.
i
was
raised
catholic
and
this
was
an
absurd
view
of
a
conspiracy-laden
church
that
was
so
dumb
as
to
be
offensive
â
but
that
â
the
vatican
's
opinion
aside
â
is
still
not
why
i
hated
it
.
the
reason
i
got
that
blue-laser-beam
duck-and-cover
light
in
my
eyes
when
i
read
this
was
that
it
completely
and
totally
screwed
with
art
history
.
i
kick
myself
once
in
a
while
that
i
deleted
the
web
page
i
put
up
at
the
time
outlining
and
illustrating
the
things
dan
brown
simply
got
wrong
about
the
paintings
and
artists
he
pretended
to
know
so
much
about
.
there
was
a
lot
of
stuff
up
there
.
i
'm
no
expert
i
went
to
art
school
though
and
the
best
teacher
i
ever
had
in
any
subject
happened
to
be
the
one
who
taught
history
of
western
art
.
it
offended
me
on
her
behalf
that
there
was
so
much
garbage
spewed
out
in
this
book
.
someone
defensively
said
to
me
once
that
at
least
it
was
bringing
attention
to
da
vinci
and
art
and
the
louvre
and
â
stuff
.
to
me
that
's
like
saying
an
a-list
celebrity
benefits
from
the
attention
of
paparazzi
.
there
's
a
strong
similarity
if
all
a
person
goes
by
is
the
sordid
and
erroneous
crap
spoon-fed
to
them
by
such
authorities
as
dan
brown
or
the
national
inquirer
enquirer
ca
n't
be
bothered
to
check
they
would
be
better
off
remaining
completely
ignorant
.
i
'm
still
cranky

item
just
now
on
google
but
it
looks
as
though
well-meaning
people
have
done
their
best
to
hide
the
evidence
.
i
'd
really
like
to
thank
them
for
that
.
anyway
if
you
search
on
my
name
and
``
da
vinci
code
''
or
``
dan
brown
''
you
'll
find
pointers
to
it
though
i
've
so
far
been
unable
to
retrieve
the
actual
text.as
far
as
i
can
recall
the
background
was
roughly
as
follows
.
a
columnist
in
the
independent
christina
patterson
had
written
an
article
in
which
she
dismissively
attacked
the
da
vinci
code
and
cited
a
recent
interview
with
the
author
.
mr
brown
had
been
asked
why
he
thought
his
book
was
a
success
and
had
said
something
about
how
he
believed
that
what
people
liked
was
books
with
``
puzzles
and
treasure
hunts
''
.
patterson
remarked
with
evident
contempt
that
there
were
no
puzzles
and
treasure
hunts
in
if
i
'm
remembering
correctly
shakespeare
dickens
or
tolstoy.well
...
i
'm
a
big
fan
of
due
process
.
i
thought
saddam
hussein
was
a
monster
who
deserved
death
fifty
times
over
but
i
opposed
the
iraq
war
on
the
grounds
that
virtually
the
only
bad
thing
he
had
n't
done
was
to
harbor
secret
weapons
of
mass
destruction
which
was
the
ostensible
reason
for
invading
his
country
.
my
feelings
about
dan
brown
were
similar
.
so
the
letter
pointed
out
that
ms.
patterson
was
just
cherry-picking
her
authors
.
as
far
as
i
was
aware
she
was
quite
correct
in
saying
that
shakespeare
dickens
and
tolstoy
did
n't
do
puzzles
and
treasure-hunts
but
if
she
'd
wanted
to
argue
the
contrary
position
she
could
just
as
easily
have
cited
lewis
carroll
james
joyce
and
vladimir
nabokov
.
the
real
problem
with
dan
brown
was
not
the
subject
matter
but
the
quality
of
the
writing.sigh
.
i
thought
i
'd
better
come
clean
.
i
'd
rather
that
you
hear
it
from
me
directly
than
you
know
just
stumble
over
it
by
accident
when
you
're
following
a
random
link
.
maybe
some
day

if

're
catholic
or
knowledgeable
at
all
about

it
does
provide
some
fodder
for
thought
in

drama

but
after
you
think
you
realize
that
none
of
this
information
true
or
not
is
really
that
shocking
and
has
little
effect
on
the
catholic
faith
.
people
would
do
well
to
learn
about
the
nature
and
history
of
their
belief
system
a
little
more
.
i
still
ca
n't
figure
out
how
this
book
has
caused
so
much
controversy
.
let
me
rephrase
that
.
i
still
ca
n't
figure
out
how
people
can
be
so
oblivious
and
closeminded
as
to
be
scandalized
by
drivelly
fiction
.
i
was
on
an
airplane
a
while
ago
and
i
sat
next
to
a
man
reading
``
cracking
the
davinci
code
''
or
one
of
those
other
pissed
off
books
that
came
out
soon
after
.
i
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
the
book
.
he
said
'oh
i
've
never
read
the
da
vinci
code
it
goes
against
the
catholic
church
why
would
i
read
such
blasphemy
i
just
want
to
be
armed
with
information
when
i
speak
to
some
simple-minded
person
who
believes
that
heretic
dan
brown
''
i
wish
i
could
make
that
kind
of
stuff
up
.
i
was
silent
smiled
and
nodded
and
quickly
opened
up
kavalier
and
clay
.
i
simply
had
no
idea
how
to
respond
to
someone
who
was
taking
notes
on
a
book
to
collect
information
on
a
novel
that
he
had
never

he
could

the

of
those

but
in
a
testament
to
the
power
of
the
feminine
wile
sv
convinced
me
to
read
it
and
so
at
the
suggestion
of
professor
mortis
borrowed
a
copy
from
my
local
library
before
setting
out
for
the
thanksgiving
holiday
thanks
to
pg
and
laurion
for
their
lending
offers
though
i
did
not
take
them
up
on
it..so
what
did
i
think
of
this
incredibly
popular
highly
controversial
work
that
sold
literally
millions
of
copies
spawned
a
movie
and
produced
comments
from
the
vatican
itself
in
a
word
itâs
bad
.
other
appropriate
single
words
might
be
awful
atrocious
terrible
or
abominable
.
other
similar
synonyms
can
be
found
here.the
da
vinci
code
is
a
combination
of
bad
writing
shoddy
history
poor
plotting
and
unconvincing
characters
that
blends
together
to
form
a
barely
readable
work
.
the
fact
that
anyone
took
this
work
seriously
in
any
capacity
is
amazing
to
me
.
the
characters
are
flat
boring
and
none
of
them
exceed
two
dimensions
at
best
.
the
âhistoryâ
is
so
riddled
with
holes
as
to
be
completely
unbelievable
to
the
semi-alert
observer
my
favorite
part
is
the
explanation
of
how
the
churchâs
desire
to
destroy
the
âsacred
feminineâ
is
responsible
for
orthodox
jews
and
devout
muslims
barring
women
from
certain
rites..
and
finally
the
plot
just
makes
no
damn
sense
.
even
the
much
vaunted
puzzles
are
fairly
trite
and
usually
explained
so
quickly
that
itâs
barely
worth
thinking
about
.
the
final
puzzle
that
the
main
character
is
faced
with
is
so
mind-bogglingly
obvious
that
anyone
who
knows
how
to
draw
a
mogen
david
star
of
david
can
figure
it
out
instantly.so
the
question
for
me
became
this
given
how
awful
this
book
is
why
the
hell
is
it
so
popular
i
can
offer
the
following
explanationsobservations.first
off
brown
employs
a
clever
and
i
use
the
term
loosely
narrative
structure
in
which
he
ends
every
single
chapter
on
a
cliffhanger
.
this
forces
the
reader
to
continue
reading
hoping
to
reach
a
payoff
or
stopping
point
that
is
never
quite
realized
.
thus
the
reader
keeps
going
to
the
next
chapter
hoping
to
finally
hit
a
point
where
the
story
will
relax
only
to
discover
that
the
story
never
really
relaxes
.
it
just
plods
relentlessly
forward
like
the
terminator
chasing
sarah
connor
with
a
sudoku
puzzle.in
a
similar
vein
brown
keeps
his
chapters
short
.
in
fact
iâve
read
verse
poetry
that
was
longer
than
some
of
the
chapters
in
this
book
and
considerably
better
written
.
this
helps
the
reader
feel
as
though
they
are
making
progress
because
theyâre
suddenly
on
chapter
44
and
can
reach
chapter
50
with
only
a
few
extra
minutes
of
reading
.
hooray
for
the
short
attention
span.likewise
brown
taps
into
some
popular
political
and
historical
fallacies
that
are
guaranteed
to
make
him
well-liked
.
namely
that
the
catholic
church
is
an
evil
conspiracy
christianity
is
one
of
the
few
religions
itâs
still
ok
to
hate
in
this
day
and
age
after
all
and
the
notion
that
ancient
europeans
were
all
ecologically
conscious
goddess-worshipping
pacifists
until
the
evil
patriarchy
destroyed
their
edenic
culture
.
and
hey
both
of
those
are
popular
if
totally
un-nuanced
and
historically
questionable
viewpoints
but
shoddy
history
is
always
popular
with
the
masses
.
the
popularity
of
this
book
is
proof
enough.knowing
that
iâm
one
of
the
last
people
in
the
united
states
to
have
read
this
book
i
can
hardly
imagine
my
recommendation
can
save
anyone
at
this
point
but
on
the
off
hand
chance
it
canâdonât
read
this
book
.
itâs
a
waste
of
time
.
at
the
very
least
take
it
out
of
the
library
so
you
donât
put
more
money
into
the
pocket
of
an
author
of
questionable
talent
.
thereâs
much
better
writers
in
this
world

i

she
explained
to
my
relief
that
she
did
n't
think
the

was
well
written
you
know
good
she
just
thought
it
was

appreciated
the

i

despite
facing
that
charge
from
many
experienced
readers
.
he
has
a
likable
style
and
he
drives
the
pace
of
the
book
relentlessly
which
is
exactly
what
one
would
want
from
a
pulpy
adventure
that
one
can
take
to
the
beach
.
likewise
the
charge
that
the
da
vinci
code
is
somehow
a
failure
because
it
is
in
any
way
inaccurate
or
unbelievable
is
unfair
.
the
story
is
fiction
after
all
and
one
should
expect
to
have
hisher
credulity
stretched
especially
when
reading
pulp
that
is
written
with
the
screen
in
mind
as
the
da
vinci
code
surely
was.i
even
enjoyed
the
sunday
afternoon
it
took
me
to
read
the
da
vinci
code
.
it
was
an
absolute
waste
of
time
and
exactly
what
i
wanted
to
be
doing
sitting
on
a
comfy
sofa
drinking
tea
and
reading
about
self-flagellating
albino
monks
and
other
fun
things.i
've
given
many
books
that
are
just
as
good
as
the
da
vinci
code
and
even
some
that
are
worse
three
stars
and
i
meant
every
star
.
the
truth
is
that
on
its
own
merits
i
'd
have
given
the
da
vinci
code
a
similar
rating
if
not
for
a
repeated
experience
that
led
to
my
backlash.at
the
beginning
of
every
semester
in
a
bid
to
get
to
know
my
students
better
i
play
a
memory
game
wherein
the
students
provide
me
with
their
favourite
things
books
food
music
and
some
personal
details
people
they
hate
people
they
love
things
they
are
proud
of
then
i
connect
something
about
them
something
that
stands
out
for
me
with
their
name
.
it
is
a
good
start
in
getting
to
know
the
students
but
it
has
also
led
to
my
hatred
for
dan
brown
's
the
da
vinci
code.a
good
half
of
the
students
that
enter
my
courses
declare
that
they
do
n't
have
favourite
books
andor
they
've
only
ever
read
three
books
in
their
lives
--
two
involuntary
both
assigned
by
an
english
teacher
and
always
seeming
to
include
to
kill
a
mockingbird
and
one
voluntary
the
da
vinci
code
.
what
pisses
me
off
most
is
that
even
if
these
people
liked
the
da
vinci
code
brown
's
novel
did
n't
spur
them
on
to
read
more
.
they
read
the
the
da
vinci
code
enjoyed
it
or
did
n't
then
went
back
to
their
reading
apathy
.
moreover
if
i
could
convince
people
to
read
one
book
voluntarily
one
book
for
their
pleasure
it
would
not
be
any
cheesy
pulpy
low
grade
adventure
story
.
it
's
like
pouring
a
glass
of
9
dollar
wine
for
a
person
who
is
trying
wine
for
the
first
time
.
they
may
enjoy
the
glass
but
they
're
not
going
to
choose
wine
as
their
alcohol
of
choice
based
on
fortant
de
france
.
and
for
that
reason
i
hate
the
da
vinci
code
.
it
is
the
cheap
wine
that
keeps
people
away
from
the
joy
of
good
wine
and
while
i
admit
that
it
is
the
fault
of
popular
culture
rather
than
dan
brown
each
reader
i
find
who
stops
at
the
da
vinci
code
makes
me
hate
the
book
a
little
bit
more
.

no
one
must
read
but
it
works
for
those
of
us
that
choose
to
read.every
hour
i
spend
reading
fluff
is
an
hour
not
spent
reading
something
i
am
somewhat
sure
is
``
better
for
me
''
in
some
way
.
but
what
i
think
is
better
for
me
has
no
certain
relationship
to
anyone
else
's
self-improvement
.
that
said
it
does
grate
when
someone
does
a
mediocre
job
and
is
lauded
with
wealth
and
popular
acclaim
.
dan
brown
is
n't
bad
but
there
are
plenty
of
authors
i
'd
rather
see
receiving
bucketfuls
of
money
.
i
'm
much
happier
with
the
success
of
j.k.
rowling

trevorâ
please
do
read
both
the
name
of
the
rose
and
the
da
vinci
code
.
the
former
for
yourself
it
is
a
splendid
novel
and
the
latter
so
we
can
all
greedily
consume
your
review.hmmm
perhaps
we
should
start
a
series
of
polls
wherein
we
can
vote
on
what
trevor
should
read
and
review
next
