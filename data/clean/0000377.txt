good
album
.
wonderful
lead
single
.
it
would
have
been
so
much
better
if
there
were
more
of
her
hits
and
less
new
recordings
.
the
new
songs
are
nice
but
she
should
have
brought
back
hits
like
``
where
does
my
heart
beat
now
''
her
1st
top
ten
.
i
did
n't
like
the
different
editions
of
this
album
...
i
think
sony
should
have
released
just
one
edition
worldwide
so
that
songs
like
immortality
all
by
myself
think
twice
and
misled
would
also
be
included
in

it
is
so
moving
and

it
took
me
to
a
time
and
place
where
i
was
in
love
and
it
moved
me
to
remember
all
the
good
of
the
relationship
and
not
the
bad
and
made
me
remember
that
love
is
good
no

where
it
comes
from
.
love
this

i
would
definitely
give
it
a

album

without
doubt
my
favourite
album
out
of
them
all
my
earliest
memories
of
celine
are
listeninig
to
the
power
of
love
and
think
twice
.
i
was
very
young
when
that
album
came
out
but
i
still
have
the
original
one
that
was
bought
for
me
and
not
a
scratch
on
it

this
album
is
a
temporary
goodbye
from
celine
.
i
really
remember
when
this
cd
is
put
on
the
store
.
the
cd
cover
is
directly
recognizable
from
afar
.
about
the
songs
the
new
songs
is
really2x
good
.
some
say
that
new
songs
can
not
beat
the
9
hits
from
power
of
love
until
i
'm
your
angel
on
this
album
and
a
downhill
starting
from
i
'm
your
angel
.
i
'll
say
different
.
from
that
's
the
way
it
is
until
live
for
the
one
you
love
has
its
character
.
that
's
the
way
it
is
then
you
look
at
me
i
want
you
to
need
me
is
really2
powerful
.
if
walls
could
talk
live
for
the
one
you
love
the
first
time
ever
i
saw
your
face
and
all
the
way
is
really2x
haunting
.
the
videos
of
the
new
songs
is
also
great
to
see
.
i
really2x
like
that
's
the
way
it
is
video
.
and
also
if
you
can
find
the
remix
from
that
's
the
way
it
is
metro
club
mix
and
also
i
want
you
to
need
me
thunderpuss
remix
they
both
are
also
good
remixes
.
but
i
never
see
celine
perform
most
of
this
new
songs
live
.
i
already
saw
that
's
the
way
it
is-live
version
from
david
foster
world
's
children
day
concert
and
also
celine
millenium
concert
the
first
time
ever
i
saw
your
face
and
all
the
way
can
be
seen
from
a
new
day
...
dvd
but
the
others
i
think
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
for
example
if
walls
could
talk
or
live
for
the
one
i
love
-
live..
for
the
very
first
time
...
what
do
you
think
re
all
the
way
