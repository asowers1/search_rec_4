so
i
recently
watched
the
lion
king
in
the
theatres
and
it
was
still
as
magical
as
i
remember
it
was
growing
up
.
after
reading
some
of
the
reviews
on
here
there
seems
to
be
a
little
mix-up
as
to
what
you
get
so
i
would
just
like
to
clarify
in
case
someone
is
interested
in
this
amazing
trilogy
which
by
the
way
has
a
beautiful
outer
wood
box.the
lion
king
comes
with
the
3d
blu-ray
the
standard

the
standard
dvd
and
digital
copy.the
lion
king
1.5
comes

the
standard
blu-ray
and
the
standard
dvd.the
lion
king
2
comes
with
the
standard
blu-ray
and
the
standard
dvd.as
you
can
tell
only
the
original
lion
king
comes
with
3d
and
digital
copy
so
it
is
basically
the
same
thing
as
the
regular
4
disc
3d
pack
you
can
get
.
the
other
2
movies
only
have
the
standards
of
each
format
so
you
can
treat
them
as
basic
combo
packs
.
i
hope
this
helps
clarify
a
few
matters
and
whatever
you
do
definately
pick
this
movie
up
.

this
review
is
for
the
films
only.yes
i
said
trilogy
.
this
set
includes
the
disney
classic
the
lion
king
and
its
two
sequelsthe
lion
king
ii
simba
's
pride
and
the

king
1

.
all
three
are
great
films
which
is
surprising
due
to
disney
's
history
with
doing
sequels.the
lion
king
is
the
classic
story
of
a
young
lion
club
named
simba
who
is
next
in
line
to
become
king
of
the
pride
lands
.
as
he
gets
older
his
uncle
scar
begins
to
despise
him
and
mufasa
simba
's
father
and
scar
's
older
brother
.
mufasa
is
king
which
makes
scar
furious
and
he
makes
a
plot
to
kill
them
both
.
the
plot
is
proven
to
be
a
success
.
mufasa
is
killed
and
simba
believing
it
to
be
his
fault
runs
off
.
he
leaves
the
pridelands
and
meets
timon
and
pumbaa
a
meekat
and
warthog
who
eats
bugs
.
simba
soon
joins
the
two
and
adopts
their
``
hakuna
matata
''
it
means
no
worrieslifestyle
.
soon
simba
grows
up
and
one
day
comes
across
his
old
friend
nala
who
tells
him
that
scar
is
destroying
their
home
.
simba
at
first
disagrees
about
doing
something
about
it
but
after
meeting
with
a
old
friend
of

blu-ray
the
lion
king
is
one
of
disney
's
animated
``
golden
age
''
films
along
with
little
mermaid
alladin
etc
.
and
it
really
is
a
timeless
classic.for
the
pre-order
price
of
about
75
it
's
a
great
value
considering
the
4
disc
blue-ray
set
alone
is
going
to
run
you
at
least
30
lion
king
2
around
20
and
2
12
maybe
15
.
shell
out
a
few
more
bucks
and
you
get
a
nifty
box
to
keep
everything
in
and
you
know
that
you
have
the
complete
collection
special
features
and
all.the
great
thing
about
the
4
disc
blu
ray
combo
pack
for
the
original
lion
king
is
that
it
includes
the
regular
2d
movie
dvd
blu-ray
disc
a
3d
blu-ray
disc
this
ensures
that
whatever
technology
you
are
currently
using
you
will
be
able
to
watch
the
movie
regardless
.
and
if
you
are
using
dvd
now
you
will
have
blu-ray
for
later
when
you
upgrade
.
or
you
can
always
give
away
whichever
one
you
do
n't
wantneed
.
and
the
digital
copy
which
i
always
love
as
an
option
.
digital
copies
allow
you
to
upload
to
mobile
devices
especially
easy
for
itune
users
although
it
might
restrict
usage
to
apple
devices
such
as
your
phone
tables
great
for
keeping
you
or
maybe
your
kids
entertained
on
trips
or
when
waiting
for
stuff
and
of
course
your
laptops
and
computers.for
the
other
2
movies
lion
king
2
and
lion
king
1
12
there
is
a
dvd
blu-ray
copy
for
each.the
set
also
includes
all
the
bonus
discs
for
all
three
movies
which
of
course
has
all
the
bonus
features
deleted
scenes
commentary
shorts
new
songs
etc
etc.it
's
a
great
value
and
would
make
a
great
gift
for
anyone
who
enjoys
disney
animated
movies.if
you
dont
needwant
all
the
bells
and
whistles
or
the
other
movies
then
another
version
might
be
better
for
you
.
the
2disc
dvdblu-ray
also
has
the
special
features
just
not
the
3d
or
the
digital

i
love

lion

complaints

the
movies

this

reviewing
the
box
set
it
comes
in.the
outside
of
the
box
is
very
lovely
with
wood-like
carving

on
the
outside
.
but
once
you
open

are
in

disappointment

the
discs
are
in
thin

are
no
cases
to

the

you
just
slide
them
out

their

cardbard
.
i
can
see
this
set
getting
very
scratched
in
the
near
future
if
you
watch
these
a
lot

i
only
bought
this
set
because
i
wanted
all
3
movies

i
suggest
everyone
wait
and
buy
each
separately
in
a
appropriate
blu
ray
case
release
.
i
would
have
rather
had
all
three
movies
in
actual
blu

cases
inside
this
nice
box
than
this
cheap
crappy
drum

i
expected
