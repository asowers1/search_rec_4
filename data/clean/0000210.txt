dvd
disney
's
the
lion
king
is
finally
available
on
dvd
.
considered
the
cream
of
the
crop
of
all
the
disney
animated
features
by
many
it
is
definitely
worth
owning
.
i
do
n't
think
i
'll
go
into
the
story
which
i
'm
sure
most
of
you
know
.
chances
are
you
've
already
seen
the
movie
and
are
just
waiting
to
own
it
on
a
piece
of
media
that
wo
n't
rot
like
your
vhs
tape
that
probably
fell
apart
by
now
.
even
if
disney
released
a
sub
par
release
of
this
movie
you
'd
buy
it.luckily
this
is
one
of
the
best
releases
ever.video
and
audio
is
supreme
in
this
release
.
especially
vibrant
is
the
5.1
sound
.
of
all
the
older
disney
releases
this
one
benefits
the
most
i
think
with
the
powerful
music
and
sound
effects
present
in
this
release
.
hearing
james
earl
jones
as
mufasa
blaring
in
thunderous
5.1
sound
is
quite
amazing
.
likewise
the
excellent
music
such
as
the
opening
circle
of
life
.
present
in
this
release
is
the
original
theatrical
version
as
well
as
a
version
with
new
musicsong
.
i
actually
did
n't
care
for
the
new
song
but
some
may
.
the
extras
are
quite
numerous
contained
on
a
second
dvd
and
are
mentioned
in
amazon
's
product
details
...
i
have
n't
had
the
time
to
go
through
them
yet
so
i
can
not
comment
on
the
extras
.
i
just
watched
the
movie
again
.
to
be
honest
the
movie
would
be
worth
it
as
a
single
disc
release
so
i
'm
happy
as
it
is.some
interesting
trivia
for
some
of
the
people
who
are
not
aware
of
it
is
that
the
lion
king
seemed
to
be
heavily
``
influenced
''
by
an
old
japanese
anime
kimba
the
white
lion
.
those
wishing
to
see
the
``
similarities
''
would
do
well
to
check
out
that
series
as
it
has
also
been
released
on
dvd
.
carbon
copying
aside
i
do
love
the
lion
king
.
it
still
manages
to
grab
you
whether
you
are
4
years
old
or
40
.

--
only
about
a
2.5
by
prussianette
on
october

2011format
blu-ray
verified
purchase
i
own
a
quite
a
few
3d
movies
so
perhaps
my
expectations
were
too
high
but
despite
some
stellar
reviews
on
the
3d
on
this
product
by
some
other
reviewers
i
have
to
tell
you
the
quality
is
far
less
than
made-for-3d
movies
such
as
despicable
me.do
you
remember
those
``
3d
''
gamescartoons
where
the
``
3d
''
effect
as
you
were
supposedly
either
walking
or
in
a
car
going
along
the
road
was
the
part
closest
to
you
moved
slow
then
there
was
a
part
in
the
middle
that
moved
a
bit
faster
and
then
the
part
near
the
top
of
the
screen
moved
the
fastest
this
is
only
a
step
above
that
.
it
is
more
like
layered
2d
images
than
true
3d
.
yes
there
are
a
few
parts
where
true
3d
is
apparent
but
those
are
few
and
far
between.sorry
i
ca
n't
help
but
think
that
some
of
the
people
have
either
let
their
love
of
the
movie
color
their
perception
of
what
good
3d
looks
like
or
they
simply
do
not
have
many
3d
movies
to
compare
to.i
actually
found
the
2d
blu-ray
disc
or
even
the
regular
dvd
more
appealing
or
at
least
less
distracting
.
one
thing
i
noticed
in
all
three
versions
that
i
did
n't
notice
before
was
that
the
grass
in
the
movie
does
n't
move
when
the
animals
walk
through
it
.
although
i
did
n't
pick
up
on
this
when
i
saw
the
movie
when
it
first
came
out
it
was
one
of
the
things
that
was
painfully
apparent
in
the
3d
and
far
less
apparent
in
the
2d
versions.and
yes
i
know
there
are
people
that
will
disagree
with
me
and
mark
my
review
as
``
not
helpful
''
but
i
have
to
call
it
as
i
see
it
.

vhs
tape
after
the
movie
little
mermaid
came
out
disney
would
make
3
other
animated
masterpieces
beauty
the
beast
aladdin
and
the
lion
king
that
would
change
the
way
we
looked
at
animated
films
somthing
new
something
wonderful.but
of
all
these
4
great
animated
films
in
my
opinion
the
lion
king
was
the
greatest
.
the
music
was
just
beautiful
and
scar
was
probably
the
most
evil
disney
villain
the
was
ever
drawn
on
a
piece
of
paper.you
hated
him
but
you
almost
liked
him
because
he
was
so
great
.
but
probably
the
best
part
of
the
movie
was
simba
's
pal
's
pumbaa
and
timon
the
best
disney
characters
ever
the
scene
where
timon
was
doing
the
hula
i
thought
i
was
going
to
die
from
laughing
.
anybody
from
toddler
to
10
year
old
to
60
year
from
boy
to
old
woman
to
teenager
and
so
forth
will
without
a
doubt
love
this
movie

i
never
thought
that
a
simple
disney
movie
could
make
me
cry
but
actually
this
one
did
.
do
n't
ask
me
how
but
it
really
happened
and
the
worst
part
is
it
happened
again
and
again
and
again.this
movie
is
probably
better
than
all
the
other
disney
movies
.
it
is
wonderfully
drawn
better
then
any
disney
animation
.
i
never
liked
the
fairy-tale
disneys
but
this
one
...
there
are
no
words
for
its
absolute
great
class
...

wow
.
i
'm
still
getting
over
this
wonderful
and
breathtaking
journey
that
is
the
lion
king
.
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
movie
's
music
story
and
spiffy
characters
.
i
recommened
it
to
anyone
who
likes
movies
period
.
charcaters
such
as
timon
pumba
bring
in
comedic
relief
while
more
serious
and
awesome
characters
such
as
mufasa
help
bring
depth
and
feel
to
the
story
.
i
dont
care
if
your
2
16
28
50
or
even
90
years
of
age
you
'll
simply
fall
in
love
with
this
movie
.
if
you
ask
me
what
the
best
part
of
the
entire
movie
was
i
would
have
to
say
the
blending
of
the
music
and
picture
that
is
presented
in
such
a
way
that
is
captavating
and
breathtaking
.
buy
the
soundtrack
now
...
.also
try
the
broadway
soundtrack
.
this
is
disney
at
it
's
finest
.
this
is
one
of
the
greatest
animated
pictures
of
all
time
if
not
one
of
the
greatest
movies
ever
.
