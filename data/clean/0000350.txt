you
can
break
down
theâ
14
albums
thatâ
pink
floydâ
made
over
three
decades
into
several
distinct
eras
.
theres
the
syd
barrett
one
where
they
were
a
mind-tripping
psychedelic
band
theres
the
post-barrett
era
where
they
became
heady
prog-rockers
which
gave
way
to
their
reign
as
one
of
the
70s
biggest
groups
and
finally
theres
the
period
after
main
songwriterâ
roger
watersâ
left
a
mostly
indistinguishable
decade
of
by-the-numbers
pointlessness
.
the
majority
of
tracks
on
our
list
of
the
top
10
pink
floyd
songs
come
from
that
stretch
in
the
70s
when
they
were
one
of
the
hugest
bands
on
the
planet
.
but
we
left
room
for
some
of
the
trippy
stuff
too
.
10
'astronomy
domine'
from
'the
piper
at
the
gates
of
dawn
'
1967
syd
barrett
lasted
for
only
a
handful
of
singles
and
one
album
well
he
has
one
song
on
floyd
's
second
lp
before
his
drug-accelerating
mental
problems
pushed
him
out
of
the
band
.
the
opening
cut
on
their
debut
album
is
an
outer-space
freak-out
that
bridges
pink
floyd
's
psychedelic
and
prog
eras
with
warped
brilliance
.

'have
a
cigar'
from
'wish
you
were
here
'
1975
everyone
wanted
a
piece
of
pink
floyd
after
'the
dark
side
of
the
moon
'
sold
a
gazillion
copies
see

.

on

10
pink

songs
especially
the
shady
music-industry
types
waters
never
trusted
.
'have
a
cigar
'
is
all
about
those
clueless
suits
.

'brain
damage'
from
'the
dark
side
of
the
moon
'
1973
'the
dark
side
of
the
moon
''
s
penultimate
track
is
more
or
less
the
theme
song
of
pink
floyd
's
most
popular
album
.
more
than
any
other
cut
on
the
record
'brain
damage
'
surveys
the
mental
scars
left
on
both
the
band
and
syd
barrett
after
their
former
bandmate
's
mental
illness
forced
his
departure
first
from
the
group
and
eventually
from
reality
.
this
centerpiece
segues
into
the
closing
'eclipse
'
so
feel
free
to
tag
it
on
.
7
'echoes'
from
'meddle
'
1971
pink
floyd
's
sixth
album
was
a
turning
point
of
sorts
as
the
band
inched
closer
to
more
structured
songs
as
opposed
to
the
atmospheric
set
pieces
that
dominated
their
previous
records
.
'echoes
'
'meddle
''
s
highlight
still
runs
more
than
23
minutes
but
its
mix
of
long
instrumental
passages
and
vocal
patches
is
a
precursor
to
the
career-changing
'the
dark
side
of
the
moon
.
'
6
'money'
from
'the
dark
side
of
the
moon
'
1973
once
the
band
started
to
receive
some
attention
the
concept
of
fame
and
its
trappings
became
an
obsession
for
waters
see
no
.
9
on
our
list
of
the
top
10
pink
floyd
songs
.
ironically
'money
'
--
an
anti-greed
rant
--
became
the
group
's
first
hit
single
and
set
'the
dark
side
of
the
moon
'
on
its
path
to
one
of
the
bestselling
albums
ever
made
.
its
massive
popularity
only
added

'another
brick
in
the
wall
part
ii'
from
'the
wall
'
1979
pink
floyd
's
only
no
.
1
single
does
n't
make
a
whole
lotta
sense
outside
of
the
hit
album
's
concept
but
it
's
an
important
song
in
the
band
's
career
and
another
of
songwriter
waters
'
long
list
of
gripes
against
society
in
general
.
the
fact
thatâ
'another
brick
in
the
wall
part
ii
'
managed
to
top
the
pop-music
chart
says
much
about
the
band
's
popularity
in
the
late
'70s
and
early
'80s
.

'shine
on
you
crazy
diamond'
from
'wish
you
were
here
'
1975
'shine
on
you
crazy
diamond
'
was
originally
released
as
a
two-song
eight-part
26-minute
suite
on
the
band
's
follow-up
to
the
mega-popular
'the
dark
side
of
the
moon
.
'
and
like
several
floyd
projects
from
the
period
the
song
references
former
bandmate
syd
barrett
's
descent
into
mental
illness
.
it
's
an
epic
piece
the
bookends
to
one
of
the
group
's
most
durable
lps
.

'time'
from
'the
dark
side
of
the
moon
'
1973
like
many
tracks
onâ
our
list
of
the
top
10
pink
floyd
songs
'time
'
works
better
as
part
of
a
bigger
album
concept
than
as
a
standalone
cut
.
but
it
's
'the
dark
side
of
the
moon
''
s
linchpin
and
features
the
album
's
best
performances
especially
nick
mason
's
drum
solo
near
the
beginning
of
the
song
and
david
gilmour
's
ripping
guitar
solo
in
the
middle
.

'wish
you
were
here'
from
'wish
you
were
here
'
1975
the
members
of
pink
floyd
were
still
friendly
with
syd
barrett
after
he
left
the
group
in
1968
.
he
even
showed
up
in
the
studio
somewhat
unrecognizable
while
they
were
recording
of
their
ninth
album
.
'the
dark
side
of
the
moon
'
touched
on
the
mental
illness
that
crippled
barrett
but
'wish
you
were
here
'
was
an
album-length
tribute
to
both
his
genius
and
madness
.
the
title
track
ties
barrett
's
plight
to
waters
'
own
distancing
from
society
.
1
'comfortably
numb'
from
'the
wall
'
1979
waters
penned
most
of
'the
wall
'
by
himself
tracing
childhood
issues
to
floyd-era
conflicts
.
'comfortably
numb
'
is
one
of
the
few
songs
written
with
gilmour
who
supplies
the
music
and
terrific
guitar
solo
one
of
the
most
celebrated
in
rock
history
.
the
song
shows
up
in
the
middle
of
'the
wall
'
as
the
main
character
struggles
to
get
through
another
day
and
another
show
.
then
the
guitar
breaks
through
the
fog
providing
a
brief
glimpse
of
cathartic
clarity
.
