unlike
the
predecessors
spider-man
3
received
mixed
reviews
from
critics
who
felt
it
lacked

substantial

it
stands
as
the
most
financially
successful

successful
film
after

avengers
and
iron

highest-grossing
film
behind
skyfall
despite
being
the
most
expensive
film
of
all
time
at
release
the
record
was
surpassed
just
three
weeks
later
by
pirates
of

caribbean
at
world
's
end
.
after
the
commercial
success
of
spider-man
3
raimi
was
scheduled
to
direct
a
fourth
film
.
however
disagreements
between
sony
and
raimi
forced
the
director
to
leave
the
project
and
sony
canceled
the
film
as
a
result
.
a
reboot
of
the
trilogy
was
released
five
years

in

completed
a
seven-figure
deal
with
screenwriter
alvin
sargent
who
had
penned
spider-man
2
to
work
on
spider-man
3
with
an
option
to
write
a
fourth
film.8
immediately
after
spider-man
2
's
release
ivan
raimi
wrote
a
treatment
over
two
months9
with
sam
raimi
deciding
to
use
the
film
to
explore
peter
learning
that
he
is
not
a
sinless
vigilante
and
that
there
also
can
be
humanity
in
those
he
considers
criminals.5
harry
osborn
was
brought
back
as
raimi
wanted
to
conclude
his
storyline.5
raimi
felt
that
harry
would
not
follow
his
father
's
legacy
but
be
instead
``
somewhere
between
.
``

sandman
was
introduced
as
an
antagonist
as
raimi
found
him
a
visually
fascinating
character.5
while
sandman
is
a
petty
criminal
in
the
comics
the
screenwriters
created
a
background
of
the
character
being
uncle
ben
's
killer
to
increase
peter
's
guilt
over
his
death11
and
challenge
his
simplistic
perception
of
the
event.5
overall
raimi
described
the
film
as
being
about
peter
mary
jane
harry
and
the
sandman12
with
peter
's
journey
being
one
of
forgiveness.13
raimi
wanted
another
villain
and
ben
kingsley
was
involved
in
negotiations
to
play
the
vulture
before
the
character
was
cut.9
producer
avi
arad
convinced
raimi
to
include
venom
a
character
whose
perceived
``
lack
of
humanity
''
had
initially
been
criticized
by
sam
raimi.14
venom
's
alter-ego
eddie
brock
already
had
a
minor
role
in
the
script.15
arad
told
the
director
that
venom
had
a
strong
fan
base
so
raimi
included
the
character
to
please
them12
and
even
began
to
appreciate
the
character
himself.14
the
film
's
version
of
the
character
is
an
amalgamation
of
venom
stories
.
eddie
brock
jr.
the
human
part
of
venom
serves
as
a
mirror
to
peter
parker
with
both
characters
having
similar
jobs
and
romantic
interests.14
brock
's
actions
as
a
journalist
in
spider-man
3
also
represent
contemporary
themes
of
paparazzi
and
tabloid
journalism.16
the
producers
also
suggested
adding
rival
love
interest
gwen
stacy
filling
in
an
``
other
girl
''
type
that
raimi
already

stokdyk
chose
to
design
the

instead
of
using

imagery
so

done
to

could
be

to

were
done
with
twelve
types

as

launching
it
at

and
pouring
it
over

.
the
results
were

humby
whose
right
hand
was
amputated
at
birth
helped
deliver
the
intended
effect
of
punching
through
sandman
's
chest.30
whereas
the
symbiote
suit
worn
in
the
comics
by
spider-man
was
a
plain
black
affair
with
a
large
white
spider
on
the
front
and
back
the
design
was
changed
for
the
film
to
become
a
black
version
of
spider-man
's
traditional
costume
complete
with
webbing
motif
.
as
a
consequence
of
this
the
suit
topher
grace
wore
as
venom
also
bore
the
webbing
motif
as
producer
grant
curtis
noted
``
itâs
the
spider-man
suit
but
twisted
and
mangled
in
its
own
right
.
``
31
additionally
the
motif
gave
a
sense
of
life
to
the
symbiote
giving
it
the
appearance
of
gripping
onto
the
character
's
body.32
when
animating
the
symbiote
raimi
did
not
want
it
to
resemble
a
spider
or
an
octopus
and
to
give
it
a
sense
of
character
.
the
cg
model
is
made
of
many
separate
strands.33
when
animating
venom
himself
animators
observed
footage
of
big
cats
such
as
lions
and
cheetahs
for
the
character
's
agile
movements.34

danny
elfman
the
composer
for

did
not
plan
to
return
for
the
third
installment
of

because
of
difficulties
with

elfman
said
that
he
had
a
``

''
working
with
raimi
on
spider-man

and
could
not
comfortably
adapt

christopher

``

venom
's
theme

raimi
approved
the
new

during
their
first
performance
but
rejected
the
initial
music
to
the
birth
of
sandman
finding
it
too
monstrous
and
not
tragic
enough
.
young
had
to
recompose

of

members
set
to
reprise
their

.
both
a
fourth

a
fifth

were
planned
and
at
one
time
the
idea
of
shooting
the
two
sequels
concurrently
was
under
consideration
.
however
raimi
stated
in
march
2009
that
only
the
fourth
film
was
in
development
at
that
time
and
that
if
there
were

james
vanderbilt
was
hired
in

2007
to
pen
the
screenplay
after
initial
reports
in
early
2007
that
sony
pictures
was
in
contact
with
david
koepp
who
wrote
the
first
spider-man

by
pulitzer-winning
playwright
david
lindsay-abaire
and
rewritten
again
by
gary
ross
in
october
2009.126
sony
also
engaged
vanderbilt
to
write
scripts
for
spider-man

and
spider-man

in

raimi
expressed
interest
in
portraying
the
transformation
of
dr.
curt
connors
into
his
villainous
alter-ego
the
lizard
the
character
's
actor
dylan
baker
and
producer
grant
curtis
were
also
enthusiastic
about
the
idea.127128129
it
was
reported
in
december
2009
that
john
malkovich
was
in
negotiations
to
play
vulture
and
that
anne
hathaway
would
play
felicia
hardy
though
she
would
not
have
transformed
into
the
black
cat
as
in
the
comics
.
instead
raimi
's
felicia
was
expected
to
become
a
brand-new
superpowered
figure
called
the
vulturess
.
however
several
years
later
raimi
stated
that
anne
hathaway
was
going
to
be
black
cat
if
spider-man

had
been
made.130
sony
pictures
announced
in
january
2010
that
plans
for
spider-man
4
had
been
cancelled
due
to
raimi
's
withdrawal
from
the
project
.
raimi
reportedly
ended
his
participation
due
to
his
doubt
that
he
could
meet
the
planned
may
6
2011
release
date
while
at
the
same
time
upholding
the
film
creatively
.
raimi
purportedly
went
through
four
iterations
of
the
script
with
different
screenwriters
and
still
``
hated
it
''
.
the
next
film
in
the
franchise
a
reboot
of
the
series
called
the
amazing
spider-man
was
released
on
