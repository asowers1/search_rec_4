the
catcher
in
the
rye
introduction
next
in
a
nutshell
over
the
course
of
three
days
a
rich
kid
who
ca
n't
stop
getting
expelled
from
every
school
he
attends
wanders
around
manhattan
trying
to
get
1
drunk
and
2
lucky.no
it
's
not
the
plot
of
an
unreleased
gossip
girl
season
rip
.
it
's
the
plot
of
catcher
in
the
rye
j.
d.
salinger
's
beloved
banned
reviled
worshiped
andâwell
letâs
just
say
polarizing
1951
novel
about
a
depressed
prep
school
boy
with
a
heart
of
gold
.
chuck
bass
meet
your
worst
nightmare.after
rocketing
almost
immediately
to
the
top
of
the
bestseller
lists
the
catcher
in
the
rye
began
its
run
on
the
banned
books
list
.
not
that
weâre
surprised
by
this
profanity
sex
alcohol
abuse
prostitutionâneed
we
go
on
but
we
are
a
little
surprised
that
itâs
also
so
common
in
high
school
english
classes
.
is
thereâs
something
more
going
on
than
the
ramblings
of
a
depressed
and
admittedly
immature
sixteen-
or
seventeen-year-oldboy
as
holden
would
say
is
there.reaching
all
the
way
back
to
the
coming-of-age
bildungsroman
tradition
the
catcher
in
the
rye
is
a
book
about
a
teenager
trying
to
find
a
way
to
be
true
to
himself
while
growing
up
in
a
world
full
of
phoniesâand
a
book
about
post-world
war
ii
america
burrowing
into
the
âphoninessâ
of
consumerism
while
trying
to
pretend
that
the
trauma
of
the
atomic
bomb
didnât
happen
.
no
wonder
the
catcher
in
the
rye
ended
up
as
a
symbol
of
alienation
and
isolation
for
the
disillusioned
and
restless
post-war
generation.and
then
thereâs
j.
d.
salinger
himself
who
stopped
publishing
and
essentially
disappeared
from
public
view
at
the
height
of
his
careerâalmost
like
he
was
a
sort
of
holden
caulfield
.
so
is
holden
really
a
stand-in
for
salinger
himself
does
holden
eventually
get
better
what
really
happened
between
his
three
days
in
new
york
and
his
ârestâ
out
westthatâs
a
secret
salinger
will
never
tell.xoxo
.
why
should
i
care
thereâs
a
lot
of
reason
to
hate
the
catcher
in
the
rye
.
maybe
youâre
a
nervous
school
administrator
who
thinks
holden
is
as
a
foul-mouthed
misanthrope
who
flunks
out
of
school
picks
up
a
hooker
borrows
money
from
his
kid
sister
to
spend
on
booze
and
ends
up
in
a
mental
hospital
.
no
wonder
mark
david
chapman
blamed
his
obsession
with
the
book
for
making
him
shoot
and
kill
john
lennon
rightor
maybe
youâre
a
teenager
who
thinks
holden
is
a
boring
whiny
hypocrite
who
despises
his
life
but
makes
zero
effort
to
change
it
.
heâs
in
love
with
a
girl
nothing
happens
.
he
goes
to
the
big
apple
nothing
happens
.
he
hires
a
prostitute
nothing
happens
.
all
that
scandal
the
censors
were
promising
it
never
happens.maybe
.
but
maybe
holden
is
just
a
confused
kid
who
obsesses
over
the
loss
of
innocence
hero-worships
his
kid
siblings
struggles
to
connect
with
anyone
his
own
age
and
thinks
all
adults
are
self-important
phonies
.
for
a
guy
who
wishes
he
could
pull
a
peter
pan
on
his
biological
clock
having
no
forward
momentum
in
the
narrative
is
kind
of
the
point
.
youâd
think
that
the
facebook
myspace
twitter
reality
tv
generation
would
be
more
receptive
to
the
ramblings
of
a
confused
17-year-old
but
many
of
todayâs
readers
seem
less
impressed
with
the
catcher
in
the
rye
than
ever
.
so
tell
us
shmooperinos
is
holden
getting
harder
to
relate
to
have
our
attention
spans
been
ruined
by
incessant
texting
and
a
140
character
limit
are
we
so
caught
up
in
telling
our
own
stories
nowadays
that
weâve
forgotten
how
to
listen

elseâs
