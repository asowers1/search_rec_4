wasikowska
as

.
when
creating
the
character
screenwriter
linda
woolverton
researched
how
young
women
were
expected
to
behave
in
the
victorian
era
and
then
made
her
the
opposite.7
wasikowska
read
carroll
's
books
as
a
child
and
re-read
them
to
prepare
for
her
role
.
she
also
watched
jan
å
vankmajer
's
alice
.
she
said
``
when
we
were
kids
my
mum
would
pop
it
in
the
vcr
player
.
we
would
be
disturbed
and
would
n't
really
understand
it
but
we
could
n't
look
away
because
it
was
too
intriguing

so
i
had
kept
that
feeling
about
alice
a
kind
of
haunting
feeling

grows
into

her

wasikowska
said
that
the
characters
``
both
feel
like
outsiders
and
feel
alone
in
their
separate
worlds
and
have
a
special
bond

burton
explained
that
depp
``
tried
to
find
a
grounding
to
the
character
...
as
opposed
to
just
being
mad
.
``

burton
also
said
that
``
in
a
lot
of
versions
it
's
a
very
one-note
kind
of
character
and
you
know

's
goal
was
to
try
and
bring
out
a
human
side

the
strangeness

depp
and
burton
decided
that
the
hatter
's
clothes

personality
and
accent
would
change
throughout
the
film
to
reflect
his
emotions.16
in
an
interview
with
depp
the
character
was
paralleled
to
``
a
mood
ring
as
his
emotions
are
very
close
to

hatter
is
``
made
up

the
actress
took
inspiration
from
her
young

nell
a
toddler
stating
that
``

according
to
hathaway
``
she
comes
from
the

she
really
likes
the
dark
side

her
interpretation

a

is
the
only

calming

dramatic

glover
said
``
the
red
queen
has
a
fair
amount
of
short-tempered
reactions

so
the
knave
has
to
be
quite
diplomatic

the
mixture

lucas
saying
that

.
her
voice
sealed
the
deal
for
her
role
as
the
character.32
stephen
fry
voiced
cheshire
the
cheshire
cat.1133
burton
stated
that
the
character
had
a
creepy
quality
in
addition
to
tapping
into
his
own
hatred
of
cats.3435
the
role
was
intended
to
be
played
by
michael
sheen
but
he
changed
his
role
to
the
white
rabbit
due
to
scheduling
conflicts
.
paul
whitehouse
voiced
thackery
earwicket
the
march
hare.11
burton
stated
that
because
whitehouse
is
a
great
comedic
actor
a
lot
of
his
lines
came
from
improvisation.36
timothy
spall
voiced
bayard
the
bloodhound
.
although
bayard
does
not
appear
in
the
book
a
similar
character
named
the
puppy
is
likely
the
inspiration
for
the
character
.
michael
gough
voiced
uilleam
the
dodo.11
burton
said
that
gough
was
the
first
person
he
thought
of
for
the
role
of
the
dodo
because
he
has
``
a
full
life
quality
to
his
voice
''
.37
the
character
only
speaks
three
lines
that
gough
recorded
in
a
day
.
unfortunately
this
would
be
gough
's
final
acting
role
where
he
passed
away
the
following
year
aged
94
.
gough
had
previously
portrayed
the
march
hare
in
the
1966
tv
play
of
the
book
.
sir
christopher
lee
voiced
the
jabberwocky
.
while
it
only
had
two
lines
burton
said
that
he
felt
lee
to
be
a
good
match
for
the
iconic
character
because
he
is
``
an
iconic
guy
''
.38
for
the
character
lee
had
originally
tried
to
make
his
voice
'burble
'
as
described
in
the
poem
``
jabberwocky
''
.
however
tim
burton
convinced
him
to
use
his
actual
voice
as
he
found
it
more
intimidating
.
imelda
staunton
voiced
all
three
of
the
talking
flowers
.
though
there
are
many
flowers
that
appear
around
wonderland
only
three
of
them
speak
and
one
of
them
is
clearly
a
caricature
of
staunton.39
staunton
only
speaks
three
lines
that
are
heard
very
briefly
at
the
beginning
of
the
film
.
jim
carter
voiced
the
red
queen
's
executioner
.
the
executioner
only
speaks
one
line
and
appears
extremely
briefly
though
carter
also
voiced
several
other
servants
to
the
red
queen
.
frank
welker
provided
additional
voices
and
vocal
effects.39
rickman
windsor
fry
gough
lee
staunton
and
carter
each
took
only
a
day
to
record
their
dialogue.39
productionedit
tim
burton
signed
with
walt
disney
pictures
to
direct
two
films
in
disney
digital
3d
which
included
alice
in
wonderland40
and
his
remake
of
frankenweenie
.
burton
developed
the
story
because
he
never
felt
an
emotional
tie
to
the
original
book.41
he
explained
``
the
goal
is
to
try
to
make
it
an
engaging
movie
where
you
get
some
of
the
psychology
and
kind
of
bring
a
freshness
but
also
keep
the
classic
nature
of
alice
.
''
on
prior
versions
burton
said
``
it
was
always
a
girl
wandering
around
from
one
crazy
character
to
another
and
i
never
really
felt
any
real
emotional
connection
.
''
his
goal
with
the
new
movie
is
to
give
the
story
``
some
framework
of
emotional
grounding
''
and
``
to
try
and
make
alice
feel
more
like
a
story
as
opposed
to
a
series
of
events
.
``
14
burton
focused
on
the
poem
``
jabberwocky
''
as
part
of
his
structure42
and
refers
to
the
described
creature
by
the
name
of
the
poem
rather
than
by
the
name
``
jabberwock
''
used
in
the
poem
.
burton
also
stated
that
he
does
not
see
his
version
as
either
a
sequel
to
any
existing
alice
film
nor
as
a
``
re-imagining
''
.41
however
the
idea
of
the
climax
of
the
story
being
alice
's
battle
with
the
queen
's
champion
the
jabberwocky
was
first
added
in
the
video
game
american
mcgee
's
alice
and
the
landscape
tower
and
weapons
and
appearance
of
alice
in
those
scenes
of
the
movie
are
very
reminiscent
of
the
same
scenes
in
the
game
.
we
wanted
somebody
who
had
...
it
's
hard
to
put
into
words
but
just
had
a
gravity
to
her
an
internal
life
something
that
you
could
see
the
wheels
turning
.
it
's
just
a
simple
kind
of
power
to
her
that
we
really
liked
.
not
flamboyant
not
very
showy
but
just
somebody
that
's
got
a
lot
of
internal
life
to
her
.
that
's
why
i
picked
her
.

though
the

filming
also
took

burton
said
that
he
used
a
combination
of
live
action
and
animation
without
motion
capture.52
he
also
noted
that
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
filmed
on

filming
of
the

portions
comprising
90
of
the

was
completed
after
only
40
days.53
many
of
the
cast

felt
nauseated
as
a
result
of
the
long
hours
surrounded
by
green
with
burton
having
lavender
lenses
fitted
into
his
glasses
to
counteract
the
effect.53
due
to
the
constant
need
for

such
as
the
size
of
the

cited
the

as
being
exhausting
saying
it

the
most
creatively
involved

burton
felt
3d
was
appropriate
to
the
story
's
environment.13
burton
and
zanuck
chose
to
film
with
conventional
cameras
and
convert
the
footage
into
3d
during
post-production
zanuck
explained
3d
cameras
were
too
expensive
and
``
clumsy
''
to
use
and
they
felt
that
there
was
no
difference
between
converted
footage
and
those
shot
in
the
format.56
james
cameron
who
released
his
3d
film
avatar
in
december
2009
criticized
the
choice
stating
``
it
