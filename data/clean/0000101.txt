september
2006
by
lims_home
singapore
see
all
my
reviews
i
first
saw
this
film
20
years
ago
.
this
was
in
the
cinema
when
it
first
came
out
.
i
was
too
young
at
that
time
to
fully
comprehend
some
of
the
subtleties
of
the
movie
.
whilst
i
enjoyed
the
whodunit
aspects
i
was
disturbed
by
some
of
the
images
that
were
presented
.
the
self-flagellation
by
savaltore
is
an
image
which
stays
in
mind
till
today
.
since
then
i
've
watched
it
every
2
years
or
so
and
the
amazing
thing
is
that
each
time
i
get
more
and
more
out
of
the
film
.
sometimes
it
's
the
greater
awareness
of
the
religious
issues
of
those
times
sometimes
it
's
because
the
actors
have
since
become
more
recognised
eg
christian
slater
ron
perlman
hellboy
.
the
cinematography
is
excellent
acting
superb
.
an
unforgettable
film
and
highly
recommended
.
