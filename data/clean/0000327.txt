biography
led
zeppelin
was
the
definitive
heavy
metal
band
.
it
was
n't
just
their
crushingly
loud
interpretation
of
the
blues
it
was
how
they
incorporated
mythology
mysticism
and
a
variety
of
other
genres
most
notably
world
music
and
british
folk
into
their
sound
.
led
zeppelin
had
mystique
.
they
rarely
gave
interviews
since
the
music
press
detested
the
band
.
consequently
the
only
connection
the
audience
had
with
the
band
was
through
the
records
and
the
concerts
.
more
than
any
other
band
led
zeppelin
established
the
concept
of
album-oriented
rock
refusing
to
release
popular
songs
from
their
albums
as
singles
.
in
doing
so
they
established
the
dominant
format
for
heavy
metal
as
well
as
the
genre
's
actual
sound
.
led
zeppelin
formed
out
of
the
ashes
of
the
yardbirds
.
jimmy
page
had
joined
the
band
in
its
final
days
playing
a
pivotal
role
on
their
final
album
1967
's
little
games
which
also
featured
string
arrangements
from
john
paul
jones
.
during
1967
the
yardbirds
were
fairly
inactive
.
while
the
yardbirds
decided
their
future
page
returned
to
session
work
in
1967
.
in
the
spring
of
1968
he
played
on
jones
'
arrangement
of
donovan
's
``
hurdy
gurdy
man
.
''
during
the
sessions
jones
requested
to
be
part
of
any
future
project
page
would
develop
.
page
would
have
to
assemble
a
band
sooner
than
he
had
planned
.
in
the
summer
of
1968
the
yardbirds
'
keith
relf
and
james
mccarty
left
the
band
leaving
page
and
bassist
chris
dreja
with
the
rights
to
the
name
as
well
as
the
obligation
of
fulfilling
an
upcoming
fall
tour
.
page
set
out
to
find
a
replacement
vocalist
and
drummer
.
initially
he
wanted
to
enlist
singer
terry
reid
and
procol
harum
's
drummer
b.j
.
wilson
but
neither
musician
was
able
to
join
the
group
.
reid
suggested
that
page
contact
robert
plant
who
was
singing
with
a
band
called
hobbstweedle
.
after
hearing
him
sing
page
asked
plant
to
join
the
band
in
august
of
1968
the
same
month
chris
dreja
dropped
out
of
the
new
project
.
following
dreja
's
departure
john
paul
jones
joined
the
group
as
its
bassist
.
plant
recommended
that
page
hire
john
bonham
the
drummer
for
plant
's
old
band
the
band
of
joy
.
bonham
had
to
be
persuaded
to
join
the
group
as
he
was
being
courted
by
other
artists
who
offered
the
drummer
considerably
more
money
.
by
september
bonham
agreed
to
join
the
band
.
performing
under
the
name
the
new
yardbirds
the
band
fulfilled
the
yardbirds
'
previously
booked
engagements
in
late
september
1968
.
the
following
month
they
recorded
their
debut
album
in
just
under
30
hours
.
also
in
october
the
group
switched
its
name
to
led
zeppelin
.
the
band
secured
a
contract
with
atlantic
records
in
the
united
states
before
the
end
of
the
year
.
early
in
1969
led
zeppelin
set
out
on
their
first
american
tour
which
helped
set
the
stage
for
the
january
release
of
their
eponymous
debut
album
.
two
months
after
its
release
led
zeppelin
had
climbed
into
the
u.s.
top
ten
.
throughout
1969
the
band
toured
relentlessly
playing
dates
in
america
and
england
.
while
they
were
on
the
road
they
recorded
their
second
album
led
zeppelin
ii
which
was
released
in
october
of
1969
.
like
its
predecessor
led
zeppelin
ii
was
an
immediate
hit
topping
the
american
charts
two
months
after
its
release
and
spending
seven
weeks
at
number
one
.
the
album
helped
establish
led
zeppelin
as
an
international
concert
attraction
and
for
the
next
year
the
group
continued
to
tour
relentlessly
.
led
zeppelin
's
sound
began
to
deepen
with
led
zeppelin
iii
.
released
in
october
of
1970
the
album
featured
an
overt
british
folk
influence
.
the
group
's
infatuation
with
folk
and
mythology
would
reach
a
fruition
on
the
group
's
untitled
fourth
album
which
was
released
in
november
of
1971
.
led
zeppelin
iv
was
the
band
's
most
musically
diverse
effort
to
date
featuring
everything
from
the
crunching
rock
of
``
black
dog
''
to
the
folk
of
``
the
battle
of
evermore
''
as
well
as
``
stairway
to
heaven
''
which
found
the
bridge
between
the
two
genres
.
``
stairway
to
heaven
''
was
an
immediate
radio
hit
eventually
becoming
the
most
played
song
in
the
history
of
album-oriented
radio
the
song
was
never
released
as
a
single
.
despite
the
fact
that
the
album
never
reached
number
one
in
america
led
zeppelin
iv
was
their
biggest
album
ever
selling
well
over
16
million
copies
over
the
next
two
and
a
half
decades
.
led
zeppelin
did
tour
to
support
both
led
zeppelin
iii
and
led
zeppelin
iv
but
they
played
fewer
shows
than
they
did
on
their
previous
tours
.
instead
they
concentrated
on
only
playing
larger
venues
.
after
completing
their
1972
tour
the
band
retreated
from
the
spotlight
and
recorded
their
fifth
album
.
released
in
the
spring
of
1973
houses
of
the
holy
continued
the
band
's
musical
experimentation
featuring
touches
of
funk
and
reggae
among
their
trademark
rock
and
folk
.
the
success
of
houses
of
the
holy
set
the
stage
for
a
record-breaking
american
tour
.
throughout
their
1973
tour
led
zeppelin
broke
box-office
records
most
of
which
were
previously
held
by
the
beatles
across
america
.
the
group
's
concert
at
madison
square
garden
in
july
was
filmed
for
use
in
the
feature
film
the
song
remains
the
same
which
was
released
three
years
later
.
after
their
1973
tour
led
zeppelin
spent
a
quiet
year
during
1974
releasing
no
new
material
and
performing
no
concerts
.
they
did
however
establish
their
own
record
label
swan
song
which
released
all
of
led
zeppelin
's
subsequent
albums
as
well
as
records
by
dave
edmunds
bad
company
the
pretty
things
and
several
others
.
physical

a
double
album
released
in
february
of
1975
was
the
band
's
first
release
on
swan
song
.
the
album
was
an
immediate
success
topping
the
charts
in
both
america
and
england
.
led
zeppelin
launched
a
large
american
tour
in
1975
but
it
came
to
a
halt
when
robert
plant
and
his
wife
suffered
a
serious
car
crash
while
vacationing
in
greece
.
the
tour

of
the
year
recuperating
from
the

the
spring
of
1976
with
presence
.
although
the
album
debuted
at
number
one
in
both
america
and
england
the
reviews
for
the
album
were
lukewarm
as
was
the
reception
to
the
live

the
song
remains
the

which

fall
of

stomach
infection
.
led
zeppelin
immediately
canceled
the
tour
and
offered
no
word
whether
or
not
it
would
be
rescheduled
causing
widespread
speculation
about
the
band
's
future
.
for
a
while
it
did
appear
that
led

were
finished
.
robert
plant
spent
the
latter
half
of
1977
and
the
better
part
of
1978
in
seclusion
.
the
group
did
n't
begin
work
on
a
new

when
they
