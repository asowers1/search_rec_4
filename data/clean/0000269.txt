i
first
heard
of
the
beatles
when
i
was
nine
years
old
.
i
spent
most
of
my
holidays
on
merseyside
then
and
a
local
girl
gave
me
a
bad
publicity
shot
of
them
with
their
names
scrawled
on
the
back
.
this
was
1962
or
'63
before
they
came
to
america
.
the
photo
was
badly
lit
and
they
did
n't
quite
have
their
look
down
ringo
had
his
hair
slightly
swept
back
as
if
he
was
n't
quite
sold
on
the
beatles
haircut
yet
.
i
did
n't
care
about
that
they
were
the
band
for
me
.
the
funny
thing
is
that
parents
and
all
their
friends
from
liverpool
were
also
curious
and
proud
about
this
local
group
.
prior
to
that
the
people
in
show
business
from
the
north
of
england
had
all
been
comedians
.
the
beatles
even
recorded
for
parlophone
which
was
a
comedy
label
as
if
they
believed
they
might
be
a
passing
novelty
act
.
i
was
exactly
the
right
age
to
be
hit
by
them
full-on
.
my
experience
seizing
on
every
picture
saving
money
for
singles
and
eps
catching
them
on
a
local
news
show
was
repeated
over
and
over
again
around
the
world
.
it
was
n't
the
first
time
anything
like
this
had
happened
but
the
beatles
achieved
a
level
of
fame
and
recognition
known
previously
only
to
charlie
chaplin
brigitte
bardot
and
elvis
presley
along
with
a
little
of
the
airless
exclusivity
of
astronauts
former
presidents
and
other
heavyweight
champions
.
every
record
was
a
shock
.
compared
to
rabid
rb
evangelists
like
the
rolling
stones
the
beatles
arrived
sounding
like
nothing
else
.
they
had
already
absorbed
buddy
holly
the
everly
brothers
and
chuck
berry
but
they
were
also
writing
their
own
songs
.
they
made
writing
your
own
material
expected
rather
than
exceptional
.
and
john
lennon
and
paul
mccartney
were
exceptional
songwriters
mccartney
was
and
is
a
truly
virtuoso
musician
george
harrison
was
n't
the
kind
of
guitar
player
who
tore
off
wild
unpredictable
solos
but
you
can
sing
the
melodies
of
nearly
all
of
his
breaks
.
most
important
they
always
fit
right
into
the
arrangement
.
ringo
starr
played
the
drums
with
an
incredibly
unique
feel
that
nobody
can
really
copy
although
many
fine
drummers
have
tried
and
failed
.
most
of
all
john
and
paul
were
fantastic
singers
.
lennon
mccartney
and
harrison
had
stunningly
high
standards
as
writers
.
imagine
releasing
a
song
like
``
ask
me
why
''
or
``
things
we
said
today
''
as
a
b
side
.
they
made
such
fantastic
records
as
``
paperback
writer
''
bw
``
rain
''
or
``
penny
lane
''
bw
``
strawberry
fields
forever
''
and
only
put
them
out
as
singles
.
these
records
were
events
and
not
just
advance
notice
of
an
album
.
then
they
started
to
really
grow
up
simple
love
lyrics
to
adult
stories
like
``
norwegian
wood
''
which
spoke
of
the
sour
side
of
love
and
on
to
bigger
ideas
than
you
would
expect
to
find
in
catchy
pop
lyrics
.
they
were
the
first
group
to
mess
with
the
aural
perspective
of
their
recordings
and
have
it
be
more
than
just
a
gimmick
.
engineers
like
geoff
emerick
invented
techniques
that
we
now
take
for
granted
in
response
to
the
group
's
imagination
.
before
the
beatles
you
had
guys
in
lab
coats
doing
recording
experiments
but
you
did
n't
have
rockers
deliberately
putting
things
out
of
balance
like
a
quiet
vocal
in
front
of
a
loud
track
on
``
strawberry
fields
forever
.
''
you
ca
n't
exaggerate
the
license
that
this
gave
to
everyone
from
motown
to
jimi
hendrix
.
my
absolute
favorite
albums
are
rubber
soul
and
revolver
.
on
both
records
you
can
hear
references
to
other
music
rb
dylan
psychedelia
but
it
's
not
done
in
a
way
that
is
obvious
or
dates
the
records
.
when
you
picked
up
revolver
you
knew
it
was
something
different
.
heck
they
are
wearing
sunglasses
indoors
in
the
picture
on
the
back
of
the
cover
and
not
even
looking
at
the
camera
.
.
.
and
the
music
was
so
strange
and
yet
so
vivid
.
if
i
had
to
pick
a
favorite
song
from
those
albums
it
would
be
``
and
your
bird
can
sing
''
.
.
.
no
``
girl
''
.
.
.
no
``
for
no
one
''
.
.
.
and
so
on
and
so
on
.
.
.
.
their
breakup
album
let
it
be
contains
songs
both
gorgeous
and
jagged
.
i
suppose
ambition
and
human
frailty
creeps
into
every
group
but
they
delivered
some
incredible
performances
.
i
remember
going
to
leicester
square
and
seeing
the
film
of
let
it
be
in
1970
.
i
left
with
a
melancholy
feeling
.
someone
recently
gave
me
an
assembly
of
newsreel
footage
which
illustrates
how
swiftly
the
band
was
drained
of
the
bright
and
joyful
wit
presented
as
a
public
face
.
in
one
early
sequence
mccartney
tells
reporters
that
they
will
soon
appear
on
the
ed
sullivan
show
and
then
points
into
the
camera
``
there
he
is
hi
ed
and
mrs.
ed
''
``
and
mr.
ed
''
chimes
ringo
.
it
might
have
been
practiced
but
it
plays
entirely
off-the-cuff
.
just
a
year
later
they
are
seen
at
a
press
conference
in
los
angeles
for
their
final
tour
.
suits
and
ties
are
a
thing
of
the
past
.
staring
down
a
series
of
dismal
attempts
at
provocation
from
the
press
corps
they
look
exhausted
and
disenchanted
.
when
probed
by
one
blowhard
to
respond
to
a
time
magazine
critique
that
``
day
tripper
''
was
about
a
prostitute
and
``
norwegian
wood
''
about
a
lesbian
mccartney
responds
``
we
were
just
trying
to
write
songs
about
prostitutes
and
lesbians
.
''
in
the
laughter
that
follows
he
mutters
``
cut
.
''
they
were
giving
the
impression
that
the
game
was
up
but
in
truth
they
were
just
getting
started
.
the
word
``
beatlesque
''
has
been
in
the
dictionary
for
quite
a
while
now
.
you
hear
them
in
harry
nilsson
's
melodies
in
prince
's
around
the
world
in
a
day
in
the
hits
of
elo
and
crowded
house
and
in
ron
sexsmith
's
ballads
.
you
can
hear
that
kurt
cobain
listened
to
the
beatles
and
mixed
their
ideas
with
punk
and
metal
.
they
can
be
heard
in
all
sorts
of
one-off
wonders
from
the
knickerbockers
'
``
lies
''
and
the
flamin
'
groovies
'
``
shake
some
action
.
''
the
scope
and
license
of
the
white
album
has
permitted
everyone
from
outkast
to
radiohead
to
green
day
to
joanna
newsom
to
roll
their
picture
out
on
a
broader
bolder
canvas
.
now
i
'll
admit
that
i
've
stolen
my
share
of
beatles
licks
but
around
the
turn
of
the
nineties
i
got
to
co-write
12
songs
with
paul
mccartney
and
even
dared
to
propose
that
he
too
reference
some
of
the
beatles
'
harmonic
signatures
as
astonishingly
he
had
made
up
another
musical
vocabulary
for
wings
and
during
his
solo
career
.
in
1999
a
little
time
after
linda
mccartney
's
passing
paul
performed
at
the
concert
for
linda
organized
by
chrissie
hynde
.
during
the
rehearsal
i
was
singing
harmony
on
a
ricky
nelson
song
with
him
and
paul
called
out
the
next
tune
``
all
my
loving
.
''
i
said
``
do
you
want
me
to
take
the
harmony
line
the
second
time
round
''
and
he
said
``
yeah
give
it
a
try
.
''
i
'd
only
had
35
years
to
learn
the
part
.
there
was
inevitably
a
poignant
feeling
to
this
song
written
long
before
he
had
even
met
linda
close
your
eyes
and
i
'll
kiss
you
tomorrow
i
'll
miss
you
remember
i
'll
always
be
true
.
at
the
show
it
was
very
different
.
the
second
paul
sang
the
opening
lines
the
crowd
's
reaction
was
so
intense
that
it
all
but
drowned
the
song
out
.
it
was
very
thrilling
but
also
disconcerting
.
perhaps
i
understood
in
that
moment
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
beatles
had
to
stop
performing
.
the
songs
were
n't
theirs
anymore
.
they
belonged
to
everybody
.
this
is
an
updated
version
of
an
essay
that
appeared
