my
review
is
brief
as
others
have
almost
said
it
all
.
i
just
want
to
say
that
i
am
62
years
old
and
just
the
thought
about
the
way
i
felt
when
i
saw
this
movie
in
the
theatre
makes
me
tear
up
.
it
is
a
nostalgic
feeling
in
a
big
way
.
reminds
you
of
your
childhood
and
those
special
feelings
about
growing
up
.
you
want
to
grow
up
and
get
on
to
being
an
adult
in
the
worst
way
but
thinking
back
now
your
childhood
was
such
a
very
special
time
.
so
fleeting
and
if
we
're
lucky
such
a
special
time
in
our
lives.i
highly
recommend
the
purchase
of
this
movie
to
add
to
your
collection.i
honestly
feel
that
the
series
should
stop
here
.
perfect
right
where
it
was
left

dvd
i
went
to
the
san
francisco
film
festival
screening
at
pixar
studios
last
night
not
really
knowing
what
to
expect
.
toy
story
has
been
with
us
for
15
years
now
20
in
terms
of
actual
development
and
i
had
a
sinking
feeling
that
maybe
all
the
character
potential
had
been
used
in
the
first
two
and
this
was
some
shameless
plot
by
disney
to
exploit
the
franchise
``
little
mermaid
3
''
anyone
.
well
shame
on
me
for
underestimating
the
capabilities
of
pixar
who
once
again
have
shown
how
a
small
studio
in
emeryville
is
a
storytelling
powerhouse
that
leaves
the
rest
of
the
industry
in
the
dust.toy
story
3
is
the
tale
of
andy
the
toys
'
owner
going
to
college
and
their
quest
to
determine
their
future
-
headed
between
the
attic
or
a
daycare
center
.
if
you
've
enjoyed
the
way
the
first
two
films
blend
character
drama
with
innovative
action
and
humor
this
cocktail
hits
its
stride
in
the
third
film
which
draws
on
everything
we
already
know
about
the
characters
and
then
adds
two
new
entire
sets
of
toys
to
the
plot
.
there
's
a
new
villain
two
very
amusing
romance
sub-plots
and
a
litany
of
visual
gags
that
push
the
envelope
even
further
.
i
'm
not
allowed
to
go
into
any
details
but
the
second
half
of
the
film
is
a
familiar
set
piece
performed
in
a
completely
new
way
that
will
forever
change
your
view
of
certain
toys
and
day
care
centers.apart
from
a
level
of
animation
that
sets
the
bar
in
the
industry
and
an
attention
to
detail
that
makes
you
wonder
what
most
``
real
''
films
actually
do
in
pre-production
the
real
genius
of
the
third
film
is
to
provide
a
satisfying
conclusion
that
gives
every
character
a
completed
character
arc.read

theme
to
its
natural
conclusion
by
showing
us
what
happens
when
the
kids
grow
up
and
leave
.
while
the
first
two-thirds
of
the
movie
are
fairly
pedestrian
for
a
pixar
movie
the
last
part
is
both
action-packed
and
emotionally
wrenching.ten
years
have
passed
and
andy
is
now
a
college-bound
teenager
.
his
toys
are
anxious
about
what
's
going

so
woody
keeps
assuring
them
that
they
'll
be
put
safely
in
the
attic
.
but
a
misunderstanding
leads
to
a
date
with
the
garbage
truck
.
since
the
toys
believe
they
have
been
abandoned
they
jump
into
the
box
of
donated
toys
bound
for
sunnyside
daycare.they
're
greeted
by
the
genial
lots-o'-hugging
bear
aka
lotso
and
the
friendly
daycare
toys
and
all
seems
to
be
well
.
but
andy
's
toys
soon
discover
that
sunnyside
is
a
nighmare
--
they
've
been
assigned
the
``
caterpillar
room
''
for
wild
abusive
toddlers
and
lotso
is
the
godfatheresque
overlord
of
the
daycare
.
once

learns
the
true
horrors
of

he
must
infiltrate

this
third
toy
story
was
a
winner
.
the
story
is
a
great
continuation
that
spoke
to
my
older
son
as
he
outgrows
his
once
beloved
woody
buzz
and
still
fascinates
my
younger
one.this
movie
centers
around
andy
all
grown
up
going
away
to
college
and
having
to
clean
out
his
bedroom
.
should
he
donate
his
old
toys
throw
them
out
or
keep
them
in
the
attic
for
his
children
woody
buzz
and
a
few
other
toys
that
have
survived
over
the
years
try
one
last
time
to
get
andy
to
play
with
them
.
their
failure
makes
them
think
they
are
doomed
for
the
trash
pile
and
rather
then
suffer
this
horrible
fate
they
plot
to
get
into
the
donate
box
.
woody
insists
that
andy
intends
for
them
to
be
stored
in
the
attic
but
the
others
do
not
believe
him.their
arrival
at
sunnyside
playschool
makes
them
think
they
've
hit
the
jackpot
but
all
is
not
as
rosy
as
it
seems
.
there
is
a
dark
undercurrent
here
lead
by
a
strawberry
smelling
stuffed
bear
.
this
brought
cries
of
horror
from
my
youngest
along
with
lots
of
questions
.
did
that
mean
the
toys
we
donated
were
being
treated
horribly
too
although
it
all
ends
well
this
part
stuck
with
my
youngest
.
i
sense
trouble
the
next
time
i
attempt
to
clean
out
his
closet
by
donating
toys
he
has
outgrown
.
thanks
disney.this
movie
attempts
to
cater
to
all
age
groups
.
the
parents
will
need
a

andy
gets
