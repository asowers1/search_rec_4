one
reviewer
here
on
amazon
was
right
on
the
money
when
he
said
that
reading
a
novel
by
umberto
eco
instantly
raises
your
iq
by
a
couple
of
points
.
the
name
of
the
rose
has
been
my
first
encounter
with
eco
's
work
and
i
was
for
the
most
part
very
impressed
with
his
skillful
murder
mystery
set
in
a
14th
century
italian
monastery.the
novel
works
on
many
levels
.
it
is
a
compelling
murder
mystery
as
young
narrator
adso
of
elk
accompanies
the
wise
william
of
baskerville
as
he
uses
logic
and
semiotics
to
not
only
solve
a
murder
mystery
but
to
decipher
labrynths
and
hidden
secrets
of
the
vast
monastery
library
.
interwoven
with
the
murder
mystery
is
a
virtual
course
on
philosophy
and
late
middle
ages
religion
as
eco
provides
detailed
accounts
of
the
histories
of
various
sects
includes
scholarly
debate
on
topics
such
as
the
poverty
of
christ
and
a
history
of
the
catholic
church
leading
to
the
establishment
of
a
papacy
in
avignon
france.one
is
reminded
of
sherlock
holmes
and
dr.
watson
as
william
and
adso
use
logic
and
determination
to
piece
together
numerous
bizarre
deaths
and
occurences
at
the
abbey
while
encountering
obstacles
and
outright
hostility
by
the
abbot
and
his
librarian
to
name
a
couple
.
the
setting
of
the
novel
and
the
glimpse
into
a
culture
that
few
of
us
can
even
imagine
is
reason
enough
to
read
the
name
of
the
rose.the
book
is
not
without
its
faults
however
.
i
think
the
book
should
stand
alone
ie
you
should
not
have
to
buy
a
separate
``
reader
's
guide
''
and
i
was
very
frustrated
at
the
numerous
latin
phrases
that
are
included
throughout
the
novel
with
no
translation
.
perhaps
this
is
more
the
fault
of
the
translator
than
eco
himself
but
it
makes
for
a
difficult
reading
experience.read

i
'd
like
to
add
to
the
many
reviews
of
this
book
only
a
few
comments
about
the
meaning
of
the
famous
latin
sentence
``
stat
rosa
pristina
nomine
nomina
nuda
tenemus
''
.
literaly
it
can
be
translated
as
``
the
ancient
rose
subsists
thanks
to
its
name
we
have
only
bare
names
''
.
it
is
an
ancient
sentence
often
quoted
by
s.c.
nominalist
philosophers
of
middle
ages
who
thought
that
our
mind
is
n't
able
to
discover
the
true
essence
of
things
and
so
it
is
n't
able
a
fortiori
to
have
the
minimum
idea
of
god
.
in
fact
in
medieval
philosophy
god
was
often
compared
to
the
figure
of
a
rose
the
nominalists
wanted
to
say
with
the
sentence
that
even
god
the
supreme
being
persists
only
through
its
name
i.e
.
persists
upon
an
extremely
frail
thing
.
names
were
seen
as
simple
``
flatus
vocis
''
``
emission
of
voice
''
without
value
.
the
nominalist
philosophers
who
declared
that
even
god
was
a
flatus
vocis
were
condemned
as
heretics
a
theme
that
recurs
often
in
the
novel
.
but
here
the
sentence
is
n't
quoted
only
for
its
historical
value
but
also
because
it
can
be
applied
also
to
the
love
of
the
young
monk
adso
he
meets
in
the
monastry
a
young
woman
and
perhaps
falls
in
love
with
her
.
in
his
mind
she
is
just
the
``
rose
''
i.e
.
god
of
whom
he
does
n't
know
the
name
the
woman
and
adso
speak
different
languages
.
it
is
then
a
very
pitiful
and
sad
thing
that
of
the
woman
he
does
n't
know
the
name
because
if
nominalist
theories
were
true
he
wo
n't
be
able
to
keep
with
him
in
his
heart
and
mind
in
his
future
life
and
old
age
the
remembrances
of
that
encounter
and
of
those
days
which
changed
his
life
and
mind
forever

touches

comedy
by
a
customer
on

2000format
paperback
it
is
november
1327
.
adso
of
melk
the
narrator
has
accompanied
william
of
baskerville
to
a
remote
wealthy
franciscan
abbey
in
the
mountains
of
northern
italy
.
upon
arriving
william
discovers
that
a
murder
has
taken
place
and
the
body
of
the
monk
adelmo
has
been
discovered
outside
the
abbey
walls
.
the
abbot
abo
is
very
concerned
and
charges
william
with
solving
the
murders
.
for
not
only
is
the
safety
of
the
monks
in
jeopardy
a
papal
delegation
from
pope
john
xxii
in
avignon
could
well
use
the
murders
as
an
excuse
for
investigating
the
abbey
something
abo
definitely
wants
to
avoid
.
by
the
time
the
papal
delegation
led
by
two
inquisitors
arrives
the
situation
at
the
abbey
has
worsened
.
two
more
monks
are
dead
and
two
more
die
soon
afterward
.
the
abbot
's
worst
fears
are
realized
when
the
papal
inquisitors
learn
he
has
been
sheltering
monks
who
were
once
followers
of
the
condemed
heretic
fra
dolcino
.
although
the
abott
dismisses
willliam
he
remains
and
a
few
hours
later
the
mystery
is
solved
two
more
monks
have
died
and
the
monastery
has
been
consumed
by
fire
.
the
name
of
the
rose
is
first
and
foremost
a
mystery
of
the
highest
order
and
it
is
possible
to
enjoy
it
on
that
level
alone
.
but
it
is
also
a
charming
roman
a
clef
something
i
think
many
readers
have
missed
.
we
do
n't
have
to
look
far
to
realize
sherlock
holmes
in
the
guise
of
william
of
baskerville
or
adso
as
dr.
watson
.
the
blind
spaniard
jorge
of
burgos
is
easily
recognized
as
the
argentinian
writer
jorge
luis
borges
.
eco
also
challenges
us
by
thinly
disguising
figures
from
postwar
italian
politics
as
various
other
members
of
the
abbey
.
the
figures
in
the
book
thus
correspond
to
other
figures
in
different
books
or
in
real
life.read
