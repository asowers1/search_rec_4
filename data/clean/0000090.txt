a
skinny
red-haired
and
freckled
orphan
girl
is
mistakenly
sent
to
live
with
a
shy
elderly
bachelor
and
his
spinster
sister
on
the
north
shore
of
canada
's
prince
edward
island
the
elderly
siblings
had
asked
to
adopt
a
young
boy
who
could
work
on
the
family
farm

the
imaginitive
and
rambunctious
anne

arrives
instead

mrs.

ponder
as
she
might
could
make
nothing
of
it
and
her
afternoon
's
enjoyment
was
spoiled
.
``
i
'll
just
step
over
to
green
gables
after
tea
and
find
out
from
marilla
where
he
's
gone
and
why
''
the
worthy
woman
finally
concluded

``
he
does
n't
generally
go
to
town
this
time
of
year
and
he
never
visits
if
he
'd
run
out
of
turnip

he
would

dress
up
and
take
the
buggy

was

enough
to

yet
something
must
have
happened
since
last
night
to
start
him
off

i
'm
clean
puzzled
that
's
what

accordingly
after

mrs.
rachel
set
out
she
had
not
far
to
go
the
big
rambling
orchard-embowered
house
where
the
cuthberts
lived

a

quarter

up

the

lured
by
the
rave
reviews
i
started
reading
this
book
.
however
though
i
am
on
page
170
i
still
could
n't
manage
to
like
anne
.
i
seem
to
be
the
only
one
who
thinks
so
but
i
must
admit
i
even
found
her
and
the
way
she
expresses
herself
irritating
.

i
love
so
much
this
book.i
think
anne
is
real
world
in
a
character
.

2011.12.28claire
when
i
started
reading
anne
of
green
gables
i
instantly
was
attached
to
the
story
...
up
to
now
i
still
ca
n't
get
enough
of
reading
and
watching
the
film
and
i
'm
already
33years
old
.
i
hope
my
daughters
will
feel
the
same
way
i
do
when
i
introduce
the
book
to
them
.
2011.12.03ezra
i
really
love
anne
of
green
gables
.
it
always
makes
me
feel
always
young
happy
and
increases
my
imagination
as
i
read
and
follow
her
life
.
sometimes
i
feel
that
i
'm
also
one
of
the
characters
in
the
story
.
ah
its
really
hard
to
explain
...
thanks
so
much
ms.
lucy
montgomery
for
creating
such
a
good
humorousimaginative
character
of
anne
.
2011.11.17rose
i
t
is
not
fair
to
categorize
this
under
children
's
book
it
is
certainly
for
all
ages
.
sometimes
i
just
cant
help
thinking
of
anne
shirley
.such
a
darling
character
she
is
.
i
had
an
imagination
as
goo
as
her
but
i
was
n't
such
a
darling
child
like
her
.
i
have
read
it
for
about
30
times
and
i
know
i
will
never
be
bored
of
reading
the
book
.
2011.11.17rashi
it
is
a
wonderful
book
and
i
think
it
should
be
in
our
school
lessons
.
school
would
be
so
interesting
then.i
can
read
it
a
hundred
times.i
wonder
why
it
is
not
known
among
my
mates
.
i
think
this
is
the
best
book
i
ever
read
.there
is
some
special
charm
in
this
book
which
can
not
be
told
in
words.i
wonder
what
makes
people
rate
other
books
as
excellent
.in
all
it
is
more
than
exellent.and
i
can
conclude
that
this
book
is
the
best
ever
without
considering
others
2011.06.02apoorva.v.c
a
beautiful
book
.
though
it
is
catogorized
under
young
readers
i
feel
it
is
for
everyone
.
o
what
amazing
and
wonderful
lines
.
i
laughed
when
anne
laughed
and
i
cried
when
anne
cried
.
it
is
so
real
to
praise
it
as
a
wonderful
imagination
.
god
am
i
relieved
after
reading
it
because
my
character
doesnt
seem
so
strange
after
knowing
my
dear
anne
...
2010.12.22emily
great
classic
for
young
women
.
a
bit
strange
but
in
a
charming
way
.

this
book
is
honestly
the
best
book
i
have
ever
read
and
im
only
12.
i
've
read
before
green
gables
and
anne
of
green
gables
.
i
am
most
definitly
going
to
keep
reading
the
wonderful
collection
because
i
am
soul
deep
interested
and
excited
to
see
what
happens
next
.

in
this
classic
canadian
children
's
story
plucky
orphan
anne
adjusts
to
life
on
the
farm
and
changes
the
lives
of
those
around
her
.
anne
evolves
in
later
stories
into
a
more
well-rounded
person
.
she
's
a
little
too
young
and
saccharine
here
.
but
this
story
has
stood
the
test
of
time
and
is
deservedly
a
classic
.

i
saw
the
tv
show
but
it
did
n't
really
get
me
until
one
day
on
vacation
a
few
years
ago
.
i
was
engrossed
in
an
exciting
action
beach
book
for
guys
when
i
heard
my
wife
reading
anne
shirley
to
our
granddaughter
.
i
think
it
was
the
part
where
uncle
matthew
meets
her
for
the
first
time
at
the
train
station
and
takes
her
home
to
green
gables
.
i
had
to
put
my
book
down
just
to
pay
attention
to
one
of
the
most
delightful
passages
in
all
literature
.
i
have
a
lump
in
my
throat
right
now
just
thinking
about
that
passage
.
since
then
i
have
read
the
book
seen
the
play
and
bought
the
t-shirt
.
and
i
'm
usually
a
guy
who
reads
things
like
tim
clancy
stephen
king
louis
lamour
.
lucy
maude
wherever
you
are
thank
you
so
much

i
first
read
this
book
back
home
in
ghana
when
i
was
about
10.
my
impression
short
version
``
one
of
the
the
best
books
i
've
ever
read
made
me
fall
in
love
with
reading
and
it
took
me
another
10
years
before
i
could
find
the
sequel
to
that
.
i
mean
its
africa
so
you
know
what
i
mean
...
i
could
n't
hide
my
joy
.
today
someone
told
me
that
it
's
a
book
for
12
year
old
girls
.
i
think
that
's
rubbish

i
owe
my
reading
life
to

''
catagory
but
i
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
reading
this
book
and
the
second
one
``
anne
of
avonlea
''
.
i
have
laughed
out
loud
at
the
mishaps
that
happen
to
anne
shirley
because
they
are
things
that
could
happen
to
any
of
us
.
it
's
very
well
written
and
you
ca
n't
help
but
fall
in
love
with
anne
.
she
's
an
intelligent
curious
plucky
little
orphan
that
captures
your
heart
right
from
the
beginning
of
the
book
.
i
plan
to
read
every
one
of
the
``
anne

books
in
the
series
.
this
one
was
an
absolute
pleasure
