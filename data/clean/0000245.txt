its
unpredictable
risks

all
young
fish
is
eager
to
explore

reef

into
a
tacky
dentists
office
fish

nemo_about_the_movie
the
story
process
part
of
the
inspiration
for
finding
nemo
can
be
traced
to
writer-director
andrew
stantons
childhood
memory
of
the
fish
tank
in
his
dentists
office
and
his
sympathy
for
the
fish
.
another
piece
came
years
later
when
stanton
was
the
father
of
a
five-year-old
boy
and
realized
the
danger
of
being
an
overprotective
parent
.
between
the
two
memories
stanton
had
the
emotional
anchor
for
the
film
and
the
pixar
team
had
the
perfect
new
realm
for
a
cg
adventure

''
i
grew
up
in
massachusetts
by
the
sea
and
i
remember
going
to
my
family
dentist
who
had
this
funky
fish
tank
in
his
office
.
all
kids
are
attracted
to
aquariums
and
i
remember
staring
at
this
tank
and
thinking
what
a
weird
view
of
the
world
this
must
be
for
the
fishits
like
flying
into
las
vegas
and
thats
your
first
view
of
america
