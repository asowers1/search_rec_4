the

summary
after
the
success
of
the
hobbit
j.r.r
.
tolkien
duly
set
pen
to
paper
and
began
what
would
be
the
first
chapter
of
the
lord
of
the
rings
but
it
would
be
another
twelve
years
before
he
would
complete
it
stating
``
my
work
has
escaped
from
my
control
and
i
have
produced
a
monster
...
it
is
not
really
a
sequel
to
the
hobbit
but
to
the
silmarillion
.
''
another
four
years
passed
while
the
``
monster
''
was
tirelessly
worked
on
and
in
1954
the
first
part
of
this
towering
work
the
fellowship
of
the
ring
was
published
.
four
months
after
this
the
two
towers
appeared
and
eleven
months
later
the
return
of
the
king
.
it
would
be
over
a
decade
before
the
lord
of
the
rings
became
available
in
a
single
volume
now
it
can
be
read
and
enjoyed
in
paperback
