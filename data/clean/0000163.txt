see
all
my
reviews
i
attended
a
special
screening
for
toy
story
3
.
i
went
in
with
high
expectations
.
i
loved
the
first
two
toy
stories
movies
.
toy
story
is
a
beloved
franchise
that
almost
everyone
that
i
know
loves
the
first
two
films
.
now
how
about
the
3rd
film
well
all
i
could
say
is
that
it
lived
up
to
my
unbelievably
high
expectations
and
then
some
.
this
is
such
a
good
film
.
it
has
the
laughs
magic
and
best
of
all
the
entertainment
.
the
new
characters
in
the
movie
feel
like
they
were
in
the
previous
two
films
they
were
that
engaging
and
really
worked
well
in
the
movie
.
the
best
part
of
the
movie
has
to
be
the
ending
i
almost
cried
and
was
moved
to
just
about
to
tears
.
i
truly
believe
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
trilogies
of
all
time
.
it
might
even
rival
the
lord
of
the
rings
trilogy.this
movie
has
a
real
chance
to
become
the
first
animated
film
to
win
best
picture
.
i
surely
would
not
be
surprised.1010
an
amazing
end
to
a
fantastic
series
