to

unfinished
as
the
writers
did
not
want

to
compromise
what
they
had
written
so
verbinski
worked
with
james
byrkit
to
storyboard
major
sequences
without

of

while
elliott

wrote
a
``

script
for

finished

the
crew
began
shooting
at
dominica
a
location
verbinski
had
selected
as
he
felt
it
fitted
the
sense
of
remoteness
he
was
looking
for.7
however
this
was
also
a
problem
the
dominican
government
were
completely
unprepared
for
the
scale
of
a
hollywood
production
as
while
the
500-strong
crew
occupying
around
90
of
the
roads
on
the
island
they
had
trouble
moving
around
on
the
underdeveloped
surfaces
.
the
weather
also
alternated
between
torrential
rainstorms
and
hot
temperatures
the
latter
of
which
was
made
worse
for
the
cast
who
had
to
wear
period
clothing
.
at
dominica
the
sequences
involving
the
pelegosto
and
the
forest
segment
of
the
battle
on
isla
cruces
were
shot
.
verbinski
preferred
to
use
practical
props
for
the
giant
wheel
and
bone
cage
sequences
feeling
long
close-up
shots
would
help
further
suspend
the
audience
's
disbelief.5
dominica

also
used
for

the
crew
moved
to
grand
bahama
island
to
shoot
ship
exteriors
including
the
working
black
pearl
and
flying
dutchman
.
filming
there
was
a
tumultuous
period
starting
with
the
fact
that
the
tank
had
not
actually
been
finished
.
the
hurricane
season
caused
many
pauses
in
shooting
and
hurricane
wilma
damaged
many
of
the
accessways
and
pumps
though
no
one
was
hurt
nor
were
any
of

destroyed.5

the
three
stages
of
animating
bill
nighy
's
character
.
the
flying
dutchmanâ'âs
crew
members
were
originally
conceived
by
writers
ted
elliott
and
terry
rossio
as
ghosts
but
gore
verbinski
disliked
this
and
designed
them
as
physical
creatures.18
their
hierarchy
is
reflected
by
how
mutated
they
were
newcomers
had
low
level
infections
which
resemble
rosacea
while
veterans
had
full-blown
undersea
creature
attributes
.
verbinski
wanted
to
keep
them
realistic
rejecting
a
character
with
a
turtle
shell
and
the
animators
watched
various
david
attenborough
documentaries
to
study
the
movement
of
sea
anemones
and
mussels.19
all
of
the
crew
are
computer-generated
with
the
exception
of
stellan
skarsgãrd
who
played
``
bootstrap
''
bill
turner
.
initially
his
prosthetics
would
be
augmented
with
cgi
but
that
was
abandoned.20
skarsgãrd
spent
four
hours
in
the
make-up
chair
and
was
dubbed
``
bouillabaisse
''
on
set.21
captain
davy
jones
had
originally
been
designed
with
chin
growths
before
the
designers
made
the
move
to
full-blown
tentacles22
the
skin
of
the
character
incorporates
the
texture
of
a
coffee-stained
styrofoam
cup
among
other
elements
.
to
portray
jones
on
set
bill
nighy
wore
a
motion
capture
tracksuit
that
meant
the
animators
at
industrial
light
magic
did
not
have
to
reshoot
the
scene
in
the
studio
without
him
or
on
the
motion
capture
stage
.
nighy
wore
make-up
around
his
eyes
and
mouth
to
splice
into
the
computer-generated
shots
but
the
images
of
his
eyes
and
mouth
were
not
used
.
nighy
only
wore
a
prosthetic
once
with
blue-colored
tentacles
for
when
will
turner
orlando
bloom
steals
the
key
to
the
dead
man
's
chest
from
under
his
``
beard
''
as
he
sleeps
.
to
create
the
cg
version
of
the
character
the
model
was
closely
based
on
a
full-body
scan
of
nighy
with
jones
reflecting
his
high
cheekbones
.
animators
studied
every
frame
of
nighy
's
performance
the
actor
himself
had
blessed
them
by
making
his
performance
more
quirky
than
expected
providing
endless
fun
for
them
.
his
performance
also
meant
new
controls
had
to
be
stored
.
finally
jones
'
tentacles
are
mostly
a
simulation
though
at
times
they
were
hand-animated
when
they
act
as
limbs
for
the
character.23
the
kraken
was
difficult
to
animate
as
it
had
no
real-life
reference
until
animation
director
hal
hickel
instructed
the
crew
to
watch
king
kong
vs.
godzilla
which
had
a
real
octopus
crawling
over
miniatures.24
on
the
set
two
pipes
filled
with
30000
pounds
of
cement
were
used
to
crash
and
split

richard
