at
times
to

the
rabbits
grow
exhausted
however
and
they
decide
to
rest
.
hazel
realizes
they
are
tense
and
nervous
so
he
asks
dandelion
to
tell
them
a
story.dandelion
tells
a
story
about
el-ahrairah
the
rabbit
folk
hero
.
the
story
goes
that
when
the
world
was
first
made
all
of
the
animals
were
friends
and
the
rabbits
populated
the
entire
earth
.
but
then
frith
the
sun
god
who
created
the
world
told
el-ahrairah
to
stop
his
people
from
multiplying
.
el-ahrairah
responds
that
his
people
are
the
strongest
in
the
world
.
frith
then
decides
to
trick
el-ahrairah
and
he
tells
all
of
the
animals
to
come
get
a
gift
.
to
foxes
stoats
weasels
and
many
other
animals
frith
gave
gifts
of
cunning
and
strength
to
hunt
rabbits
.
el-ahrairah
heard
this
and
decided
to
hide
as
he
realizes
lord
frith
can
not
be
tricked
.
he
began
to
dig
a
hole
but
at
that
moment
frith
came
upon
him
.
frith
seeing
the
rabbit
asks
if
he
has
seen
el-ahraira
's
as
he
has
a
gift
to
bestow
upon
him
.
the
prince
then
tells
him
that
he
would
be
given
the
gift
.
so
lord
frith
blesses
el-ahrairah
's
tail
.
the
prince
of
the
rabbits
that
he
would
have
a
thousand
enemies
but
that
they
would
have
to
catch
him
and
that
if
his
people
were
crafty
they
would
survive
.
a
lendri
badger
surprises
the
rabbits
and
they
run
away
from
it
.
then
they
come
to
a
river
that
fiver
decides
they
need
to
cross
but
they
are
unsure
if
they
can
.
to
the
rabbits
the
river
seems
immense
but
on
the
other
side
are
fields
that
look
much
better
than
they
woods
where
they
have
been.hazel
knows
that
the
other
rabbits
may
not
want
to
cross
the
river
but
fiver
tells
him
that
they
must
.
bigwig
wants
to
know
what
they
are
going
to
do
and
blackberry
convinces
him
to
swim
across
and
take
a
look
at
the
other
side
to
make
sure
it
is
safe
.
bigwig
comes
hurrying
back
to
tell
them
that
there
is
a
dog
loose
in
their
wood
.
hazel
realizes
they
must
get
across
but
pipkin
is
hurt
and
will
not
be
able
to
swim
.
blackberry
figures
out
a
way
to
float
fiver
and
pipkin
on
a
piece
of
wood
and
they
all
get
across
safely
.
blackberry
's
discovery
mystifies
all
of
the
other
rabbits
except
fiver
who
understands
what
happened.the
rabbits
come
across
a
bean
field
and
settle
down
there
for
a
while
to
rest
.
the
rabbits
are
awakened
from
their
sleep
by
the
sound
of
a
gunshot
and
they
scatter
all
about
the
field
.
hazel
and
silver
return
to
the
spot
where
they
were
all
sleeping
and
slowly
the
others
come
back
as
well
.
they
set
off
across
the
field
but
hazel
soon
stops
when
he
sees
a
car
coming
along
a
road
.
he
does
not
know
about
roads
and
bigwig
explains
to
him
that
the
hrududil
cars
are
not
dangerous
during
the
day
but
that
at
night
their
lights
are
so
bright
that
they
make
it
impossible
to
move.the
rabbits
continue
on
for
some
time
in
unfamiliar
terrain
until
hawkbit
acorn
and
speedwell
come
to
hazel
and
tells
him
that
they
want
to
go
back
.
hazel
tells
them
how
ridiculous
such
an
idea
is
and
before
he
can
explain
why
they
can
not
go
back
fiver
comes
to
talk
to
him
.
bigwig
yells
at
the
three
insubordinates
.
fiver
in
a
trance
tells
hazel
his
vision
of
where
they
need
to
go
to
some
hills
that
are
very
far
away
.
fiver
says
they
are
in
for
trouble
on
the
way
but
that
they
need
to
get
to
the
hills
.
hazel
is
dubious
because
of
the
distance
and
worried
about
what
they
will
do
.
when
fiver
comes
to
himself
and
asks
what
he
was
talking
about
hazel
tells
him
to
forget
it.hazel
knows
that
acorn
speedwell
and
hawkbit
are
unhappy
because
of
the
way
bigwig
has
kept
them
in
line
and
he
knows
they
need
to
rest
and
find
a
place
to
settle
down
.
although
hazel
is
unsure
of
himself
he
promises
he
will
take
the
others
to
a
better
place
soon
.
they
travel
through
difficult
terrain
for
hours
and
just
when
it
seems
they
can
go
no
further
they
come
upon
a
perfect
field.the
rabbits
laze
about
contentedly
in
the
field
and
begin
to
scratch
out
a
few
holes
.
they
do
not
work
very
seriously
however
since
real
digging
such
as
warrens
and
burrows
is
done
by
does
female
rabbits
and
they
are
all
bucks
.
soon
they
see
a
strange
rabbit
looking
at
them
.
hazel
and
blackberry
go
to
speak
to
him
.
the
very
large
rabbit
who
seems
unconcerned
that
they
wish
to
stay
and
comes
over
to
meet
the
rest
of
the
group
puzzles
them
.
his
name
is
cowslip
and
he
invites
them
to
stay
in
his
warren
which
has
many
empty
burrows
.
he
runs
off
before
the
rain
comes
and
the
group
talks
it
over
.
everyone
thinks
that
there
is
no
danger
except
fiver
who
believes
they
should
stay
away
.
hazel
decides
they
will
go
to
cowslip
's
warren.cowslip
's
warren
is
strangely
conspicuous
and
hazel
leads
his
rabbits
down
into
it
.
they
come
to
a
huge
burrow
where
all
of
the
rabbits
from
the
warren
are
gathered
.
hazel
's
group
quickly
mixes
among
them
except
fiver
who
sits
apart
.
hazel
goes
off
with
a
rabbit
named
strawberry
who
tells
him
that
they
never
have
to
deal
with
any
elil
enemies
because
the
man
who
lives
nearby
often
shoots
them
.
strawberry
shows
hazel
around
but
seems
to
dodge
hazel
's
questions
and
shows
him
a
form
of
stone
artwork
that
bewilders
hazel
as
most
rabbits
do
not
create
art
.
he
realizes
that
strawberry
will
not
answer
any
question
beginning
with
the
word
``
where
.
``
they
return
to
the
big
hall
and
hazel
wants
to
talk
to
blackberry
alone
.
he
tells
cowslip
they
are
going
to
silflay
eat
outside
but
cowslip
tells
them
that
they
have
plenty
of
food
inside
and
that
it
is
raining
outside
anyway
.
when
hazel
insists
cowslip
laughs
at
them
.
laughter
is
foreign
to
rabbits
and
hazel
and
blackberry
run
outside
puzzled
.
they
meet
pipkin
and
the
three
of
them
discuss
how
strange
these
rabbits
seem
to
be
.
they
go
back
downstairs
and
fall
asleep.the
rabbits
are
awakened
by
strawberry
stamping
and
calling
out
to
wake
everyone
.
he
explains
that
there
is
flayrah
good
food
outside
.
the
rabbits
all
go
outside
and
find
carrots
in
the
field
.
they
eat
their
fill
and
then
cowslip
explains
how
to
carry
some
food
back
to
the
warren
for
later
.
hazel
sees
the
angry
fiver
who
tells
him
that
there
is
something
unnatural
about
the
warren
.
fiver
slept
outside
and
will
not
join
them
and
hazel
is
worried.hazel
sees
bigwig
later
and
although
they
both
agree
the
warren
is
strange
they
have
been
treated
well
and
they
see
no
reason
to
alter
things
.
bigwig
forces
fiver
to
come
down
into
the
burrow
with
them
.
the
other
rabbits
ask
for
a
story
and
after
a
discussion
blackberry
says
that
hazel
will
describe
their
adventures
.
the
rabbits
are
silent
and
hazel
's
group
confers
again
and
decides
that
dandelion
should
tell
another
story
of
el-ahrairah.in
the
great
burrow
dandelion
tells
the
story
of
a
time
when
el-ahrairah
and
his
people
were
down
on
their
luck
and
living
in
marshland
where
there
was
little
food
.
el-ahrairah
convinced
prince
rainbow
whom
frith
had
placed
in
charge
of
the
world
to
let
his
people
out
of
the
marshes
if
he
could
steal
king
darzin
's
lettuces
.
king
darzin
had
a
great
animal
kingdom
and
his
lettuce
garden
was
heavily
guarded
but
along
with
his
friend
rabscuttle
the
captain
of
his
owsla
el-ahrairah
pulled
off
the
trick
.
and
from
that
day
on
rabbits
could
not
be
kept
out
of
vegetable
gardens
as
they
always
had
a
trick
for
the
occasion.hazel
and
his
gang
are
sure
that
dandelion
has
made
a
favorable
impression
because
he
has
told
a
classic
rabbit
story
and
told
it
very
well
.
however
they
soon
realize
that
the
reception
they
have
received
is
not
very
enthusiastic
.
they
learn
that
these
rabbits
do
not
tell
the
traditional
stories
and
that
they
believe
that
rabbits
need
dignity
not
tricks
.
one
of
the
new
rabbits
silverweed
a
young
poet
recites
a
disturbingly
beautiful
poem
about
movement
and
life
and
it
affects
fiver
greatly
.
he
writhes
in
agony
and
tries
to
escape
only
to
injure
the
other
rabbits
.
hazel
follows
him
out
along
with
bigwig
.
fiver
thinks
they
have
come
out
with
him
because
they
also
senses
what
the
entire
warren
is
a
trap
but
he
is
startled
to
learn
that
they
are
only
upset
because
he
may
have
endangered
their
relationship
with
cowslip
and
the
other
rabbits
.
they
bully
fiver
into
going
back
underground
to
sleep.hazel
wakes
up
realizes
that
fiver
is
not
there
and
goes
angrily
with
bigwig
to
find
him
.
fiver
tells
them
he
is
leaving
.
hazel
tells
bigwig
he
must
go
with
fiver
a
little
way
to
hear
what
he
has
to
say
and
to
try
to
convince
him
to
come
back
.
bigwig
yells
at
fiver
because
he
believes
that
fiver
is
acting
foolish
and
teases
him
about
his
visions.bigwig
turns
to
go
back
to
the
warren
and
gets
caught
in
a
snare
.
he
struggles
furiously
until
hazel
tells
him
he
is
in
a
snare
and
bigwig
mouths
that
they
need
to
get
the
peg
out
.
fiver
runs
for
help
and
brings
the
others
.
blackberry
finds
the
peg
and
they
get
it
out
but
bigwig
remains
still
and
silent
.
they
learn
that
cowslip
and
all
the
others
would
not
come
help
and
that
they
ignored
fiver
when
he
went
for
help
.
hazel
believing
bigwig
has
died
says
a
small
prayer
.
suddenly
bigwig
gets
up
claiming
that
he
will
go
kill
cowslip.the
rabbits
become
enraged
and
go
to
kill
the
others
but
fiver
silences
them
all
and
tells
them
the
story
he
has
pieced
together
.
the
snares
are
there
for
the
rabbits
set
out
by
the
farmer
who
feeds
them
and
protects
them
from
elil
.
the
rabbits
know
about
the
snares
but
they
pretend
everything
is
all
right
and
come
up
with
art
and
poetry
to
pass
their
time
.
fiver
convinces
them
the
warren
is
a
death
trap
and
they
are
about
to
leave
when
strawberry
comes
running
up
and
begs
them
to
take
him
with
them
.
hazel
agrees
and
they
leave.by
the
evening
of
the
next
day
the
rabbits
have
travelled
over
three
miles
.
they
trust
each
other
more
after
their
experience
in
the
last
warren
and
fiver
's
intuitions
are
no
longer
questioned
.
they
rest
in
a
barn
where
they
are
attacked
by
rats
but
silver
and
buckthorn
fight
them
off
under
bigwig
's
guidance
.
finally
the
rabbits
come
to
the
foot
of
the
downs
and
fiver
wants
them
to
climb
up
to
the
top
.
hazel
dandelion
and
hawkbit
go
ahead
and
scope
out
the
territory
.
hazel
and
dandelion
find
that
the
top
of
the
downs
is
perfect
for
them
and
hawkbit
finds
some
rabbit
holes
on
the
way
up
that
will
be
great
places
for
them
to
sleep
that
night.the
rabbits
sleep
well
that
night
.
the
next
day
blackberry
suggests
to
hazel
that
they
build
a
warren
for
themselves
.
although
this
is
normally
a
task
for
does
not
bucks
they
decide
that
it
is
a
good
idea
anyway
and
begin
working
.
later
hazel
bigwig
dandelion
and
speedwell
go
down
the
hill
to
find
some
good
grass
.
soon
they
hear
a
terrible
sound
one
that
they
can
not
place
.
they
hide
together
but
then
the
voice
begins
to
speak
words
and
it
calls
bigwig
.
shocked
hazel
bravely
goes
to
see
what
it
could
be
.
with
dandelion
behind
him
he
finds
a
rabbit
in
terrible
shape
on
the
verge
of
collapse창it
is
captain
holly
of
the
sandleford
owsla
from
their
home
warren.hazel
realizes
that
they
are
in
danger
as
the
injured
holly
smells
of
blood
and
will
attract
predators
.
soon
another
rabbit
appears창holly
's
friend
bluebell
.
hazel
manages
to
get
holly
and
bluebell
up
to
the
top
of
the
down
without
any
trouble
although
it
takes
a
while
and
he
is
very
worried
.
pipkin
and
dandelion
take
the
two
injured
rabbits
into
one
of
the
holes
and
tell
the
others
to
leave
them
be
to
rest
as
much
as
they
need.the
next
day
hazel
takes
the
others
back
to
continue
digging
the
new
warren
which
he
wants
to
have
a
great
burrow
like
the
one
in
strawberry
's
old
warren
.
soon
strawberry
takes
control
of
the
building
process
using
his
knowledge
from
the
other
warren
to
help
build
the
great
burrow
which
they
call
the
honeycomb
.
hazel
saves
a
mouse
from
a
falcon
by
telling
it
in
the
simple
woodland
language
to
come
down
into
one
of
their
holes.captain
holly
has
recovered
enough
to
tell
them
his
story창one
that
he
warns
will
drive
fear
into
all
of
their
hearts창but
before
he
does
so
the
mouse
speaks
to
hazel
.
the
mouse
promises
to
help
hazel
sometime
in
return
for
saving
his
life
earlier.holly
tells
them
that
after
they
left
the
threarah
explained
that
even
if
fiver
were
right
in
his
premonition
to
move
an
entire
warren
is
a
tremendous
undertaking
.
the
threarah
pointed
out
that
it
is
almost
always
better
to
stay
underground
and
try
to
dodge
the
dangers
than
to
pick
up
and
leave
as
many
rabbits
could
not
make
a
long
journey
and
predators
would
come
from
far
around.a
few
days
later
holly
was
out
on
his
own
and
when
he
came
back
he
saw
a
group
of
men
and
a
boy
with
a
gun
.
the
men
filled
in
many
of
the
holes
and
then
put
poisonous
gas
into
each
of
the
holes
they
had
left
open
.
bluebell
picks
up
the
story
and
describes
the
terror
inside
the
burrows
.
rabbits
panicked
and
mothers
fought
with
any
who
came
near
their
young
.
bluebell
managed
to
find
a
path
that
went
far
down
into
the
earth
and
came
out
of
a
hole
in
the
woods
along
with
another
rabbit
pimpernel
who
was
in
bad
shape.before
they
escaped
holly
tells
them
a
great
plough
came
and
destroyed
the
field
.
then
with
the
two
other
rabbits
he
followed
the
path
that
hazel
had
taken
.
the
trail
lead
them
near
the
warren
of
the
snares
where
they
took
shelter
in
a
small
ditch
.
upon
awakening
they
are
surrounded
by
cowslip
and
the
others
who
attacked
them
and
managed
to
kill
pimpernel
who
was
sick
and
unable
to
defend
himself
but
holly
and
bluebell
managed
to
escape
.
holly
attacked
cowslip
and
would
have
killed
him
but
cowslip
told
him
where
hazel
and
the
others
had
gone
.
they
went
on
without
sleeping
and
by
the
end
holly
was
delirious
and
hallucinating
.
it
was
at
that
point
that
hazel
found
him.after
holly
's
story
is
finished
hazel
begins
to
clean
his
ear
out
and
tells
them
why
he
saved
the
mouse
.
he
figures
that
it
can
not
hurt
to
befriend
other
animals
who
are
enemies
of
their
enemies
.
they
go
out
to
eat
and
hawkbit
tells
hazel
that
another
mouse
told
him
of
a
place
where
there
is
very
good
grass
to
eat
.
they
go
eat
and
hazel
is
pleased
that
helping
the
mouse
paid
off.bluebell
then
tells
a
story
about
el-ahrairah
that
took
place
soon
after
the
story
that
dandelion
told
about
the
king
's
lettuce
.
prince
rainbow
wanted
to
put
el-ahrairah
back
in
his
place
so
he
brought
a
rabbit
named
hufsa
to
live
with
him
and
made
rabscuttle
live
somewhere
else
.
hufsa
spoiled
all
of
el-ahrairah
's
plans
by
secretly
telling
prince
rainbow
about
them
.
el-
ahrairah
finally
tricked
hufsa
into
looking
like
a
fool
and
managed
to
steal
prince
rainbow
's
new
carrots
in
the
process
.
he
went
with
hufsa
to
steal
the
carrots
but
made
so
many
other
animals
do
so
many
strange
things
along
the
way
that
no
one
believed
hufsa
's
story
at
the
trial
.
the
jury
made
up
entirely
of
elil창the
enemies
of
rabbits창acquitted
el-ahrairah
and
prince
rainbow
took
hufsa
away
.
bigwig
and
silver
find
an
injured
bird
in
a
hollow
.
the
bird
is
a
black-
headed
gull
something
the
rabbits
have
never
seen
before
.
hazel
goes
with
them
to
look
at
the
bird
talks
to
it
in
the
same
dialect
that
he
used
with
the
mouse
and
decides
that
it
is
hungry
.
they
collect
worms
and
other
insects
and
bring
them
to
the
gull
.
after
feeding
the
bird
hazel
tries
to
convince
it
that
they
want
to
help
it
.
the
bird
wants
nothing
to
do
with
them
however
so
they
leave.later
that
afternoon
hazel
convinces
the
bird
to
come
and
stay
in
a
hole
that
they
could
build
for
it
.
while
the
other
rabbits
dig
the
hole
hazel
explains
to
the
bird
the
way
they
live
.
by
the
next
day
the
bird
is
much
better
and
much
friendlier
and
bigwig
becomes
its
constant
companion
.
bigwig
tells
the
others
that
a
cat
injured
the
bird
's
wing
and
that
the
bird
comes
from
a
place
far
away
where
the
earth
stops
and
is
followed
by
so
much
water
that
no
land
can
be
seen
.
the
rabbits
are
impressed
and
incredulous
but
bigwig
is
sure
the
bird
whose
name
is
kehaar
is
not
lying.as
they
learn
about
the
bird
hazel
tells
the
others
of
his
plan
.
he
points
out
that
they
have
no
does
in
the
warren
and
unless
they
find
some
their
new
warren
will
have
been
built
in
vain
.
hazel
wants
kehaar
to
find
some
does
as
the
bird
can
travel
farther
much
faster
than
the
rabbits
could
.
bigwig
says
he
will
work
on
it.a
few
days
later
when
kehaar
is
better
he
comes
to
hazel
and
presents
his
plan창the
bird
will
go
and
find
females
for
the
rabbits
.
kehaar
leaves
and
returns
after
several
days
telling
them
that
there
are
rabbits
in
a
farm
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
.
he
also
tells
of
a
warren
he
found
that
would
take
them
a
few
days
to
reach
.
they
decide
to
send
an
expedition
to
the
warren
to
try
to
bring
back
some
does
.
holly
silver
buckthorn
and
strawberry
set
off
the
next
morning.that
night
hazel
decides
that
he
should
see
about
securing
a
few
does
before
the
expedition
comes
back
.
he
sets
off
with
pipkin
to
look
at
the
rabbits
on
the
farm
.
inside
the
shed
with
the
rabbits
hazel
has
pipkin
keep
watch
for
cats
while
hazel
talks
to
the
rabbits
.
he
meets
boxwood
who
tells
him
there
are
two
does
and
two
bucks
.
hazel
tells
them
he
wants
them
to
join
the
warren
and
he
promises
to
come
back
and
free
them
.
just
then
pipkin
warns
him
that
a
cat
is
outside
.
hazel
waits
for
the
cat
to
approach
and
then
goads
it
into
jumping
at
them
.
the
rabbits
take
off
getting
away
just
in
the
nick
of
time
.
pipkin
asks
hazel
why
he
went
to
talk
to
the
rabbits
and
hazel
says
that
he
will
explain
later.the
next
day
fiver
finds
out
about
hazel
's
adventure
to
the
farm
and
fiver
is
angry
because
he
believes
that
holly
will
bring
back
plenty
of
does
and
that
hazel
is
simply
acting
like
a
show-off
.
hazel
disagrees
with
his
brother
and
later
on
he
and
pipkin
tell
the
others
about
the
visit
.
bigwig
is
excited
to
go
and
he
and
hazel
convince
blackberry
to
come
with
them
to
figure
out
how
to
open
the
rabbit
hutch
.
dandelion
speedwell
and
hawkbit
are
also
to
go
along
.
fiver
warns
hazel
that
he
foresees
danger
for
him
so
hazel
promises
he
will
not
go
into
the
farmyard
himself.they
leave
the
next
evening
.
at
the
end
of
the
barn
the
rabbits
stumble
upon
a
cat
different
from
the
one
hazel
and
pipkin
met
earlier
.
dandelion
scratches
the
cat
only
a
moment
before
bigwig
hits
it
rolls
over
it
and
kicks
it
several
times
sending
the
cat
running
.
blackberry
figures
out
a
way
to
rip
the
leather
hinge
and
they
free
the
other
rabbits
.
but
the
rabbits
in
the
hutch
are
not
certain
whether
to
follow
the
others
or
not
.
two
of
them
boxwood
and
clover
try
to
move
quickly
but
the
other
two
haystack
and
laurel
hang
back
.
soon
the
other
cat
arrives
and
the
dog
begins
barking
.
the
rabbits
run
off
leaving
laurel
behind.they
get
to
hazel
who
tells
them
to
continue
on
.
hazel
goes
back
with
dandelion
to
get
the
other
two
.
suddenly
a
car
pulls
up
blinding
the
rabbits
with
light
.
the
men
grab
laurel
and
the
other
rabbits
run
off
.
while
the
men
search
the
rabbits
get
stuck
in
a
ditch
.
hazel
runs
out
to
distract
the
men
so
the
others
can
get
away
and
he
is
shot
.
he
crawls
up
the
drain
and
hides.the
other
rabbits
gather
together
and
wait
for
hazel
and
then
dandelion
and
bigwig
go
down
to
look
for
him
.
they
see
the
blood
and
the
men
's
footsteps
and
they
go
back
to
tell
the
others
.
the
rabbits
make
the
march
back
to
the
downs
to
meet
fiver
who
already
knows
about
hazel
's
ordeal
from
a
vision
.
later
that
night
holly
comes
back
with
buckthorn
strawberry
and
silver
.
only
silver
is
unhurt
.
the
rabbits
have
no
does
with
them.fiver
has
a
dream
in
which
he
learns
that
hazel
is
still
alive
.
fiver
asks
blackberry
if
he
knows
where
hazel
was
shot
and
he
tells
blackberry
to
take
him
to
that
spot
.
even
though
blackberry
is
sure
that
hazel
must
be
dead
fiver
convinces
him
to
go
.
they
return
to
the
farm
fiver
rushing
as
fast
as
he
can
and
telling
blackberry
to
hurry
up
.
fiver
moves
through
the
ditch
and
follows
the
trail
of
blood
to
the
drain
.
he
looks
in
the
drain
and
sees
that
hazel
is
inside
and
that
he
is
still
alive.deprived
of
their
leader
the
rabbits
are
uncertain
of
themselves
and
do
not
know
what
to
do
.
holly
tells
the
story
of
what
happened
on
their
journey
to
the
warren
that
kehaar
told
them
about
.
they
bumped
into
a
rabbit
who
told
them
not
to
go
to
efrafa
the
warren
but
just
then
three
big
rabbits
approached
them
and
escorted
them
in.the
owsla
in
efrafa
are
in
complete
control
along
with
a
council
of
advisers
owsla
and
a
rabbit
named
general
woundwort
is
the
leader
.
each
of
the
rabbits
is
marked
and
then
put
in
a
group
with
a
similar
mark
and
they
only
go
above
ground
with
their
group
.
the
warren
is
designed
to
avoid
detection
because
the
rabbits
fear
humans
.
the
owsla
run
a
``
wide
patrol
''
창they
move
far
away
from
the
warren
looking
for
enemies
or
wandering
rabbits.a
rabbit
called
captain
campion
took
holly
and
the
others
into
a
burrow
where
they
learned
about
the
warren
by
talking
to
the
rabbits
especially
a
doe
named
hyzenthlay
who
told
them
that
the
warren
was
overcrowded
.
they
were
brought
before
the
council
and
holly
tried
to
explain
that
they
just
wanted
a
few
does
for
their
own
warren
.
however
general
woundwort
explained
to
them
that
they
were
to
stay
in
efrafa창they
quickly
realized
that
they
were
prisoners
not
guests.holly
came
up
with
a
plan
to
escape
and
they
ran
away
while
their
guard
was
eating
outside
.
they
were
soon
pursued
however
and
they
knew
they
would
be
overtaken
.
only
climbing
over
one
side
of
a
railroad
track
saved
them
although
holly
did
not
know
what
the
track
was
.
the
train
came
through
and
cut
them
off
from
the
efrafan
owsla
.
holly
describes
the
train
as
a
giant
hrududu
sent
by
lord
frith
himself
to
save
them
.
they
managed
to
make
their
way
back
to
the
warren
only
to
learn
that
hazel
was
killed
in
the
raid
on
the
barn.blackberry
comes
and
tells
them
that
hazel
is
alive
and
that
he
is
with
fiver
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
.
bigwig
runs
down
to
help
and
finds
hazel
sleeping
.
the
next
morning
kehaar
comes
down
and
pulls
the
shotgun
pellets
out
of
hazel
's
leg
.
hazel
spends
three
days
resting
and
tells
holly
and
the
rest
what
they
need
to
do
.
they
need
to
return
to
efrafa
and
bring
back
some
does
and
hazel
wants
blackberry
to
figure
out
how
to
do
it.hazel
returns
the
next
morning
and
tells
the
rabbits
that
he
plans
to
go
to
efrafa
and
get
some
does
.
holly
speaks
out
against
the
plan
saying
it
is
suicide
.
but
then
fiver
says
that
he
will
go
and
claims
that
he
thinks
it
will
work
.
bigwig
also
says
that
he
is
going
and
that
kehaar
is
coming
with
them
.
silver
and
pipkin
volunteer
and
then
blackberry
comes
in
and
says
that
the
plan
is
better
than
he
originally
thought
.
kehaar
tells
hazel
he
will
help
them
to
find
the
does
but
that
he
must
leave
afterwards
.
he
promises
to
return
another
time
in
the
future.the
rabbits
set
out
on
their
quest
for
efrafan
does
leaving
behind
only
buckthorn
strawberry
holly
and
the
hutch
rabbits
.
hazel
wants
to
find
a
hiding
place
close
to
efrafa
and
kehaar
comes
and
tells
him
they
can
hide
on
the
other
side
of
the
nearby
river
.
they
ask
dandelion
to
tell
a
story
and
bigwig
requests
el-ahrairah
and
the
black
rabbit
of
inl찾.dandelion
tells
the
story
of
a
time
when
king
darzin
sent
his
soldiers
to
get
rid
of
el-ahrairah
once
and
for
all
.
the
soldiers
attacked
the
rabbits
as
soon
as
they
came
out
of
their
holes
and
soon
all
of
el-ahrairah
's
people
were
miserable
.
el-ahrairah
could
not
figure
out
a
way
to
get
rid
of
king
darzin
and
he
realized
he
needed
special
help
.
he
decided
to
seek
out
the
black
rabbit
of
inl찾
an
immortal
rabbit
appointed
by
lord
frith
to
determine
the
deaths
of
all
rabbits
.
el-ahrairah
wanted
to
offer
the
black
rabbit
his
own
life
in
exchange
for
help
for
his
people.after
a
long
journey
with
his
friend
rabscuttle
el-ahrairah
came
to
the
dwelling
of
the
black
rabbit
and
tried
to
bargain
with
him
but
the
black
rabbit
would
not
accept
his
offer
.
el-ahrairah
tried
to
trick
the
black
rabbit
but
he
lost
his
whiskers
his
tail
and
his
ears
in
the
process
.
finally
the
black
rabbit
told
el-ahrairah
to
leave
and
said
that
he
had
already
gotten
rid
of
king
darzin
's
soldiers
.
rabscuttle
and
el-ahrairah
made
their
way
home
getting
lost
and
having
many
adventures
on
the
way
.
when
they
finally
returned
the
warren
was
bigger
and
the
younger
rabbits
knew
nothing
about
the
war
with
king
darzin
.
in
fact
they
thought
war
itself
was
foolish
.
el-ahrairah
sat
to
think
and
lord
frith
came
to
talk
to
him
telling
him
that
wisdom
is
not
easy
and
brought
him
a
tail
whiskers
and
a
pair
of
ears
with
starlight
in
them
.
just
then
pipkin
interrupts
the
story
to
tell
the
others
that
there
is
a
fox
approaching.hazel
gathers
everyone
to
run
from
the
fox
but
just
at
that
moment
bigwig
rushes
past
him
draws
the
fox
's
attention
and
runs
into
the
undergrowth
.
they
hear
a
rabbit
squeal
and
then
surprisingly
bigwig
comes
running
back
.
hazel
is
angry
with
him
but
bigwig
says
he
needed
to
do
something
because
he
was
very
tense
.
he
tells
hazel
that
when
he
went
into
the
brush
with
the
fox
behind
him
he
bumped
into
three
strange
rabbits
.
he
told
them
to
run
but
they
tried
to
stop
him
so
he
knocked
one
of
them
down
and
then
ran
off
.
he
figures
the
fox
must
have
gotten
the
rabbit
that
he
knocked
down.the
rabbits
move
on
through
the
night
.
in
the
morning
kehaar
comes
and
tells
them
that
there
is
a
patrol
nearby
that
will
find
them
soon
if
they
do
not
hide
.
they
cross
over
the
iron
road창the
railroad
tracks창that
holly
told
them
about
and
kehaar
tells
them
they
are
safe
.
the
rabbits
go
to
sleep.hazel
realizes
that
bigwig
's
stunt
with
the
fox
probably
broke
up
a
wide
patrol
that
was
very
close
to
finding
them
.
he
asks
kehaar
to
take
them
to
the
river
which
is
huge
and
awes
the
rabbits
.
the
need
to
get
to
the
other
side
so
kehaar
shows
them
the
way
to
a
bridge
.
fiver
reassures
hazel
that
the
bridge
is
no
worse
than
many
other
places
they
have
been
and
is
in
fact
better
than
some
.
fiver
and
hazel
go
across
first
with
pipkin
and
soon
silver
and
dandelion
follow
.
many
of
the
other
rabbits
are
even
more
reluctant
than
hazel
to
cross
and
fiver
has
to
convince
them
all
to
come
over
.
they
check
out
the
terrain
and
then
sleep.blackberry
and
hazel
need
to
figure
out
the
last
step
in
the
plan
.
they
explore
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
find
a
smaller
bridge
further
down
the
river
.
they
cross
it
along
with
fiver
bigwig
and
bluebell
.
they
come
upon
a
boat
which
kehaar
explains
to
them
and
blackberry
strikes
upon
using
the
boat
themselves
.
the
plan
is
complete
and
hazel
tells
bigwig
it
is
time
for
him
to
go
.
bigwig
pauses
for
a
moment
and
then
takes
off.general
woundwort
is
a
huge
fearless
rabbit
who
has
fought
many
types
of
elil
in
the
past
.
he
created
efrafa
because
he
craved
power
and
he
fully
controlled
it
from
the
beginning
.
he
used
the
wide
patrols
to
systematically
gain
control
over
the
area
surrounding
efrafa
and
he
made
his
warren
very
safe
.
the
patrols
were
also
used
to
train
rabbits
to
become
fierce
and
cunning
.
woundwort
himself
sometimes
joins
the
patrols.however
the
general
is
concerned
because
holly
and
his
group
's
escape
hurt
the
prestige
of
the
owsla
and
also
caused
the
death
of
a
good
captain
the
one
who
was
hit
by
the
train
.
furthermore
the
fox
led
on
by
bigwig
killed
another
of
woundwort
's
best
officers
.
captain
campion
one
of
woundwort
's
officers
comes
to
tell
him
that
they
have
found
a
rabbit
who
wants
to
join
efrafa.the
rabbit
is
bigwig
although
woundwort
does
not
know
him
.
bigwig
convinces
the
general
that
he
would
be
a
good
addition
to
the
warren
and
woundwort
makes
him
an
officer.bigwig
learns
about
the
efrafa
security
and
begins
to
think
that
his
task
may
be
close
to
hopeless
.
he
meets
the
rabbit
blackavar
who
tried
to
escape
but
was
caught
by
campion
.
blackavar
was
hurt
very
badly
and
he
is
left
out
as
a
public
demonstration
.
bigwig
decides
that
if
he
brings
anyone
out
blackavar
is
coming
with
them
.
bigwig
meets
hyzenthlay
and
some
other
does
and
later
he
has
her
come
to
see
him
.
he
talks
to
hyzenthlay
and
tells
her
that
he
plans
to
break
some
does
out
of
efrafa
.
she
is
intelligent
and
helpful
and
tells
him
that
they
must
leave
in
the
next
two
nights
because
after
that
their
mark
does
not
go
out
at
night
.
they
settle
on
the
next
night
and
she
is
to
tell
the
does
just
before
they
go
out
to
eat.one
of
the
officers
wakes
bigwig
up
and
he
heads
out
to
feed
with
his
mark
.
outside
he
sees
kehaar
and
while
eating
talks
to
the
bird
.
he
tells
kehaar
that
the
rabbits
must
be
ready
at
sunset
and
that
he
must
attack
the
sentries
.
bigwig
goes
to
tell
hyzenthlay
and
her
friend
thethutinnang
about
the
plan
.
just
as
bigwig
gets
ready
to
make
the
break
that
night
general
woundwort
calls
him
aside
to
talk
to
him.woundwort
questions
bigwig
because
one
of
the
officers
from
the
patrol
bigwig
encountered
while
running
from
the
fox
has
recognized
him
.
bigwig
explains
to
woundwort
that
he
did
not
bring
the
fox
on
them
intentionally
.
woundwort
asks
him
if
he
knows
anything
about
the
other
rabbits
that
his
patrol
was
tracking
.
bigwig
says
that
he
saw
their
tracks
but
otherwise
has
no
idea
where
they
went
.
woundwort
invites
bigwig
to
go
on
a
wide
patrol
with
him
two
days
later
and
then
tells
him
to
keep
an
eye
on
hyzenthlay
because
there
may
be
more
trouble.hazel
and
the
other
rabbits
realize
that
something
must
have
gone
wrong
.
they
return
to
the
other
side
of
the
river
trying
to
keep
their
spirits
up
.
bigwig
is
very
worried
and
to
add
to
his
troubles
he
learns
that
hyzenthlay
and
thethutinnang
have
told
the
other
does
to
be
ready
.
he
is
worried
that
one
of
them
will
talk
and
that
they
will
be
found
out
.
the
next
morning
bigwig
finds
a
way
to
send
a
message
to
kehaar
by
using
another
officer
as
his
unwitting
pawn
.
he
tells
the
bird
to
come
back
that
night
.
later
bigwig
finds
blackavar
apart
from
his
escort
for
a
moment
and
tells
him
to
be
ready
to
break
later
that
night.hazel
and
the
others
get
bigwig
's
message
through
kehaar
and
prepare
to
meet
him
.
hyzenthlay
wakes
bigwig
up
to
tell
him
that
a
doe
has
been
arrested
.
he
tells
her
to
gather
the
others
quickly
and
goes
to
get
blackavar
.
bigwig
attacks
one
of
blackavar
's
escorts
while
the
prisoner
fights
with
the
other
.
bigwig
knocks
down
both
escorts
and
then
takes
off
with
blackavar
and
the
does
right
behind
him
.
they
hear
stamping
and
know
that
the
efrafans
have
spotted
their
escape.woundwort
learns
what
has
happened
and
takes
off
after
them
.
campion
tries
to
get
bigwig
to
stop
but
they
continue
on
.
soon
however
the
general
and
his
men
catch
up
to
them
.
just
when
the
escapees
turn
to
fight
lightning
flashes
giving
everyone
pause
.
it
begins
to
pour
and
then
kehaar
attacks
out
of
nowhere
.
the
other
rabbits
come
to
bigwig
and
the
does
'
aid
and
they
make
a
hasty
retreat
towards
the
river.woundwort
and
his
rabbits
come
at
them
from
one
side
while
campion
comes
from
the
other
.
now
all
the
rabbits
are
on
the
boat
except
dandelion
who
is
hiding
in
the
bushes
and
woundwort
comes
to
kill
them
all
injuring
a
doe
thrayonsla
in
the
process
tearing
the
right
side
of
her
face
off
.
hazel
says
they
must
leave
but
bigwig
cries
out
that
kehaar
is
there
.
woundwort
leaps
back
and
dandelion
jumps
on
the
boat
.
the
force
breaks
the
already
frayed
rope
and
the
rabbits
drift
away
from
woundwort
and
efrafa.the
rabbits
float
down
the
river
wondering
what
to
do
next
.
kehaar
tells
them
that
there
is
a
bridge
coming
and
that
they
might
not
fit
under
it
.
they
squeeze
through
the
bridge
but
one
of
the
does
is
hurt
as
they
go
under
.
they
come
to
another
bridge
that
stops
the
boat
.
kehaar
tells
them
to
jump
out
and
swim
underneath
the
bridge
and
he
does
so
himself
just
to
show
them
that
it
is
safe
.
hazel
does
not
know
whether
kehaar창s
advice
is
sound
for
rabbits
but
then
a
group
of
men
passes
over
the
bridge
and
hazel
realizes
how
unsafe
their
position
is
.
he
and
pipkin
jump
into
the
water
and
blackavar
follows
behind
them
.
once
safe
on
land
blackavar
points
out
that
they
can
walk
around
to
the
other
side
.
from
there
they
tell
the
others
that
it
is
safe
to
jump
.
although
some
of
the
does
need
convincing
they
finally
all
jump
in
drift
to
the
shore
and
fall
asleep.in
the
morning
they
learn
that
the
doe
who
was
injured
thrayonsla
going
under
the
bridge
has
died
during
the
night
.
hazel
and
bigwig
say
goodbye
to
kehaar
who
takes
off
for
the
ocean
promising
to
return
in
the
winter
.
then
the
rabbits
set
off
on
the
road
home
.
blackavar
proves
himself
very
useful
because
from
his
efrafan
training
he
knows
how
to
track
very
well
.
at
one
point
hazel
wants
to
stop
and
dig
some
holes
to
stay
in
for
a
few
days
and
fiver
is
not
opposed
to
doing
so
.
blackavar
feels
that
they
are
in
fox
country
but
bigwig
disagrees
and
hazel
decides
they
should
rest.two
days
later
a
fox
grabs
one
of
the
does
.
the
group
moves
on
.
they
stumble
upon
captain
campion
who
only
sees
a
few
of
them
and
tries
to
get
them
to
surrender
but
soon
realizes
he
is
outnumbered
.
hazel
prepares
to
go
past
without
any
force
but
blackavar
tells
him
they
must
kill
the
patrol
or
else
it
will
report
back
to
efrafa
.
they
move
on
without
fighting
and
make
their
wake
back
to
their
warren
at
the
downs
.
campion
and
his
patrol
who
have
looped
back
behind
them
see
the
warren
and
then
go
back
to
efrafa
to
report.everyone
is
content
in
the
warren
.
the
sixteen
bucks
manage
to
get
along
with
only
ten
does
and
they
are
all
pleased
to
be
once
again
living
normal
rabbit
lives
.
they
persuade
dandelion
to
tell
them
a
story
and
he
tells
them
about
the
time
that
el-ahrairah
and
rabscuttle
played
a
trick
on
rowsby
woof
a
vicious
dog
so
that
they
could
eat
some
good
food
.
el-ahrairah
dressed
up
and
pretended
to
be
the
fairy
wogdog
a
spirit
sent
by
the
dog
queen
.
el-ahrairah
and
rabscuttle
got
their
food
and
left
rowsby
woof
convinced
that
he
saved
both
his
master
and
the
fairy
wogdog
from
an
evil
rat
spirit.after
dandelion
finishes
his
story
he
goes
to
take
over
the
sentry
post
from
acorn
.
hazel
goes
with
him
and
is
visited
by
his
mouse
friend
who
brings
news
of
other
rabbits
gathered
close
by
.
bigwig
wants
to
talk
to
hazel
and
ignores
the
mouse
but
hazel
asks
the
mouse
to
repeat
its
message
and
then
insists
on
sending
holly
and
blackavar
to
check
.
speedwell
comes
out
happily
to
tell
them
that
clover
has
had
a
litter
of
six
kittens.bigwig
chats
happily
with
hazel
but
then
holly
and
blackavar
come
running
back
.
they
bring
news
that
a
huge
raiding
party
has
come
from
efrafa
.
they
have
bumped
into
campion
and
they
think
woundwort
himself
may
be
there
.
hazel
decides
to
fill
in
the
holes
leading
into
the
burrows
so
their
enemies
will
have
to
dig
them
out
leaving
one
hole
open
to
enter
and
exit
.
hazel
decides
to
go
try
to
talk
to
general
woundwort
and
he
makes
bigwig
chief
rabbit
until
he
returns.we
learn
that
woundwort
's
authority
was
damaged
after
bigwig
engineered
the
great
escape
and
he
was
determined
to
get
revenge
.
he
set
up
campion
to
look
for
the
escapees
at
the
spot
where
the
fox
ruined
their
earlier
patrol
.
after
learning
where
the
warren
was
he
set
up
an
expedition.once
woundwort
learns
that
the
rabbits
have
been
spotted
he
takes
a
few
of
his
own
rabbits
with
him
to
look
at
what
the
enemy
is
doing
.
hazel
comes
forward
and
offers
a
compromise
.
he
suggests
that
they
create
a
warren
between
efrafa
and
the
downs
made
up
of
rabbits
from
each
warren
.
woundwort
barely
considers
hazel
's
offer
before
telling
him
that
if
all
the
does
blackavar
and
bigwig
are
not
waiting
when
he
gets
there
then
he
will
kill
all
of
the
bucks.while
the
efrafans
struggle
to
get
through
bigwig
suggests
to
hazel
that
they
move
everyone
into
the
burrows
behind
the
honeycomb
and
then
block
the
entrances
.
that
way
once
they
are
in
the
efrafans
will
have
to
get
through
bigwig
to
get
to
the
rest
of
the
warren
.
fiver
falls
into
some
sort
of
trance
screams
and
hazel
has
a
vision
he
needs
to
go
to
the
farm
and
free
the
dog
.
he
takes
blackberry
and
dandelion
with
him
and
they
fly
out
of
the
open
hole.woundwort
moves
down
into
the
burrow
and
prepares
to
attack
.
bigwig
has
had
to
leave
fiver
on
the
other
side
because
he
would
not
wake
up
but
woundwort
thinks
fiver
is
dead
and
leaves
him
alone
.
woundwort
brings
in
more
rabbits
and
they
see
the
newly
formed
wall
at
one
end
of
the
hall
.
when
they
break
through
woundwort
steps
in
first
and
bigwig
who
has
buried
himself
below
the
entrance
bites
deep
into
the
general
's
leg
.
woundwort
scratches
back
and
then
advance
.
bigwig
rips
into
the
leg
again
but
then
woundwort
comes
down
on
top
of
him
and
takes
control
.
just
as
woundwort
goes
for
the
kill
his
leg
gives
out
and
he
falls
backward
receiving
a
few
blows
from
bigwig
as
he
moves
back.dandelion
takes
off
with
the
dog
behind
him
.
after
a
brief
rest
in
the
cattle
shed
he
manages
to
keep
the
dog
following
him
up
to
where
blackberry
is
waiting
.
he
draws
the
dog
out
of
the
gate
but
then
it
seems
to
lose
interest
.
finally
it
starts
up
the
hill
at
a
slow
trot
.
dandelion
catches
up
and
together
the
two
rabbits
get
the
dog
's
attention
.
it
charges
after
them.woundwort
tries
to
get
bigwig
to
move
but
bigwig
knows
that
even
his
dead
body
will
be
a
major
obstacle
as
it
will
block
the
way
.
finally
woundwort
jumps
at
bigwig
and
pushes
him
backwards
.
bigwig
struggles
but
is
slowly
pushed
back
when
suddenly
woundwort
loses
strength
.
bigwig
's
blows
have
caused
woundwort
's
nose
to
bleed
and
he
can
not
breathe
as
he
tries
pushing
bigwig
.
finally
the
general
lets
go
and
retreats
.
his
troops
are
incredulous
and
when
he
sends
one
rabbit
vervain
in
to
finish
off
bigwig
the
rabbit
is
too
scared
to
go
and
makes
up
an
excuse
of
having
grit
in
his
eye
.
woundwort
decides
to
work
from
another
angle
leaving
bigwig
there
.
he
