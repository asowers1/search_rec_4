mass
market
paperback
when
i
was
in
high
school
i
was
a
mean
black
leather
wearing
heavy
metal
girl
.
a
long
time
friend
forced
me
against
my
will
to
read
the
first
``
anne
''
book
and
my
life
has
been
so
much
more
beautiful
ever
since
.
these
books
made
me
see
the
magical
beauty
in
nature
bosom
friends
family
imagination
and
even
crabby
old
ladies
this
last
has
come
in
handy
on
many
occasions
.
i
now
have
made
a
point
of
buying
the
set
for
every
girl
i
consider
a
friend
.
i
am
now
23
and
when
i
have
children
of
my
own
girls
or
boys
i
will
read
them
``
anne
''
as
soon
as
they
can
understand
what
i
am
saying
.
if
you
liked
the
``
anne

books
i
would
also
recommend
books

cd
as
another
reviewer
i
too
have
enjoyed
the
book
and
the
dvds
immensely
but
i
have
also
grown
to
really
enjoy
audio
books
.
looking
for
an
audiobook
about
a
simpler
time
i
decided
to
buy
the
audio
version
of
anne
of
green
gables
.
but
the
first
version
i
purchased
read
by
shelly
frasier
just
did
n't
bring
the
book
to
life
for
me
.
ms.
frasier
seemed
bored
with
the
passages
describing
the
beautiful
flowers
or
some
other
such
delights
.
so
i
looked
for
another
version
.
i
then
bought
the
version
read
by
susan
o'malley
.
it
was
better
but
anne
still
did
n't
have
the
energy
i
was
longing
for
.
so
i
tried
once
more
and
purchased
this
version
which
is
in
my
opinion
the
best
of
the
three
.
the
reader
seems
to
actually
enjoy
the
beauty
of
the
world
as
much
as
anne
does
.
sometimes
the
voice
sounds
just
slightly
too
``
old
''
for
anne
's
actual
age
but
the
enthusiasm
is
captured
wonderfully
.
if
you
love
listening
to
audiobooks
in
the
car
to
pass
the
time
during
long
commutes
this
is
the
version
i
would
recommend
-
to
all
kindred
spirits
.

this

a
republishing
of
the
original
work
with
original

the

readers
below
do

is
that
the
typos

are
part
of
the
truth
about
how
this

.
it
was
neither

nor
expected
to
do
well
although
the
publishers
--
and
the
author
--
were
quickly
proven
to
have
underestimated
the

condition
of

i
first
loved
the
``
anne-girl
''
books
at
12
or
13
.
since
then
whenever
i
am
feeling
glum
i
re-read
the
detail-filled
tales
of
an
orphan
girl
from
pei
with
a
vivid
imagination
and
an
enviable
wholly
positive
outlook
on
life
.
i
recently
realized
that
i
skipped
volumes
5
and
6
so
it
was
a
real
treat
to
go
back
to
read
them
i
could
relate
better

i
loved
this
movie
as
a
kid
but
had
never
read
the
book
.
it
seems
like
it
would
be
great
but
it
was
a
bit
too
wordy
for
my
little
ones
.
we
will
wait
a
bit
longer
and
try
again
