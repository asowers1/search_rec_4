down
the
50
best

songs
and
26
artists
weigh
in
on
the
groups
legacy
.
writer
matthew
wake
examines
mick
taylorthe
stone
who
rolled
awayand
his
place
in
the
bands
history
.
in
addition
to
an
interview
with
the
band
from
1982
and
plenty
more
stones
content
this
weeks
sampler
includes
tracks
from
the
postelles
baroness
icky
blossoms
and
moreso
get
yer
ya-yas
out
and
help
us
toast
to
a
half-century
of
one
of
our
favorite
bands
.
if
you
want
to
get
technical
about
it
the
rolling
stones
have
been
around
for
much
longer
than
50
years
.
sure
it
was
july
12
1962
when
they
played
their
first
gig
and
they
wouldnt
invade
the
states
for
a
few
more
years
but
the
american
blues
and
soul
music
they
drew
inspiration
from
had
already
been
around
for
decades
at
that
point
.
the
rolling
stones
are
more
than
mick
jagger
keith
richards
charlie
watts
ronnie
wood
and
their
rotating
cast
of
bandmates
.
the
stones
are
robert
johnson
theyre
chuck
berry
theyre
muddy
waters
.
theyre
something
intangiblea
renegade
spirit
that
turns
up
in
nearly
a
century
of
music
.
and
just
as
that
outlaw
aesthetic
has
been
around
for
far
longer
than
the
band
itself
the
rolling
stones
will
be
around
for
much
longer
than
50
years
.
theyve
changed
their
tune
over
the
years
hopping
from
blues
and
pop
to
psychedelia
country
rock
even
trying
their
hand
at
disco
.
they
borrowed
heavily
from
the
greats
that
came
before
them
and
pooled
all
their
influences
into
a
perfect
storm
of
grit
and
musicality
.
no
matter
what
your
musical
tastes
are
you
can
likely
find
a
stones
track
youll
enjoy
and
that
versatility
is
part
of
what
makes
the
stones
so
enduring
.
the
following
list
required
lots
of
listening
to
the
stones
over
the
past
couple
of
months
a
great
way
to
prepare
for
our
special
rolling
stones
issue
of
the
paste
magazine
mplayer
.
but
while
were
celebrating
half
a
century
of
the
rolling
stones
today
its
important
to
remember
that
the
band
isnt
just
a
number
.
the
rolling
stones
are
a
way
of
lifeone
thatll
still
be
around
long
after
were
all
dead
and
gone
.
here
are
the
50
best
rolling
stones
songs
50
.
shes

this
1967
track
off
of
their
satanic
majesties
request
returned
to
prominence
recently
when
kristen
wiig
danced
to
it
with
mick
jagger
and
her
castmates
during
her
emotional
snl
farewell
sketch
and
theres
nothing
satanic-sounding
about
this
pretty
baroque-inspired
tune.bonnie

as

by
as

is
arguably
the
track
that
started
it
all
the
song
is
the
very
first
jagger-richards
original

it
that
manager
andrew

locked

twins
in
a

and
instructed
them
not
to
come
out
until
they
had
something
with
brick
walls
all
around
it
high
windows
and
no
sex
.
the
result
is
a
pop
ballad
that
stands
out
against
the
bands
racier
materialand
its
a
damn
good
one
that
proved
to
mick
and
keef
that
the
whole
songwriting
thing
was
something
they
could
handle
.
it
was
a
shock
this
fresh
world
of
writing

own
material
this
discovery
that
i
had
a
gift

had

this

perhaps
the
best
example
of
the
important
roles
in
the
group
played
by
those
who
arent
named

came
up

in
