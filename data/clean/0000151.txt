i
am
more
giddy
than
my
giddy
aunt
.
i
saw
the
midnight
showing
of
the
avengers
last
night
and
at
the
end
my
face
hurt
and
warped
from
grinning
so
big
.
i
am
so
wired
i
ca
n't
form
a
coherent
thought
.
here
's
a
salvo
of
stream-of-consciousness
impressions
in
whatever
order.mark
ruffalo
is
simply
terrific
as
the
hulk
's
alter
and
calmer
ego
.
i
actually
prefer
his
interpretation
of
dr
.
banner
over
bana
's
and
norton
's
.
ruffalo
steers
away
from
the
deadening
angst
that
made
me
fidget
in
earlier
hulk
pictures
.
he
finds
a
balance
.
this
banner
exhibits
a
dry
sense
of
humor
but
exudes
this
quirky
low
simmer
edginess
.
and
i
love
ruffalo
's
interactions
with
downey
jr.
two
swaggerful
eggheads
matching
their
test
tubes
against
each
other
and
applying
big
sciency
words
.
i
like
that
there
's
respect
between
their
two
characters
.
there
's
an
intriguing
twist
involving
banner
's
relationship
with
the
hulk
of
which
i
wo

blu-ray
do
n't
get
me
wrong
it
's
one
of
my
favorite
movies
and
i
highly
recommend
it
as
a
blu-ray
purchase
for
any
action
andor
hero
fan
.
the
problem
is
that
this
4
disc
set
is
nothing
but
a
sham
and
on
multiple
levelsdigital
copyfirst
the
only
supported
tablet
is
the
ipad
so
for
all
of
us
android
tablet
users
do
n't
dream
about
taking
the
movie
with
you
on
the
go
through
legitimate
means.in
fact
even
if
you
choose
the
wmp
version
which
can
only
be
seen
on
your
computer
you
might
face
difficulties
.
my
laptop
apparently
needed
a
security
update
which
i
could
n't
get
no
matter
how
much
i
tried
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
's
running
on
the
latest
version.digital
music
downloadwhy
not
simply
include
the
music
within
the
set
in
mp3
files
here
's
why
.
although
you
've
already
paid
a
higher
price
for
a
set
that
should
provide
the
soundtrack
they
feel
that
you
still
have
n't
actually
paid
enough
.
after
giving
my
authentication
code
online
i
was
asked
for
personal
contact
info
.
wth
i
have
enough
spam
mail
as
it
is
i
decided
to
give
it
a
shot
and
give
my
email
address
at
risk
of
getting
flooded
by
unwanted
ads.what
message
did
i
get
upon
punching
in
my
zip
code
``
not
available
in
some
regions
''
.
never
mind
that
i
purchased
it
at
a
local
retail
store.this
set
i
assume
should
only
be
sought
out
by
those
who
actually
have
a
full
3d
home
theater
set
.
even
then
i
fell
as
though
everything
listed
after
dvd
in
features
is
false
advertising.i
bought
the
set
yesterday
and
today
i
'm
going
back
to
my

to
get
my
money
back
and

do

my
thoughts
on
seeing
this
movie
--
the
first
time
yes
you
will
go
to
see
this
more
than
once
--
were
``
this
was
just
as
good
as
'the
dark
knight
'
...
.how
is
that
even
possible
''
well
...
consider
first
that
marvel
has
always
had
the
best
storylines
and
the
know-how
to
mix
all
of
their
characters
'
comic
books
together
into
one
all-encompassing
storyline
.
then
consider
they
decided
to
apply
said
formula
to
their
movies
.
third
they
went
out
and
expertly
casted
the
parts.how
could
this
not
be
goodwho
else
but
robert
downey
jr
could
be
a
multi-billionaire
techno-wizard
armor-wearing
snark-artist
acts
like
he
does

care

is
willing
to
sacrifice
his
life
to
save

.brings
``
a
little
old-fashioned
''
to
the
role
and
shows
old-fashionedness
is
n't
cheesy
it
just
depends
on
how
it
is
presented
.
it
is
presented
very
well
with
evans
being
the
heart
and
soul
not
to
mention
team
leader
of
the

--
by
the

adds
a

of
world-weariness

his
over-the-shoulder
``

is
one
of
my
favorite
moments
in
