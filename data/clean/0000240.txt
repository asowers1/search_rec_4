may
that
marko
is
the
one
who
killed
ben
parker
and
a
vengeful
peter
waits
for

again
.
the
symbiotic
bonds
with
his
costume
while
he
is
asleep
peter
discovers
that
not
only
has
his
costume
changed
but
his
powers
have
been
enhanced
as
well
.
the
black
suit
also
alters
peter
's
personality
making
him
more
violent
and
spiteful
exemplified
by
a
near
lethal
attack
on
sandman
during
a
battle
underground
.
the
shift
in

with

peter
is
victorious
in
a
brutal

which
leaves

works
.
peter
gets
into
a
fight
with

the
floor
.
peter
realizes
the
symbiotic-suit
is
changing
him
for
the
worse
.
he
runs
out
of
the
nightclub
and
goes
to
a
church
bell
tower
to
get
rid
of
it
.
initially
he
is
unable
to
pull
the
suit
off
but
the
sound
of
the
church
bell
weakens
the
symbiotic
enabling
peter
to
break
free
.
eddie
brock
is
at
the
same
church
praying
for
peter
's
death
when
the
symbiotic
falls
from

tower
and
takes
over
his
body
.
the
newly-empowered
eddie
finds
sandman
and
suggests
that
they
join
forces
to
destroy

the
pair
use

jane
as
bait
to
force
spider-man
to
confront
them
.
peter
approaches
harry
for
help
but
is
turned
down
.
however
harry
learns
the
truth
about
his
father
's
death
from
his
butler
bernard
and
arrives
in
time
to
rescue
peter
teaming
up
against
brock
and
sandman
.
as
the
fight
progresses
brock
attempts
to
impale
peter
with
the
glider
but
harry
sacrifices
himself
and
is
fatally
wounded
.
peter
recalls
how
the
church
bell
's
toll
weakened
the
symbiotic
and
frees
eddie
from
it
by
clanging
several
pipes
together
.
peter
throws
a
pumpkin
bomb
at
the
symbiotic
just
as
eddie
attempts
to
rebond
with
it
killing
him
and
destroying
the
symbiotic
.
after
the
battle
marko
tells
peter
that
he
had
no
intention
of
killing
ben
parker
and
that
it
was
an
accident
born
out
of
a
desperate
attempt
to
save
his
daughter
's
life
.
peter
forgives
marko
who
dissipates
and
floats
away
.

forgive
each
other
before

dies
with

peter
at
his
side
