is
at

since

at.near

chapter
xxvi
the

''
in

of

hardcover
this
is
just
a
note
to
say
beware
of
the
new
translation
if
you
've
previously
read
and
enjoyed
the
katherine
woods
version
.
mr.
howard
makes
the
argument
in
his
``
translator
's
note
''
that
the
language
has
changed
since
the
1940
's
and
that
a
new
translation
is
needed
.
i
could
n't
disagree
more
.
and
i
do
speak
with
some
experience
on
this
subject
i
read
this
title
at
school
in
the
original
french
language
for
three
different
classes
as
well
as
numerous
times
in
english
the
woods
version
.
katherine
woods
beautifully
captured
the
feel
of
the
french
original
.
the
new
howard
translation
is
in
a
more
modern
english
which
mostly
succeeds
at
removing
the
poetry
that
previously
existed
and
little
else
that
i
can
find
.
it
does
not
make
the
story
any
more
clear
or
nuanced
than
it
previously
was
rather
less
so
.
i
find
the
arguments
for
a
new
translation
indefencible.three
stars
is
not
a
review
of
the
book
but
of
the
translation
.
this
title
is
beyond
excellent
but
you
might
do
yourself
a
favor
and
find
a
used
copy
with
the
woods
translation
there
are
many
copies
out
there
.

i
was
excited
that
a
new

of
this
lovely
book
was
out
...
until
i
read
it

this
translation
has
eliminated
most
of
the
poetry

that
made

translation
of

book
a
classic
in

this
includes
a
translator
's
note
that
sounds
exceedingly
pompous
once
you
have
read
this
new
translation
.
i
would
not
stock
this
book

give

harcourt
by
eric
schaper
on
november
13
2002format
paperback
first
of
all
this
is
my
favorite
book
ever
and
gets
five
stars
.
when
i
'm
very
sad
or
going
through
a
difficult
time
reading
this
little
book
always
cheers
me
up
and
makes
me
feel
happy
.
it
makes
the
world
seem
right
again
and
makes
me
see
with
my
heart
.
and
it
makes
me
cry
in
that
very
good
way
we
all
those
who
cherish
this
book
love
so
much.however
the
new
translation
is
simply
dreadful
and
gets
one
star
.
it
somehow
manages
with
a
few
exceptions
to
miss
the
charm
of
the
original
at
every
step
.
the
original
english
translation
by
katherine
woods
is
a
classic
and
harcourt
's
attempt
to
``
improve
''
it
seems
ill-informed
and
gratuitous
to
me
.
i
see
from
a
number
of
other
reviews
that
i
'm
not
the
only
one
who
feels
this
way
so
i
hope
that
harcourt
comes
to
their
senses
and
goes
back
to
the
original
before
it
's
too
late
.
i
'd
hate
to
think
that
future
generations
will
know
this
book
only
by
its
new
translation
and
will
never
know
how
exquisite
it
was
before
that.if
you
've
never
read
this
book
or
are
going
to
buy
a
copy
please
get
an
old
one
woods
translation
so
as
to
maximize
your
enjoyment
while
at
the
same
time
foiling
harcourt
's
dastardly
plot
to
destroy
a
classic
.

i
love
this

what
a
beautiful
way
to
understand
that
adults
make
too
much
of
life

material
things
.
i

more
wisdom
than
a
visit
from
solomon
this
book
is
wise
.
it
may
be
a
children

book
but
it
's
packed
full
of
what
all
adults
need
to
learn
or
remember
what
they
