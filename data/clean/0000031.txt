the

concerns
a
group
of
ten
previously
unacquainted
people
who
are
lured
via
various
pretexts
to
indian
island
a
resort
home
off
the
coast
of
devon
--
and
are
promptly
accused
by
their
unseen
host
of
having
escaped
punishment
for
past
crimes
.
cut
off
from
the
world
and
fighting
rising
panic
they
scramble
to
unmask
the
killer
even
as
their
number
is
reduced
in
macabre
accordance
with
the
``
ten
little
indians
''
nursey
rhyme
displayed
in
rooms
throughout
the
house.agatha
christie
was
already
famous
when
and
then
there
were
none
also
known
under
the
title
ten
little
indians
was
published
--
but
this
book
put
her
career
well
over
the
top
nothing
like
it
had
seen
before
it
proved
a
sensation
and
writers
and
film-makers
continue
to
use
christie
's
basic
idea
to
this
very
day
.
some
critics
argue
the
novel
is
mechanical
rather
than
organic
but
i
say
if
this
is
mechanical
let
's
have
more
of
it
it
is
truly
a
can't-put-it-down
non-stop
read
a
spectacular
turn
by
the
genre
's
single
most
celebrated
author.the
success
of
the
novel
inspired
christie
to
adapt
it
for
the
stage
where
it
was
a
tremendous
success
and
there
have
been
several
film
versions
most
notably
the
1940s
rene
clair-directed
and
then
there
were
none
over
the
years
.
if
you
know
the
story
only
from
stage
and
film
versions
however
you
are
in
for
a
surprise
.
christie
felt
the
novel
's
conclusion
did
not
translate
well
to
the
stage
so
she
re-wrote
it
--
and
most
film
versions
follow
the
stage
script
not
the
novel
.
but
whether
you
've
seen
the
play
and
films
or
not
get
ready
for
a
shock

who
would
have
thought
by
michael

on

mass
market
paperback
as
i
sat
down
to
read
this
book
the
afternoon
i
received
it
in
the
mail
many
questions
passed
through
my
mind
.
i
had
never
read
any
of
agatha
christie
's
mystery
novels
and
i
wondered
would
i
like
this
one
looking
down
at
the
first
page
somehow
i
knew
that
i
would.the
first
chapter
sets
the
stage
for
the
wonderful
story
to
come
and
every
puzzle
piece
is
set
there
for
the
finale.the
book
is
brilliantly
written
and
masterly
crafted
by
agatha
christie
.
now
do
not
sit
down
exspecting
to
solve
this
one
because
that
feat
seems
entirely
impossible
.
i
do
n't
believe
she
gives
enough
clues
for
that
to
be
done
however
i
guess
there
might
be
someone
who
figured
it
out.this
novel
was
so
good
i
could
literally
not
put
it
down
.
i
finished
it
in
about
4
hours
and
was
very
pleased
at
the
end
of
the
day.i
highly
recommend
this
book
even
if
you
are
not
a
fan
of
the
mystery
genre
because
the
book
itself
is
a
literary
classic.i
am
pleased
i
decided
to
read
this
book
because
now
i
know
i
like
agatha
christie
and
will
read
more
of
her
books
and
i
hope
you
do
too

mass
market
paperback
dame
agatha
makes
a
jarring
departure
in
this
grim
and
intricate
tale
.
there
is
no
sleuth
the
pace
is
fast
frenzied
and
breathless
and
rather
than
``
types
''
she
takes
pains
with
characterizations
.
the
body
count
is
high
and
the
mode
of
death
frequently
untidy
.
``
and
then
there
were
none
''
is
among
the
most
favored
of
christie
's
books
.
it
has
gone
through
a
few
title
changes
i
knew
it
as
``
ten
little
indians
''
and
before
that
it
had
even
a
more
politically
incorrect
title
.
be
forewarned
ms.
christie
is
neither
enlightened
nor
tolerant
.
some
of
the
passages
and
references
are
bigoted
and
might
offend
some
readers.a
group
of
ten
strangers
is
invited
or
hired
for
a
long
weekend
on
indian
island
a
mile
off
the
devon
coast
.
it
is
somewhat
improbable
that
these
ten
would
all
accept
such
a
vague
invitation
from
a
host
they
do
not
know
to
a
place
they
have
never
seen
before
but
each
for
his
or
her
own
reasons
accepts
.
they
include
a
doctor
a
games
mistress
a
soldier
of
fortune
a
rich
playboy
a
retired
policeman
a
judge
a
spinster
a
retired
general
and
a
married
couple
who
are
to
be
the
servants
.
they
arrive
on
a
bleak
rocky
island
to
a
completely
modern
house
with
all
the
amenities
.
the
fires
are
welcoming
there
is
an
ample
supply
of
food
the
servants
are
impeccable
but
their
host
is
absent
.
in
each
of
the
bedrooms
the
ten
little
indians
nursery
rhyme
is
posted
on
a
prominent
wall
.
it
begins
''
ten
little
indian
boys
went
out
to
dineone
choked
his
little
self
and
then
there
were
nine.
--
-drinks
are
served
and
one
guest
chokes
turns
blue
and
falls
over
dead
.
the
tension
builds
the
fright
of
the
stranded
people
is
palpable
as
one
by
one
they
are
picked
off
each
in
accordance
with
the
nursery
rhyme.read

review
helpfulperhaps
one
of
the
greatest
mysteries
ever
written
by
a
customer
on
march
4
1999format
mass
market
paperback
set
on
an
isolated
island
without
contact
of
the
outside
civilization
agatha
christie
's
novel
and
then
there
were
none
is
the
story
of
tem
strangers
invited
to
an
island
by
a
mysterious
host.the
book
starts
out
with
an
introduction
to
the
ten
characters
.
although
this
is
effective
in
telling
the
characters
it
is
also
boring
and
does
not
catch
your
attention
right
away
.
but
as
soon
as
the
guests
arrive
on
indian
island
this
boredom
disperses
and
an
exciting
thriller
breaks
through
.
what
is
also
exciting
about
this
novel
is
you
have
no
idea
who
is
committing
these
strange
murders.the
first
night
these
people
are
at
the
house
they
are
greeted
with
an
eerie
voice
that
accuses
them
of
murders
that
were
committed
but
were
never
convicted
of
in
the
past
.
when
the
guests
arrive
there
is
no
trace
of
u.n.
owen
but
as
the
guests
start
to
die
this
mysterious
figure
reveals
his
ugly
face.this
book
shows
fear
in
peoples
conciences
the
guilt
that
lies
within
and
the
hate
among
strangers
.
anyone
who
wants
to
read
a
suspenseful
murder
mystery
and
wamts
to
stay
on
the
end
of
their
seats
should
read
this
wicked
novel
of
horror
and
fear

undoubtedly
one
of
the
best
stories
by
agatha

.
i
was
so
curious
to
see
how
the
killings
can
be
close
to
the
poem
and
she
left
a
good
little
vent
for
realistic-ness
