the

are
impressive

not

imaginative
and
the

for
marvel
's
the
avengers
½
after
five
movies
of
build-up
four
of
marvel
's
superheros
finally
assemble
in
this
mega-blockbuster
extravaganza
.
this
movie
is
simply
awesome
and
kick-ass
in
every
aspect
from
the
story
characters
acting
humor
and
visual
effects-driven
spectacle
.
the
final
battle
between
the
avengers
and
loki
's
army
in
the
middle
of
a
downtown
area
is
summer
blockbuster
action
at
it
's
very
best
.
every
member
of
the
avengers
from
iron
man
to
even
hawkeye
get
their
times
to
shine
in
both
the
action
sequences
and
character
development
.
however
the
true
heart
of
the
film
is
the
joys
of
seeing
larger-than-life
figures
interacting
with
each
other
.
the
film
focuses
on
each
of
the
superheros
along
with
members
of
shield
learning
to
work
together
in
order
to
take
down
a
common
enemy
and
these
scenes
are
just
as
compelling
as
the
action
sequences
thanks
to
director
joss
whedon
's
signature
witty
dialogue
and
total
respect
for
each
individual
character
.
each
member
of
the
cast
brings
their
a-game
to
their
respective
roles
.
one
cast
member
that
deserves
special
mention
is
mark
ruffalo
who
proves
to
be
a
great
bruce
banner
.
his
interpretation
of
banner
is
different
from
edward
norton
but
just
as
compelling
.
another
thing
that
deserves
mention
is
how
whedon
seamlessly
nails
the
look
of
a
comic
book
without
looking
cheesy
or
over-stylized
which
is
probably
the
first
time
i
saw
that
done
successfully
in
a
comic
book
superhero
movie
.
there
are
so
many
things
that
could
have
went
wrong
with
this
superhero
all-star
concept
and
whedon
pull
it
off
with
such
slickness
that
he
makes
it
look
easy
.
not
only
is
``
the
avengers
''
incredibly
smart
and
fun
but
it
also
manages
to
be
not
only
the
best
marvel
movie
but
one
of
the
greatest
superhero
movies
of
all
time
.

's
mightiest
heroes
to
form
a
response
team
when
asgardian
demi-god
loki
returns
to
spearhead
an
alien
invasion
.
joss
whedon
is
finally
given
a
chance
to
prove
what
he
can
do
with
the
appropriate
resources
to
hand
and
in
avengers
assemble
has
created
a
rip-roaring
rollercoaster
of
escapist
entertainment
that
has
all
the
ingredients
of
a
first
class
summer
blockbuster
.
dispensing
with
his
usual
formula
of
wise
cracks
and
pop
culture
references
it
begins
as
a
fairly
generic
action
fantasy
but
as
the
heroes
are
introduced
his
skill
for
creating
likeable
characters
and
entertaining
comic
dialogue
is
framed
within
a
plot
which
wo
n't
win
any
awards
for
originality
but
contains
just
the
right
balance
of
characterisation
comedy
and
eye
boggling
set
pieces
.
once
again
it
is
robert
downey
jr.
who
is
the
star
of
the
show
but
the
cast
of
supporting
characters
make
for
an
ensemble
team
that
play
off
each
other
extremely
well
and
each
have
just
enough
room
to
strut
their
stuff
without
overshadowing
or
clashing
with
each
other
.
i
've
always
preferred
the
x-men
comics
as
i
've
always
found
the
avengers
a
little
too
establishment-orientated
and
a
bit
of
a
dumping
ground
for
characters
not
interesting
enough
to
have
books
of
their
own
but
whedon
's
decision
to
make
their
first
encounter
a
squabbling
pissing
contest
works
really
well
and
the
alien
invasion
is
as
thrilling
as
it
is
visually
spectacular
.
far
far
better
than
thor
and
the
hulk
films
and
even
better
than
iron
man
avengers
assembles
fulfils
all
the
promise
of
the
idea
and
although
still
not
the
match
of
