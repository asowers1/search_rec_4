protecting

nolan
has
stated

eight-year

of

those
of

10
bale
employed
a
mixed-martial-arts
discipline
called
the
keysi
fighting
method
but
due
to
bruce
's
current
state
and
bane
's
style
the
method
had
to
be
modified.11
bale
has
stated
that
the
dark
knight
rises
will
be
the
final
film
in
which
he
plays
batman.12
he
describes
the
character
's
arc
as
finally
confronting
the
pain
of
loss
that
he
has
deferred
for
years
by
fighting
criminals
balanced
against
the
need
to
internalize
that
pain
lest
he
give
into
his
emotions
and
become
the
killer
the
city
already
believes
him
to
be
.
bale
also
acknowledged
that
batman
is
not
a
flawless
individual
that
``
he
's
not
a
healthy
individual
this
is
somebody
that
is
doing
good
but
he
's
right
on
the
verge
of
doing
bad
.
he
's
got
that
killer
within
him
that
he
's
desperately
trying
to
not
let
off
his
leash
.
and
that
's
what
i
always
return
to
.
``
13
bale
clarifies
that
``
he
does
n't
want
to
forget
his
parents
'
deaths
.
he
wants
to
maintain
that
anger
he
felt
at
that
injustice
.
but
equally
he
wants
to
present
this
very
vacuous
soulless
persona
to
gotham
so
that
hopefully
no-one
will
suspect
him
but
will
just
think
he
's
a
spoiled
bastard
.
``
14
bale
felt
bittersweet
about
leaving
the
franchise
saying
that
it
was
like
``
saying
goodbye
to
an
old
friend

originally
a
member
of
the
league

before
being
excommunicated

the
character
was
chosen
by
christopher

because
of
his
desire
to
see

tested
on
both
a
physical
and
mental
level.1025

nolan
wanted
the
story
for

to
keep
him
emotionally
invested
.
``
on
a
more
superficial
level
i
have
to

''
he
reasoned
``
how

60
nolan
said
that
he
never
even
thought
a
third
film
was
possible
in
the
foreword
for
his
book
the
art
and
making
of
the
dark

nolan
only
agreed
to
a
third

on
the
basis
of
finding
a
worthwhile
story
fearing
that
he
would
become
bored
halfway
through

if
he
discovered
the
film
to
be
unnecessary.62
by

nolan
completed
a
rough
story
outline
before
he
committed
himself
to

later
in

alan

confirmed
that
while

about

were
ongoing
no
casting
had
been
done
and
horn
denied
all
such

before
nolan
confirmed
his

gary

had
said
he
was
confident
nolan
would
return.65
following
the
success
of
the
joker
in
the
dark

studio
executives
wished
for
the
riddler
to
be
included
as
the
primary
villain
as
he
was
considered
a
similar
character
and
encouraged
the
casting
of
leonardo
dicaprio.66
however
nolan
wanted
the
antagonist
to
be
vastly
different
from
the
previous
incarnations
and
committed
to
using
bane
instead66
citing
the
need
for
a
character
with
a
physical
presence
within
the
film.67
he
was
initially
unfamiliar
with
the
character
's
back-story25
but
pointed
out
the
appeal
of
an
archetype
labelling
it
as
``
the
extreme
of
some
type
of
villainy
''
.
when
comparing
the
choice
of
bane
with
the
joker
nolan
highlighted
the
joker
as
an
example
of
``
diabolical
chaotic
anarchy
and
has
a
devilish
sense
of
humor
''
juxtaposing
him
against
bane
who
he
likened
to
``
a
classic

monster

with
a
terrific
brain

67
it
was
not
until

said
that

which
had
been
shot
on

and
edited
from
the

negative
.
nolan
feeling
that
the
use
of
film
stock
in
cinema
is
currently
being
phased
out
due
to
the
introduction
of
digital
cinematography
and
projection
used
this
screening
to
make
a
case
for
the
continued
use
of
film
which
he
asserts
still
offers
superior
image
quality
to
any
digital
format
and
warned
the
filmmakers
that
unless
they
continued
to
assert
their
choice
to
use
film
in
their
productions
they
may
eventually
lose
it
as
an
option.110111
nolan
explained
``
i
wanted
to
give
them
a
chance
to
see
the
potential
because
i
think
imax
is
the
best
film
format
that
was
ever
invented
.
it
's
the
gold
standard
and
what
any
other
technology
has
to
match
up
to
but
none
have
in
my
opinion
.
the
message
i
wanted
to
put
out
there
was
that
no
one
is
taking
anyone
's
digital
cameras
away
.
but
if
we
want
film
to
continue
as
an
option
and
someone
is
working
on
a
big
studio
movie
with
the
resources
and
the
power
to
insist
on
film
they
should
say
so
.
i
felt
as
if
i
did
n't
say
anything
and
then
we
started
to
lose
that
option
it
would
be
a
shame
.
when
i
look
at
a
digitally
acquired
and
projected
image
it
looks
inferior
against
an
original
negative
anamorphic

an

one

it

the

was
difficult
as

in

who
could
work
with

the

layer
was
made
of
a
polyester
mesh
that
is
utilized
by

military

high-tech

manufacturers
because
of
its
breathability
and
moisture-wicking

one

producer
emma
thomas
stated
this
batman
film
has
a
different
visual
aesthetic
from
the
first
two
nolan-directed
features
explaining
that
``
it
's
meant
to
be
winter

the
film
introduces
a
vehicle
that
has
been
compared
with
the
batplane
and
the
batcopter
dubbed
``
the
bat
''
.
in
designing
the
bat
nathan
crowley
approached
it
as
if
it
were
an
actual
military
project
emphasising
the
need
for
it
to
``
fit
into
the
same
family
''
as
the
tumbler
and
the
batpod
.
the
final
version
of
the
bat
takes
its
design
cues
from
the
harrier
jump
jet
bell
boeing
v-22
osprey
and
the
boeing
ah-64
apache.11
chris
corbould
described
the
bat
's
size
and
shape
as
presenting
a
major
challenge
for
filming
given
christopher
nolan
's
emphasis
on
practical
effects
over
computer-generated
imagery
.
in
order
to
make
the
bat
``
fly
''
it
was
variously
supported
by
wires
suspended
from
cranes
and
helicopters
and
mounted
on
a
purpose-built
vehicle
with
hydraulic
controls
to
simulate
movement.11117118
when
designing
the
batcave

crowley
and
fellow
production
designer
kevin
kavanaugh
hit
upon
the
idea
of
flooding
the
batcave
and
having
batman
's
equipment
the
batsuit
and
a
supercomputer
rise
from
the
water.11
another
set
was
designed
at
cardington
as

catherine

of

british

the

claimed
the

``

capitalist

212
in

liberal

opined
in

that
``
what
passes
for
a
right-wing

reported
that

``
foreseen

the

has
denied
the

criticizes
the

insists
that
none
of
his
batman

are
intended
to
be
political

we
put

in

that

simply
a
backdrop

what
we
're
really
trying
to
do
is
show
the
cracks

the
conflicts
that
somebody
would
try

wedge
open
.
we
're
going
to
get
wildly
different
interpretations
of
what
the

is
supporting

not
supporting

it
's
not
doing
any

it

alternatively
politically-conservative
commentator
rush

alleged
that
the

was
biased
against

to
