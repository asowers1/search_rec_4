christopher
nolan
has
outdone
himself
with
this
one
.
at
3.30
in
the
morning
i
was
tired
.
just
getting
out
of
it
i
've
never
been
so
awake
.
perhaps
what
set
this
film
apart
from
his
other
films
was
that
it
had
a
genuine
emotional
heartbeat
.
i
felt
that
this
was
a
flaw
of
nolan
's
other
films
-
the
vision
of
emotion
was
there
but
it
was
hollow
.
in
this
i
bought
it
.
i
felt
it
hero
and
villain
alike.christian
bale
was
typically
brilliant
as
batman
and
i
felt
that
bruce
wayne
was
more
heavily
embraced
in
this
final
installment
.
bale
added
emotional
depth
to
the
character
-
a
plot
point
that
i
think
went
astray
in
the
dark
knight
-
picking
up
from
the
development
made
in
batman
begins.tom
hardy
as
bane
was
quite
simply
terrifying
.
no
longer
a
dunderhead
``
enforcer
''
but
one
of
the
criminal
masterminds
behind
``
gotham
's
reckoning
''
coupled
with
a
physical
dominance
strong
enough
to
send
shivers
down
your
spine.anne
hathaway
as
selina
kyle
defied
my
expectations
.
hands
up
who
was
not
entirely
convinced
that
that
girl
from
the
princess
diaries
could
handle
an
intensely
physical
role
like
catwoman
.
but
here
i
am
hugely
impressed
.
she
added
immeasurably
to
the
value
of
the
film.marion
cotillard
fulfilled
the
role
of
miranda
tate
admirably
though
i
suspect
this
was
the
most
underdeveloped
character
of
the
film
-
though
after
watching
i
can
see
why.the
unsung
hero
of
the
dark
knight
rises
is
michael
caine
as
alfred
.
a
heartfelt
performance
that
helps
drive
the
emotional
content
of
the
film
helping
nolan
sell
his
most
well-rounded
film
to
date
.
caine
's
performance
in
both
presence
and
absence.special
mention
goes
to
joseph
gordon
levitt
who
is
consistently
proving
himself
to
be
a
big
player
in
the
hollywood
game
.
his
role
as
officer
blake
felt
like
there
could
've
been
more
but
it
may
just
have
come
all
a
bit
much
.
it
was
a
great
performance
and
levitt
sunk
his
teeth
into
role
.
if
you
can
go
see
this
in
imax
.
if
any
film
was
to
sell
the
format
to
skeptics
the
dark
knight
rises
would
be
it
.
i
'm
happy
nolan
stuck
to
his
guns
and
shot
in
2d
.
3d
would
have
been
unnecessary
.
i
suppose
at
this
point
i
have
to
turn
my
focus
on
nolan
.
if
he
ever
reads
this
...
aspiring
filmmaker
to
filmmaker
i
've
never
been
so
envious
jealous
in
all
my
life
.
it
's
a
film
that
leaves
me
floundering
wondering
what
i
could
possibly
do
to
get
anywhere
near
this
ballpark
.
well
done
.
i
think
an
oscar
nomination
is
in
order.from
here
i
'm
not
sure
what
to
expect
of
the
future
.
does
our
imagination
carry
us
forward
or
do
the
studios
