some

united

see
all
my
reviews
it
is
still
worth
the
high
price
of
the
3-d
admission
to
see
some
of
the
amazing
animation
and
design
but
the
writing
is
extremely
boring
and
clumsy
and
the
performances
can
not
save
it
.
too
many
liberties
were
taken
with
the
originals
here
and
in
no
way
improve
upon
them
it
only
barely
resembles
either
of
carroll
's
books
in
theme
and
some
specific
scenes
.
there
are
some
``
disney
moments
''
that
literally
set
off
a
gag
reflex
as
well.the
animation
is
quite
stunning
and
wonderful
though
as
is
the
costuming
and
set
design
in
so
much
as
there
were
sets
and
not
just
green
screens
i
'm
sure
some
actual
props
were
used
.
there
are
some
clever
elements
that
owe
only
to
good
visual
design
and
direction
i
'm
sure
as
the
only
other
clever
bits
in
the
dialogue
were
the
parts
directly
lifted
from
the
originals
.
