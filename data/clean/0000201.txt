the
biggest
surprise
may
just
be
how
satisfying
nolan
has
made
his
farewell
to
a
dark
knight
trilogy
that
many
fans
will
wish
he
'd
extend
to
a
10-part
series
at
least
.

the
director
and
cowriterbrother
jonathan
nolan
pay
heed
to
wayne
's
wounded
emotional
arc
.
and
the
film
is
a
feat
of
painstakingly
crafted
closure
.

have
been
a
swifter

's
earned
it
