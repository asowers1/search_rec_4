the
da
vinci
code
by
dan
brown
is
one
of
the
most
intriguing
yet
disturbing
books
to
ever
hit
bestseller
lists
.
it
has
entertained
millions
of
fiction
fans
and
will
probably
continue
to
do
so
thanks
to
director
ron
howard
's
motion
picture
adaptation
of
it
starring
tom
hanks
.
unfortunately
the
saga
boldly
attacks
christian
beliefs
relating
to
the
reliability
of
scripture
the
deity
of
christ
the
organization
of
the
early
church
and
the
activities
of
church
leaders
during
christianity
's
formative
years
.
it
basically
condemns
the
entire
faith
as
nothing
less
than
a
wicked
fraud
.
as
one
book
reviewer
put
it
the
da
vinci
code
promotes
``
the
gleefully
heretical
notion
that
the
entirety
of
judeo-christian
culture
is
founded
on
a
misogynist
woman-hating
lie
.
''
or
as
the
novel
itself
reads
``
almost
everything
our
fathers
taught
us
about
christ
is
false
''
p.
235
.
according
to
the
da
vinci
code
true
christianity
was
started
by
a
jesus
christ
whom
others
viewed
as
just
another
prophet
.
he
allegedly
made
no
claims
of
divinity
.
moreover
he
was
married
and
his
wife
was
none
other
than
mary
magdalene
who
not
only
bore
his
child
but
who
also
was
handpicked
by
him
to
lead
the
church
.
this
plan
however
fell
through
after
christ
's
death
because
the
other
apostles
especially
peter
were
enraged
about
mary
being
christ
's
successor
.
so
she
fled
in
fear
of
her
life
to
france
where
she
raised
christ
's
daughter
.
there
so
the
story
goes
christ
's
lineage
intermarried
with
french
royalty
thereby
creating
the
merovingian
bloodline
of
kings
.
virtually
everyone
knew
this
``
truth
''
during
christianity
's
earliest
years
says
brown
's
book
.
but
then
by
recasting
mary
``
as
a
whore
in
order
to
erase
evidence
of
her
powerful
family
ties
''
male
church
leaders
were
able
to
begin
``
the
greatest
cover-up
in
human
history
.
''
these
religious
villains
also
changed
the
originally
pagan
goddess-worshiping
church
into
a
jesus-worshiping
power-crazed
den
of
evildoers
who
perverted
christ
's
teachings
to
further
their
own
political
agenda
.
in
the
da
vinci
code
we
also
learn
that
mary
magdalene
's
story
would
have
been
lost
forever
had
it
not
been
for
her
protectors
.
they
chronicled
mary
's
life
and
even
catalogued
her
descendants
.
nevertheless
the
church
relentlessly
sought
to
annihilate
all
documents
relating
to
her
identity
and
``
her
family
's
rightful
claim
to
power
.
''
this
ongoing
attempt
by
roman
catholic
authorities
to
eradicate
all
evidence
of
``
the
true
story
of
her
life
''
went
on
for
centuries
.
the
church
's
diabolical
plot
failed
however
because
a
group
of
truth-honoring
knights
stepped
into
the
conflict
.
these
warriors
``
known
collectively
as
the
knights
templar
''
were
organized
by
a
brotherhood
called
the
priory
of
sion
a
secret
group
allegedly
founded
in
1099
by
the
french
king
godefroi
de
bouillon
.
he
was
a
descendant
of
jesus
and
mary
who
according
to
the
da
vinci
code
formed
the
priory
so
the
truth
would
be
protected
and
passed
on
to
future
generations
.
who
were
the
members
of
the
priory
of
sion
this
is
where
leonardo
da
vinci
comes
into
the
picture
.
he
and
sir
isaac
newton
along
with
the
italian
painter
botticelli
the
french
author
victor
hugo
and
many
other
historical
figures
were
all
supposedly
grand
masters
of
the
priory
.
for
proof
of
leonardo
's
involvement
brown
says
that
one
need
only
look
at
some
of
the
artist
's
most
famous
paintings
.
they
supposedly
contain
symbols
and
codes
that
reflect
leonardo
's
own
worship
of
the
sacred
feminine
or
the
goddess
his
disdain
for
traditional
christianity
and
the
truth
about
mary
magdalene
.
it
is
difficult
to
know
where
to
begin
dissecting
the
da
vinci
code
.
brown
's
story
is
little
more
than
a
well-
crafted
cleverly
written
454-page
diatribe
against
christianity
especially
its
roman
catholic
sector
.
equally
troubling
is
the
way
that
he
his
publisher
and
the
media
have
presented
the
da
vinci
code
as
a
``
fact-based
''
expose
wherein
the
characters
reveal
truths
long
hidden
from
or
at
the
very
least
ignored
by
the
general
public
.
to
use
the
author
's
own
words
``
when
you
finish
the
book
like
it
or
not
you
've
learned
a
ton
.
''
nearly
every
reviewer
has
parroted
this
line
which
is
not
surprising
since
the
book
itself
on
the
very
first
page
reads
``
fact
...
all
descriptions
of
artwork
architecture
documents
and
secret
rituals
in
this
novel
are
accurate
.
''
the
truth
however
is
that
brown
's
story
has
very
little
to
do
with
truth
.
instead
errors
abound
in
the
da
vinci
code
and
not
just
about
christianity
either
but
also
about
the
knights
templar
medieval
witch
hunts
pagan
symbolism
the
dead
sea
scrolls
the
gnostic
gospels
and
the
works
of
leonardo
da
vinci
.
brown
does
not
even
get
right
the
number
of
glass
panes
in
the
louvre
museum
's
pyramid
there
were
673
panes
not
666
or
the
origins
of
the
olympic
games
in
ancient
greece
he
claims
they
were
based
on
an
eight-year
cycle
in
honor
of
venus
when
in
reality
they
ran
on
a
four-year
cycle
in
honor
of
zeus
.
such
mistakes
illustrate
the
book
's
main
weakness
its
lack
of
accuracy
and
misrepresentations
of
history
.
in
other
words
beyond
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
christianity
is
true
readers
must
also
ask
themselves
several
questions
that
are
far
more
basic
to
the
story
does
it
correctly
present
historical
events
does
it
properly
interpret
classic
works
of
art
does
it
accurately
represent
christian
teachings
ultimately
the
facts
will
speak
for
themselves
.
