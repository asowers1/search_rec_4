events
summary
inside
the
wardrobe
because
of
the
dangers
of
world
war
ii
the
four
pevensie
children
were
sent
away
from
london
to
the
home
of
professor
digory
kirke
who
lived
in
a
large
old
house
with
many
rooms
useful
for
hiding
and
exploration
.
while
exploring
the
house
with
her
siblings
lucy
decided
to
investigate
an
old
wardrobe
she
found
in
one
of
the
remote
rooms
.
upon
entering
the
wardrobe
lucy
found
herself
walking
through
trees
rather
than
the
expected
coats
.
she
pressed
on
and
found
herself
standing
in
the
middle
of
a
snowy
wood
next
to
a
lamp-post
where
she
met
tumnus
the
faun
who
invited
her
to
his
home
for
tea
.
he
later
told
her
that
he
had
intended
to
hand
her
over
to
the
white
witch
the
usurping
queen
of
narnia
.
the
faun
feeling
guilty
for
what
he
had
planned
to
do
helped
lucy
find
her
way
back
to
the
wardrobe
despite
the
risk
that
the
white
witch
would
find
him
out
and
punish
him
.
later
lucy
tried
to
tell
her
siblings
about
the
strange
land
she
had
found
but
they
did
not
believe
her
.
during
a
game
of
hide-and-seek
lucy
returned
to
the
country
in
the
wardrobe
and
edmund
followed
her
so
he
could
go
on
teasing
her
about
her
``
imaginary
''
country
.
although
he
denied
it
when
the
older
children
asked
him
soon
all
four
of
them
had
gone
into
the
wardrobe
and
seen
narnia
.
susan
the
most
sensible
of
them
wanted
to
return
home
but
lucy
convinced
peter
that
they
needed
to
help
her
new
friend
mr.
tumnus
who
was
arrested
.
the
prophecy
''
...
down
at
cair
paravel
there
are
four
thrones
and
it
's
a
saying
in
narnia
time
out
of
mind
that
when
two
sons
of
adam
and
two
daughters
of
eve
sit
on
those
four
thrones
then
it
will
be
the
end
only
of
the
white
witch
's
reign
but
of
her
life
...
''
mr.
beaversrc
the
four
children
were
soon
found
by
mr.
beaver
who
took
them
home
introduced
them
to
his
wife
mrs.
beaver
and
they
had
dinner
.
he
told
them
of
aslan
the
great
lion
and
a
prophecy
that
said
when
two
sons
of
adam
and
two
daughters
of
eve
sat
upon
the
four
thrones
at
cair
paravel
all
narnia
would
be
put
to
rights
.
while
they
were
talking
they
found
out
that
edmund
had
slipped
away
and
they
decided
to
flee
after
realizing
that
he
would
tell
where
they
were
to
the
white
witch
.
on
their
journey
they
met
father
christmas
who
gave
lucy
a
cordial
made
from
the
juice
of
fireflowers
that
would
heal
others
with
a
single
drop
and
a
dagger
and
gave
susan
bow
and
arrows
and
a
horn
which
could
bring
help
whenever
it
was
blown
and
peter
a
sword
and
a
shield
.
``
come
out
mrs
beaver
.
come
out
sons
and
daughters
of
adam
.
it
's
all
right
it
is
n't
her
''
mr.
beaversrc
''
this
was
bad
grammar
of
course
but
that
is
how
beavers
talk
when
they
are
excited
i
mean
in
narnia
-
in
our
world
they
usually
do
n't
talk
at
all
''
c.s
lewissrc
later
after
they
arrived
at
aslan
's
camp
while
susan
and
lucy
were
having
fun
near
the
woods
two
wolves
attacked
them
.
susan
called
for
help
with
her
horn
and
peter
and
aslan
came
to
their
rescue
.
peter
killed
maugrim
one
of
the
wolves
in
his
first
fight
and
aslan
let
the
other
wolf
go
followed
by
centaurs
and
eagles
from
aslan
's
army
.
that
wolf
led
them
right
to
edmund
whom
they
rescued
.
later
the
witch
requested
an
audience
with
aslan
.
there
she
claimed
that
since
edmund
was
a
traitor
according
to
the
deep
magic
his
blood
belonged
to
her
.
eventually
she
and
aslan
went
inside
the
tent
where
they
reached
an
agreement
that
she
would
kill
him
later
that
night
but
renounce
her
claim
on
edmund
.
aslan
eventually
went
though
without
telling
anyone
.
however
lucy
and
susan
saw
him
leaving
and
followed
.
there
they
saw
aslan
being
killed
after
which
the
witch
's
army
left
.
in
the
morning
just
as
they
were
about
to
leave
they
heard
the
stone
table
crack
.
when
they
turned
around
to
look
they
saw
aslan
standing
before
them
who
revealed
to
them
the
deeper
magic
from
before
the
dawn
of
time
stated
that
when
``
a
willing
victim
is
killed
in
a
traitor
's
stead
the
table
would
crack
and
even
death
would
start
working
backwards
.
''
afterwards
they
went
to
the
witch
's
castle
and
revived
all
the
statues
.
lucy
found
mr.
tumnus
begged
aslan
to
revive
him
and
soon
afterward
she
and
the
revived
faun
were
dancing
happily
.
they
then
joined
the
battle
between
aslan
's
army
and
the
witch
's
which
had
started
earlier
that
morning
.
when
it
was
all
over
after
aslan
had
killed
the
witch
the
children
were
crowned
high
king
peter
the
magnificent
queen
susan
the
gentle
king
edmund
the
just
and
queen
lucy
the
valiant
.
back
to
london
the
four
of
them
ruled
over
narnia
for
many
years
and
grew
into
adults
.
the
land
prospered
under
them
and
the
time
of
their
rule
became
known
as
the
golden
age
of
narnia
.
but
one
day
as
they
were
hunting
a
white
stag
in
the
woods
they
came
across
a
lamppost
and
soon
they
were
tumbling
back
out
of
the
wardrobe
in
the
back
room
of
the
professor
's
house

a

lewis
sent

the

with
a
letter
.
in

when
the

was
published
this
letter
became
its
dedication
-
my
dear
lucy
i
wrote
this
story
for
you
but
when
i
began
it
i
had
not
realized
that
girls
grow
quicker
than
books
.
as
a
result
you
are
already
too
old
for
fairy
tales
and
by
the
time
it
is
printed
and
bound
you
will
be
older
still
.
but
some
day
you
will
be
old
enough
to
start
reading
fairy
tales
again
.
you
can
then
take
it
down
from
some
upper
shelf
dust
it
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
it
.
i
shall
probably
be
too
deaf
to
hear
and
too
old
to
understand
a
word
you
say
but
i
shall
still
be
your
affectionate
godfather
