on
a
golden
summer
day
at
the
bank
of
a
tranquil
river
in
the
year
1862
a
young
girl
named
alice
grows
bored
listening
to
her
older
sister
read
aloud
from
a
history
book
of
william
i
of
england
.
when
her
sister
chastises
alice
's
daydreaming
alice
tells
her
kitten
dinah
that
she
can
live
in
a
nonsensical
magical
land
called
wonderland
.
while
daydreaming
alice
spots
a
waistcoat-wearing
white
rabbit
passing
by
exclaiming
that
he
is
``
late
for
an
important
date
''
.
alice
gives
chase
and
follows
him
into
a
rabbit
hole
and
falls
into
a
large
furnished
chasm
.
her
dress
catches
her
fall
like
a
parachute
and
she
floats
gently
down
.
she
sees
the
white
rabbit
disappear
into
a
tiny
door
and
tries
to
follow
but
the
door
's
talking
knob
advises
her
to
alter
her
size
using
a
mysterious
bottle
marked
``
drink
me
.
''
the
contents
shrink
her
to
a
fraction
of
her
normal
size
but
the
door
is
locked
and
the
key
is
out
of
reach
.
she
then
takes
a
bite
of
a
cookie
that
says
âeat
meâ
and
grows
large
enough
to
fill
the
entire
room
.
she
begins
to
weep
large
tears
that
flood
the
room
.
the
doorknob
then
tells
alice
to
drink
from
the
bottle
again
which
causes
her
to
shrink
once
more
.
alice
falls
into
the
bottle
and
passes
through
the
door
's
keyhole
and
into
wonderland
.
she
meets
several
strange
characters
including
the
dodo
and
tweedledee
and
tweedledum
who
recount
the
tale
of
``
the
walrus
and
the
carpenter
''
.
alice
eventually
finds
the
white
rabbit
in
his
house
she
is
sent
to
fetch
some
gloves
after
being
mistaken
for
his
housemaid
.
she
eats
a
cookie
and
grows
into
a
giant
again
getting
stuck
in
the
rabbit
's
house
.
she
tries
to
pull
herself
out
but
is
too
big
.
the
white
rabbit
the
dodo
and
chimney
sweep
bill
the
lizard
believe
alice
to
be
a
monster
and
plot
to
burn
the
house
down
but
alice
escapes
by
eating
a
carrot
and
shrinking
down
to
the
size
of
an
insect
.
she
meets
a
garden
of
talking
flowers
who
initially
welcome
her
with
a
song
but
then
chase
her
away
when
an
iris
accuses
her
of
being
a
weed
.
alice
is
then
instructed
by
a
hookah-smoking
caterpillar
to
eat
a
part
of
his
mushroom
grow
back
to
her
original
size
.
alice
decides
to
keep
the
remaining
pieces
of
the
mushroom
on
hand
.
alice
meets
the
cheshire
cat
who
advises
her
to
visit
the
mad
hatter
march
hare
and
the
dormouse
.
the
three
are
hosting
a
mad
tea
party
and
celebrate
alice
's
``
unbirthday
''
.
the
white
rabbit
appears
but
the
mad
hatter
and
the
march
hare
destroy
his
pocketwatch
and
throw
him
out
of
the
party
.
fed
up
with
all
the
nonsense
alice
abandons
her
pursuit
of
the
white
rabbit
and
decides
to
go
home
but
gets
lost
in
the
tulgey
wood
.
fearing
she
is
lost
forever
alice
breaks
down
into
tears
.
the
cheshire
cat
appears
again
and
leads
alice
into
a
giant
hedge
maze
ruled
by
the
tyrannical
queen
of
hearts
and
her
meek
husband
the
king
of
hearts
.
the
queen
orders
the
beheading
of
anyone
who
enrages
her
and
invites
alice
to
a
bizarre
croquet
match
using
flamingoes
and
hedgehogs
as
the
equipment
.
the
cheshire
cat
appears
again
and
pulls
a
trick
on
the
queen
which
she
accuses
alice
of
doing
.
alice
is
put
on
trial
and
unfairly
judged
.
she
then
remembers
she
still
has
the
remains
of
the
caterpillar
's
mushroom
and
consumes
both
.
quickly
growing
to
a
gigantic
size
alice
feels
free
to
speak
her
mind
and
openly
insults
the
queen
.
however
she
shrinks
back
to
her
normal
size
just
as
rapidly
.
enraged
the
queen
orders
her
execution
.
alice
flees
and
becomes
pursued
by
most
of
wonderland
's
characters
until
she
finally
reunites
with
the
doorknob
.
alice
begs
to
be
let
through
the
door
.
the
doorknob
then
tells
her
she
is
having
a
dream
forcing
alice
to
wake
herself
up
just
in
time
.
now
realizing
that
logic
and
reason
exist
for
a
purpose
alice
walks
home
with
her
sister
and
dinah
for
tea

walt
disney
's
association
with
lewis
carroll
's
alice
books
alice
's
adventures
in
wonderland
and
through
the
looking-glass
stretches
all
the
way
back
to
his
childhood
.
like
many
children
of
the
time
he
was
familiar
with
the
alice
books
and
had
read
them
as
a
school
boy.3
in
1923
when
disney
was
still
a
21-year-old
filmmaker
trying
to
make
a
name
for
himself
by
working
at
the
laugh-o-gram
studio
in
kansas
city
making
the
unsuccessful
short
cartoon
series
by
the
name
of
newman
laugh-o-grams
.
the
last
of
newman
laugh-o-grams
was
called
alice
's
wonderland
which
was
loosely
inspired
by
the
alice
books
.
the
short
featured
a
live-action
girl
virginia
davis
interacting
in
an
animated
world
.
faced
with
business
problems
however
the
laugh-o-gram
studio
went
bankrupt
in
july
1923
and
the
film
was
never
released
to
the
general
public.4
however
disney
left
for
hollywood
and
used
the
film
as
a
sort
of
pilot
to
show
to
potential
distributors
.
margaret
j.
winkler
of
winkler
pictures
agreed
to
distribute
the
alice
comedies
and
disney
partnered
with
his
older
brother
roy
o.
disney
and
re-hired
kansas
city
co-workers
including
ub
iwerks
rudolph
ising
friz
freleng
carman
maxwell
and
hugh
harman
to
form
disney
bros.
studios
later
walt
disney
productions.4
the
series
began
in
1924
before
being
retired
in
1927
.
in
1932
walt
began
toying
with
the
idea
of
making
an
animated
feature
film
and
repeatedly
turned
to
the
idea
of
making
a
feature-length
animatedlive-action
version
of
alice
starring
mary
pickford
and
even
purchased
the
rights
to
sir
john
tenniel
's
illustrations
still
under
copyright
at
the
time.35
however
these
plans
were
eventually
scrapped
in
favor
of
snow
white
and
the
seven
dwarfs
mainly
because
disney
was
put
off
by
paramount
's
1933
live-action
adaptation.3
however
disney
did
not
completely
abandon
the
idea
of
adapting
alice
and
in
1936
made
the
mickey
mouse
cartoon
thru
the
mirror
.
in
1938
after
the
enormous
success
of
snow
white
walt
disney
revived
the
idea
of
making
an
alice
feature
and
officially
registered
the
title
alice
in
wonderland
with
the
motion
picture
association
of
america
and
hired
storyboard
artist
al
perkins
and
art
director
david
s.
hall
to
develop
the
story
and
concept
art
for
the
film.3
a
storyreel
was
complete
in
1939
but
walt
was
not
pleased
as
he
felt
that
hall
's
drawings
resembled
tenniel
's
drawings
too
closely
making
them
too
difficult
to
animate
and
that
the
overall
tone
of
perkins
'
script
was
too
grotesque
and
dark.3
realising
the
amount
of
work
needed
for
alice
in
wonderland
as
well
as
the
economic
devastation
of
the
world
war
ii
and
the
production
demands
of
pinocchio
fantasia
and
bambi
walt
shelved
production
on
alice
in
wonderland
shortly
after
the
screening.5
in
1945
shortly
after
the
war
ended
disney
once
again
revived
alice
in
wonderland
and
assigned
british
author
aldous
huxley
to
re-write
the
script
.
however
walt
felt
that
huxley
's
version
was
too
much
of
a
literal
adaptation
of
carroll
's
book.5
background
artist
mary
blair
submitted
some
concept
drawings
for
alice
in
wonderland
.
blair
's
paintings
moved
away
from
tenneil
's
sketchy
illustrations
by
taking
a
modernist
stance
using
bold
and
unreal
colors
.
walt
liked
blair
's
designs
and
the
script
was
re-written
to
focus
on
comedy
music
and
the
whimsical
side
to
carroll
's
book.5
disney
toyed
with
the
idea
of
having
a
live-actionanimated
version
of
alice
in
wonderland
in
a
similar
fashion
to
his
alice
comedies
that
would
star
ginger
rogers
and
would
utilize
the
recently
developed
sodium
vapor
process.6
lisa
davis
waltz
who
would
later
voice
anita
radcliffe
in
one
hundred
and
one
dalmatians
and
luana
patten
were
also
considered
for
the
role
of
alice.57
however
walt
soon
realised
that
he
could
only
do
justice
to
the
book
by
making
an
all
animated-feature
and
in
1946
work
began
on
an
all-animated
version
of
alice
in
wonderland.3
writingedit
through
various
drafts
of
the
script
many
sequences
that
were
present
in
caroll
's
book
drifted
in
and
out
of
the
story
.
however
walt
insisted
that
the
scenes
themselves
keep
close
to
those
in
the
novel
since
most
of
its
humor
is
in
the
writing.3
one
omitted
scene
from
the
1939
treatment
of
the
film
occurred
outside
the
duchess
'
manor
where
the
fish
footman
is
giving
a
message
to
the
the
frog
footman
to
take
to
the
duchess
saying
that
she
is
invited
to
play
croquet
with
the
queen
of
hearts
.
alice
overhears
this
and
sneaks
into
the
kitchen
of
the
manor
where
she
finds
the
duchess
'
cook
maniacally
cooking
and
the
duchess
nursing
her
baby
.
the
cook
is
spraying
pepper
all
over
the
room
causing
the
duchess
and
alice
to
sneeze
and
the
baby
to
cry
.
after
a
quick
conversation
between
alice
and
the
duchess
the
quick-tempered
cook
starts
throwing
pots
and
pans
at
the
noisy
baby
.
alice
rescues
the
baby
but
as
she
leaves
the
house
the
baby
turns
into
a
pig
and
runs
away.8
the
scene
was
scrapped
for
pacing
reasons
.
another
scene
that
was
deleted
from
a
later
draft
occurred
in
tulgey
wood
where
alice
encountered
what
appeared
to
be
a
sinister-looking
jabberwocky
hiding
in
the
dark
before
revealing
himself
as
a
comical
looking
dragon-like
beast
with
bells
and
factory
whistles
on
his
head
.
a
song
``
beware
the
jabberwock
''
was
also
written
.
however
the
scene
was
scrapped
in
favor
of
the
walrus
and
the
carpenter
poem.3
in
desire
to
keep
the
jabberwocky
poem
in
the
film
it
was
made
to
replace
an
original
song
for
the
chesire
cat
``
i
'm
mad
''
another
deleted
scene
in
tulgey
wood
shows
alice
consulting
with
the
white
knight
which
was
meant
to
be
somewhat
of
a
caracature
of
walt
disney
.
although
walt
liked
the
scene
he
felt
it
was
better
if
alice
learned
her
lesson
by
herself
hence
the
song
``
very
good
advice
''
3
other
characters
such
as
the
mock
turtle
and
the
gryphon
were
discarded
for
pacing
reasons
.
musicedit
in
an
effort
to
retain
some
of
carroll
's
imaginative
verses
and
poems
disney
commissioned
top
songwriters
to
compose
songs
built
around
them
for
use
in
the
film
.
a
record
number
of
potential
songs
were
written
for
the
film
based
on
carroll
's
versesâover
30âand
many
of
them
found
a
way
into
the
film
if
only
for
a
few
brief
moments
.
alice
in
wonderland
would
boast
the
greatest
number
of
songs
included
in
any
disney
film
but
because
some
of
them
last
for
mere
seconds
like
``
how
do
you
do
and
shake
hands
''
``
we
'll
smoke
the
monster
out
''
``
't
was
brillig
''
``
the
caucus
race
''
and
others
this
fact
is
frequently
overlooked
.
the
original
song
that
alice
was
to
sing
in
the
beginning
was
titled
``
beyond
the
laughing
sky
''
.
the
song
like
so
many
other
dropped
songs
was
not
used
by
the
producers
.
however
the
composition
was
kept
and
the
lyrics
were
changed
.
it
later
became
the
title
song
for
peter
pan
which
was
in
production
at
the
same

release
and
receptionedit
at
the
time
these
creative
decisions
were
met
with
great
criticism
from
fans
of
lewis
carroll
as
well
as
from
british
film
and
literary
critics
who
accused
disney
of
``
americanizing
''
a
great
work
of
english
literature.9
disney
was
not
surprised
by
the
critical
reception
to
alice
in
wonderland
â
his
version
of
alice
was
intended
for
large
family
audiences
not
literary
critics
â
but
despite
all
the
long
years
of
thought
and
effort
the
film
met
with
a
lukewarm
response
at
the
box
office
and
was
a
sharp
disappointment
in
its
initial
release10
earning
an
estimated
2.4
million
at
the
us
box
office
in
1951.11
though
not
an
outright
disaster
the
film
was
never
re-released
theatrically
in
walt
disney
's
lifetime
airing
instead
every
so
often
on
network
television
.
in
fact
alice
in
wonderland
aired
as
the
second
episode
of
walt
disney
's
disneyland
tv
series
on
abc
in
1954
in
a
severely
edited
version
cut
down
to
less
than
an
hour
.
in
the
disney
films
leonard
maltin
relates
animator
ward
kimball
felt
the
film
failed
because
``
it
suffered
from
too
many
cooks
â
directors
.
here
was
a
case
of
five
directors
each
trying
to
top
the
other
guy
and
make
his
sequence
the
biggest
and
craziest
in
the
show
.
this
had
a
self-canceling
effect
on
the
final
product
.
``
12
walt
disney
himself
felt
that
the
film
failed
because
alice
the
character
had
no
``
heart
.
``
13
almost
two
decades
after
its
original
release
after
the
north
american
success
of
george
dunning
's
animated
film
yellow
submarine
1968
disney
's
version
of
alice
in
wonderland
suddenly
found
itself
in
vogue
with
the
times
.
in
fact
because
of
mary
blair
's
art
direction
and
the
long-standing
association
of
carroll
's
alice
in
wonderland
with
the
drug
culture
the
feature
was
re-discovered
as
something
of
a
``
head
film
''
along
with
fantasia
and
the
three
caballeros
among
the
college-aged
and
was
shown
in
various
college
towns
across
the
country
.
the
disney
company
resisted
this
association
and
even
withdrew
prints
of
the
film
from
universities
but
then
in
1974
the
disney
company
gave
alice
in
wonderland
its
first
theatrical
re-release
ever
and
the
company
even
promoted
it
as
a
film
in
tune
with
the
``
psychedelic
''
times
mostly
from
the
hit
song
``
white
rabbit
''
performed
by
jefferson
airplane
.
this
re-release
was
so
successful
it
warranted
a
subsequent
re-release
in
1981
.
its
first
uk
re-release
was
on
july
26
1979
.
by
the
1980s
the
initial
consensus
of
the
movie
proved
to
be
outdated

the

gained
critical
acclaim

became
