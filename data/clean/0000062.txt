of

holden
caulfield
is
one
of
the
best-loved
fictional
characters
in
american
literature
.
like
another
popular
character
huck
finn
holden
tells
his
own
story
in
his
own
words
as
if
speaking
aloud
and
it
is
holden
's
``
voice
''
on
the
page
rather
than
the
plot
of
the
catcher
in
the
rye
for
which
the
novel
is
most
remembered
.
although
the
catcher
in
the
rye
seems
like
the
unedited
thoughts
and
feelings
of
an
actual
teenager
it
is
nothing
of
the
kind
.
actually
j.d
.
salinger
was
in
his
twenties
and
thirties
when
he
wrote
the
novel
which
began
as
a
short
story
and
grew
over
many
years
into
a
book
length
work
of
fiction
.
the
novel
's
main
thematic
conflict
pits
the
innocence
and
authenticity
of
childhood
as
represented
by
holden
's
sister
phoebe
against
the
phoniness
as
holden
sees
it
of
most
adults
mr.
antolini
for
example
.
neither
a
child
nor
a
grownup
holden
resists
maturation
a
process
he
sees
as
characterized
by
loss
rather
than
growth
