this
book
to
many
seems
like
a
teenage
boy
complaining
about
everything
and
everyone
he
possibly
can
.
i
read
the
book
2
times
before
trulyâmorethis
book
to
many
seems
like
a
teenage
boy
complaining
about
everything
and
everyone
he
possibly
can
.
i
read
the
book
2
times
before
truly
understanding
and
3
more
after
that
.
the
novel
is
a
coming
of
age
novel
because
the
author
portrays
the
thoughts
of
a
teenager
in
depth
greatly
.
holden
main
character
tends
to
ramble
on
and
worry
and
not
understand
how
he
is
feeling
something
most
teenagers
experience
.
he
does
n't
understand
the
world
or
anyone
and
he
feels
as
if
they
feel
that
way
about
him
.
it
is
something
you
have
to
look
deeply
at
.
for
example
in
one
portion
he
is
talking
about
a
girl
he
used
to
like
and
how
his
good
friend
disrespected
her
and
holden
says
``
he
does
n't
care
if
she
keeps
her
kings
in
the
back
row
or
not
.
''
this
is
making
a
reference
to
when
him
and
the
girl
used
to
play
chess
and
she
'd
do
that
and
holden
remembered
years
later
even
though
it
was
such
a
small
thing
but
his
friend
does
n't
care
about
getting
to
know
the
little
parts
of
her
he
just
wanted
to
have
sex
.
so
this
book
has
to
offer
a
lesson
that
you
are
not
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
has
ever
felt
the
strange
and
confused
feelings
you
may
have
felt
in
the
past
or
currently
.
you
are
not
the
only
person
to
care
about
small
or
stupid
things
and
feel
things
you
do
n't
understand
.
keep
in
mind
that
the
message
may
not
always
be
so
clear.less

is
not

a
whole

because
there
is
a

she
'll

you
pete

will
never

i
have
on
the
agenda
today
is
to
go
to
the
gym
and
then
off
to
keracik
's
american
lit
class
.
it
is
not
a
bad
class
although
it
is
nowhere
close
to
gender
studies
with
halberstam
.
or
davidoff
's
survey
of
modern
postmodernism
last
semester
.
now
that
was
a
class
it
blew
my
mind
.
so
many
things
to
think
about
.
the
reading
in
american
lit
has
been
okay
.
but
we
've
been
assigned
to
read
catcher
in
the
rye
and
it
is
terrible
.
ca
n't
believe
i
ever
liked
this
book
.
caulfield
is
a
whiny
little
bitch
.
the
book
has
no
depth
.
there
is
literally
nothing
going
on
with
the
narrative
style
theme
characterization
it
is
just
one
rote
clichã
after
another
.
he
thinks
he
is
such
a
rebel-without-a-cause
but
in
reality
he
is
just
another
tired
representation
of
rootless
stereotypical
masculinity
and
gender
essentialism
.
completely
inane
and
without
meaning
.
i
think
my
essay
will
use
some
acker-style
postmodernist
techniques
to
show
how
simplistic
this
trite
``
classic
''
truly
is

how

just

parts

brought
back
all
that
old
angst
about
all
the
fucked-up
shit
in
the

that

have
to
deal

cracked

read
some
of
my
favorite
parts

what
an
inspiration
seriously
that
is
a
classic
novel
.
it
is
packed
with
meaning
.
i
'm
twice
caulfield
's
age
but
i
still
somehow
connect
with
him
in
a
very
direct
way
.
my
life
is
going
to
change
and
the
attitude
expressed
in
that
book
is
at
the
heart
of
that
change
.
i
love
you

deeply
fulfilling

every

something
meaningful
happens

so
emotional
and
real

sometimes
i
find
myself
just
losing
it
in
a
fetal
position

of
the
things
i
've
seen
.
working
with
people
who
are
drug
addicted
or
who
have
been
abused
or
who
are
dying
is
heavy

it
is
also
beautiful

it
's
hard

i
am
dealing
with
all
of
that

back
to
her
roots
in

's

does
she
think
that
having
a
child
with
me
will
bring
more
meaning
into
her
life
my
life
has
meaning
enough
already
.
and
i
really
am
not
sure
i
can
handle
that
responsibility
on
top
of
everything
else.i
skimmed
a
catcher
in
the
rye
yesterday
after
an
awkward
talk
with
marcy
about
having
a
baby
.
it
was
not
an
inspiring
read
.
caulfield
is
so
full
of
misplaced
angst
i
'm
not
sure
i
even
understand
him
anymore
.
why
is
he
so
pissed
off
he
's
seen
nothing
of
the
world
and
what
the
world
can
actually
do
to
people
.
i
want
to
like
him
i
want
to
re-capture
that
feeling
of
affection
i
had
for
him
but
now
his
contempt
and
his
anger
just
seem
so
meaningless
so
naive
.
he
really
does
not
have
it
so
bad
.
there
is
so
much
worse
out
there
.
i
do
n't
know
how
i
would
handle
a
kid
like
that
.
i
hate
to
say
it
but
i
constantly
rolled
my
eyes
when
reading
it
.
oh
the
emotional
self-absorption
of
youth
just
you
wait
caulfield
.
it
sure
gets
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
complicated
once
you
grow
up.journal
entrytoday
i
am
40
years
old
.
when
did
i
become
a
boss
it
is
like
i
woke
up
one
day
mysteriously
transformed
into
an
old
man
.
am
i
really
a
``
leader
''
what
does
that
even
mean
sometimes
i
feel
like
i
am
just
faking
it
all
and
someone
is
going
to
figure
it
out
and
blow
the
whistle
on
me
.
last
week
i
made
a
huge
play
on
the
council
i
had
all
my
ducks
in
a
row
and
all
the
votes
came
in
just
as
i
had
planned
.
everyone
has
their
own
agenda
and
the
way
to
get
things
done
is
simply
to
recognize
and
engage
with
that
disappointing
fact
.
some
folks
got
up
and
started
clapping
and
then
the
whole
room
joined
in
even
council
members
who
voted
against
my
motion
-
feh
phonies
.
the
experience
was
sort
of
amazing
but
it
also
made
me
feel
very
odd
almost
disconnected
from
myself
.
is
this
who
i
am
now
a
public
policy
figure
a
community
advocate
a
mayoral
appointee
ugh
i
ca
n't
stand
the
mayor
.
i
do
n't
feel
like
me
.
there
is
accomplishment
there
and
some
satisfaction
...
but
i
am
missing
something
something
visceral
something
real
.
sweet
jesus
is
this
what
a
mid-life
crisis
feels
like
it
is
a
weird
feeling
like
i
know
everything
that
i
need
to
know
about
the
world
about
the
people
around
me
how
everything
connects
but
yet
i
still
feel
like
i
know
so
little
about
life
.
oh
such
angst
mark
.
surely
you
've
outgrown
thisi
've
started
re-reading
a
catcher
in
the
rye
.
it
's
so
strange
during
different
parts
i
felt
like
crying
.
a
wonderful
and
moving
novel
.
i
feel
like
i
really
understand
holden
like
he
is
my
guide
my
son
my
brother
my
friend
...
myself
.
i
think
of
him
and
i
know
that
change
in
the
world
and
changing
myself
can
still
happen
.
it
just
has
to
happen
.
that
's
life
after
all
right

at
any
rate
it
was
a
ringing
endorsement.so
you
can
imagine
my
disappointment
when
i
hated
it
.
not
only
did
i
hate
holden
but
i
hated
everything
about
the
novel
.
there
was
nothing
i
enjoyed
.
i
did
my
book
report
where
i
confessed
my
hatred
which
led
my
teacher
to
confess
that
she
did
too
but
i
could
n't
let
it
go
.
i
honestly
felt
that
my
loathing
of
a
novel
that
so
many
others
found
``
life-changing
''
indicated
some
deep
and
horrible
flaw
.
i
felt
like
hating
catcher
in
the
rye
was
my
dirty
little
secret.time
passed
and
my
self-loathing
mellowed
.
i
began
to
think
that
perhaps
i
'd
come
at
it
too
young
so
after
my
first
year
of
college
i
decided
to
re-read
it
go
at
it
with
fresh
eyes
and
see
if
my
opinion
had
changed.here
's
the
thing
it
has
n't
.
i
get
it
.
i
get
that
holden
is
supposed
to
be
loathsome
.
i
get
that
he
is
the
hypocrite
he
hates
.
i
get
that
almost
all
teenagers
go
through
the
kind
of
thinking
he
experiences
.
i
get
it
.
i
do
.
i
just
do
n't
like
it.oh
and
i
'm
not
ashamed
anymore

the
last

it
was
about
a
thousand

i
was
lousy

i
really

now
that
iâm

thatâs

makes
me
want
to
give
the
writer
a
buzz
and
ask
what
the
hell
is
going
on
.
itâs
like
they
are
trying
to
give
you
the
time
in
the
back
of
a
cab
when
you
donât
feel
like
getting
the
time
at
all
.
itâs
damn
depressing
i
swear
to
god
it
is
.
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
you
probably
couldnât
even
talk
to
a
phony
writer
on
the
phone
.
you
would
just
end
up
talking
to
his
butler
or
some
snobbish
person
like
that
and
asking
if
they
would
give
the
writer
your
message
.
he
probably
wouldnât
even
do
it
.
the
thing
with
guys
like
that
is
that
they
will
never
give
writers
your
messages
.
thatâs
something
that
annoys
the
hell
out
of
me
.
turns
out
this
is
still
a
damn
good
book
.
salinger
kid
is
a
great
writer
.
he
really
is
.
maybe
iâm
still
just
an
angst-ridden
sonuvabitch
but
this
part
kills
meâall
the
kids
kept
trying
to
grab
for
the
gold
ring
and
so
was
old
phoebe
and
i
was
sort
of
afraid
sheâd
fall
off
the
goddam
horse
but
i
didnât
say
anything
or
do
anything
.
the
thing
with
kids
is
if
they
want
to
grab
for
the
gold
ring
you
have
to
let
them
do
it
and
not
say
anything
.
if
they
fall
off
they
fall
off
but
itâs
bad
if
you
say
anything
to
them.âp.211iâll
bet
everyone
is
going
to
think
that
iâm
just
horsinâ
around
or
trying
to
be
all
sexy
talking
like
this
.
the
reason
for
this
corny
review
is
because
a
thousand
other
people
have
already
written
reviews
for
this
book
and
iâll
bet
that
they
have
already
said
everything
that
i
want
to
say
.
itâs
pretty
depressing
.
it
really
is
.
thatâs
about
all
that
iâm
going
to
talk
about
.
now
i
just
hope
that
no
one
writes
âfuck
youâ
on
this
review
.
thatâs
the
thing
with
some
people
they
are
always
sneaking
up
and
writing
âfuck
youâ
on
your
book
reviews
when
you
are
not
looking
.
they
really
are

his
extraordinary
sensitivity
i
mean
come
on
he
had
a
nervous
breakdown
for
god
's
sake
he
had
to
be
sensitive
.
at
sixteen
i
wanted
to
marry
holden
caulfield
.
at
forty
i
want
to
spank
him
.
after
all
holden
's
indictment
of
society
boils
down
to
the
``
insight
''
that
everybody
is
a
phony
.
that
's
the
kind
of
insight
a
sixteen
year
old
considers
deep
.
a
forty
year
old
of
the
grown-up
variety
recognizes
holden
's
insight
as
superficial
and
banal
indulging
in
the
cheapest
kind
of
adolescent
posturing
.
it
suggests
a
grasp
of
society
and
of
human
nature
that
's
about
as
complex
as
an
episode
of
dawson
's
creek
.
holden
and
his
adolescent
peers
typically
behave
as
though
the
fate
they
have
suffered
disillusionment
and
the
end
of
innocence
is
unique
in
human
history
.
he
ca
n't
see
beyond
the
spectacle
of
his
own
disillusionment
and
neither
can
j.
d.
salinger
for
all
his
painful
self-consciousness
holden
caulfield
is
not
really
self-aware
.
he
ca
n't
see
that
he
himself
is
a
phony
.
compare
salinger
's
novel
of
arrested
development
for
instance
with
a
real
bildungsroman
great
expectations
.
holden
caulfield
is
an
adolescent
reflecting
on
childhood
and
adolescence
pip
pirrip
is
an
adult
reflecting
on
childhood
and
adolescence
.
holden
caulfield
has
the
tunnel
vision
of
teendom
and
he
depicts
events
with
an
immediacy
and
absorption
in
the
experience
that
blocks
out
the
broader
context
the
larger
view
.
pip
pirrip
has
the
wonderful
double
vision
of
a
sensitive
adult
recollecting
the
sensitive
child
he
used
to
be
he
conveys
at
the
same
time
the
child
's
compelling
perspective
and
the
adult
's
thoughtful
revision
of
events
.
while
holden
caulfield
litters
his
narrative
with
indignant
exposes
of
phonies
and
frauds
pip
pirrip
skillfully
concentrates
on
``
the
spurious
coin
of
his
own
make
''
--
that
is
without
letting
the
child
pip
and
the
adolescent
pip
in
on
the
joke
he
exposes
himself
as
a
phony
.
pip
pirrip
grows
up
.
holden
caulfield
has
a
nervous
breakdown
.
i
suppose
the
only
reason
i
begrudge
him
his
breakdown
is
that
so
many
in
our
culture
--
many
more
unfortunately
than
just
the
legitimate
adolescents
among
us
--
seem
fixated
on
holden
as
a
symbol
of
honesty
and
socially-liberating
rebellion
.
we
view
nervous
collapse
and
dysfunction
as
a
badge
of
honor
a
sign
--
to
put
it
in
caulfieldian
terms
--
that
we
are
discerning
enough
to
see
through
all
the
crap
.
our
celebration
of
overwrought
disaffection
reminds
me
of
the
last
sentence
of
joyceâs
araby
âgazing
up
into
the
darkness
i
saw
myself
as
a
creature
driven
and
derided
by
vanity
and
my
eyes
burned
with
anguish
and
anger.â
here
is
the
adolescent
pose
non-pareil
.
equally
self-accusing
and
self-aggrandizing
it
captures
the
adolescent
at
the
precise
moment
when
his
own
disillusionment
becomes
the
object
of
his
grandiose
and
self-dramatizing
vision
.
thatâs
the
kind
of
crap
that
holden
caulfield
and
j.
d.
salinger
can
not
see
through
.
and
it
is
often
the
kind
of
crap
that
we
âadultsâ
like
to
slosh
around
in
.
the
barney
beating
of
several
years
ago
is
another
symptom
of
our
arrested
adolescence
our
inability
to
ride
the
wave
of
disillusion
into
the
relatively
calm
harbor
of
adulthood
--
as
though
flailing
around
in
the
storm
and
raging
at
the
wind
were
in
themselves
marks
of
distinction
and
a
superior
sensibility
.
i
remember
a
news
story
about
a
woman
in
a
barney
costume
being
seriously
injured
when
a
rabid
and
probably
drunken
anti-barney
fanatic
attacked
the
big
purple
dinosaur
at
some
public
event
.
now
i
donât
know
the
age
of
the
barney-beater
but
the
act
itself
is
a
supremely
adolescent
one
in
which
the
impulsive
response
to
disillusionment
is
to
lash
out
at
those
symbols
of
childhood
which
made
the
biggest
dupes
of
us
.
at
the
dawn
of
adolescence
when
barney
begins
to
appear
cloying
and
false
it
seems
natural
to
want
to
beat
up
on
him
as
though
it
was
barney
himself
who
pulled
one
over
on
us
instead
of
our
own
poignant
and
necessary
misapprehension
of
the
nature
of
things
.
i
could
see
holden
caulfield
beating
up
on
barney
at
least
rhetorically
and
i
could
see
holden
caulfield
missing
barney
as
he
misses
all
the
âphoniesâ
at
the
end
of
the
book
but
i
can
not
see
holden
caulfield
accepting
the
postlapsarian
barney
on
new
terms
as
a
figure
who
is
meant
for
children
and
not
for
him
.
for
all
his
touching
poses
about
wanting
to
be
the
âcatcher
in
the
ryeâ
what
holden
really
wants
is
not
to
save
children
but
to
be
a
child
again
.

in

as
i
started

i
was
already
thinking
about
what
my
amazingly
insightful
completely
âisnât
it
cool
to
bash
on
the
classicsâ
1
star
review
was
going
to
focus
on
.
i
thought
maybe
i
could
bag
on
the
less
than
spectacular
prose
used
by
salinger
making
myself
feel
really
smart
in
the
process
.
or
maybe
i
could
take
some
jabs
at
the
less
than
exciting
narrative
pacing
and
throw
in
a
few
references
to
``
watching
paint
dry
''
.
in
the
end
i
thought
my
most
likely
avenue
for
attacking
reviewing
this
anthem
of
teen
angst
was
that
it
was
utterly
yawn
inspiringno
longer
relevant
today
because
of
the
glut
of
teen
angst
that
the
recent
generations
have
been
exposed
to
ad
nauseam
growing
up
.
i
mean
we
live
in
a
time
in
which
teen
angst
is
everywhere
and
even
has
its
own
sub-genre
label
now
.
you
can
find
it
inmusic
...

...
movies

...
and
even
the
shitty
popular
literature
of
our
times
...
literature
is
a
serious
stretch
but
i
must
admit
that
these
books
do
in
fact
fill
me
with
angst
...
so
what
happened
to
all
of
the
preconceived
notions
i
had
before
i
starting
reading
this
book
instead
i
found
myself
completely
drawn
into
the
rich
nuanced
story
of
holden
caulfield
.
i
found
myself
empathizing
with
caulfield
almost
from
the
beginning
something
i
did
not
expect
to
do
.
his
``
annoying
''
``
pseudo
rebellious
''
and
``
just
do
n't
care
''
exterior
were
so
obviously
manufactured
and
so
patently
hiding
a
seriously
sad
and
lost
boy
that
i
was
transfixed
on
finding
the
real
holden
caulfield
.
despite
the
book
being
written
``
in
holden
's
own
words
''
the
reader
was
still
able
to
discern
that
holden
's
surface
response
to
a
situation
was
hiding
a
much
deeper
emotional
resposne
.
for
salinger
to
be
able
to
infuse
that
kind
of
nuance
into
the
sparse
prose
of
caulfieldâs
narrative
was
nothing
short
of
brilliant
in
my
opinion
.
caulfied
is
lazy
.
he
is
stubborn
.
he
is
immature
.
he
is
unfocused
.
he
is
untruthful
.
he
is
dangerously
short-sighted
and
he
is
lost
in
his
own
world
or
unrealistic
expectations
.
sounds
like
that
could
certainly
be
a
not
unsubstantial
portion
of
the
male
16
year
old
population
.
however
after
reading
this
book
i
learned
a
few
other
things
about
holden
that
i
though
were
fascinating
and
that
are
not
as
often
discussed1
.
he
is
desperately
lonely
he
even
goes
so
far
as
ask
his
cab
drivers
to
join
him
for
a
drink2
.
he
is
generous
with
his
time
and
his
things
he
writes
an
essay
for
his
roommate
despite
being
upset
with
him
and
even
lets
him
borrow
his
jacket
3
.
he
is
extremely
sensitive
and
longs
for
an
emotional
rather
than
just
a
physical
commitment
he
mentions
several
times
his
need
to
âbe
in
loveâ
in
order
to
be
physical
and
his
experience
with
the
prostitute
certainly
bears
this
out4
.
he
is
intelligent
despite
being
lazy
and
unfocused
holden
displays
great
insight
and
intelligence
regarding
books
he
has
read
and
displays
at
the
museum
and
5
.
despite
being
unable
to
process
it
correctly
he
is
full
of
compassion
and
has
a
deep
capacity
for
love
which
he
shows
most
notably
for
his
sister
this
was
one
of
the
most
powerful
parts
of
the
story
for
me
as
it
was
holdenâs
desire
to
avoid
hurting
phoebe
that
keeps
him
from
running
away
at
the
end
of
the
book
.
taking
all
of
the
good
and
the
bad
together
i
was
left
with
the
feeling
that
holden
is
an
adolescent
on
the
cusp
of
adulthood
who
is
achingly
afraid
of
the
loss
of
his
childhood
and
the
responsibility
and
commitment
that
he
sees
as
required
to
make
it
in
the
âadultâ
world
.
he
is
compassionate
intelligent
and
deeply
emotional
and
yet
is
unable
or
unwilling
to
focus
that
energy
on
those
steps
that
he
sees
as
leading
him
away
from
his
âhappy
memories
of
childhoodâ
and
closer
to
the
âscary
world
of
the
adult.â
i
think
this
is
superbly
shown
in
holden
's
expressed
dream
of
wanting
to
being
the
âcatcher
in
the
rye.â
quick
side
note
i
had
no
idea
what
the
title
to
the
book
referred
to
until
i
just
read
the
book
.
here
is
a
person
so
afraid
of
growing
up
and
so
averse
to
giving
into
the
pain
and
sadness
that
he
sees
as
the
result
of
becoming
an
adult
that
he
wants
nothing
more
than
to
spend
his
life
protecting
others
from
losing
the
innocence
of
childhood
.
big
crazy
âi
want
to
save
the
worldâ
dreams
are
a
wonderful
part
of
childhood
and
it
is
a
shame
that
such
ideas
and
beliefs
are
too
often
destroyed
under
the
barrage
of
âyou
really
need
to
grow
upâ
rather
than
having
such
dreams
transitioned
and
re-focused
into
daring
the
improbable
within
the
world
of
the
possible
.
a
great
and
moving
reading
experience
and
one
that
i
give
my
highest
possible
recommendation

've
taken

and
had
prolonged
conversations
on
the
street
with
prostitutes
not
concerning
business
matters
and
i
can
attest
that
salinger
's
depiction
is
often
accurate
to
what
it
feels
like
to
go
through
an
average
unremarkable
day
.
however
reading
about
an
average
day
is
no
more
interesting
than
living
one.beyond
that
salinger
does
n't
have
the
imagination
to
paint
people
as
strangely
as
they
really
are
.
chekhov
's
'normal
'
little
people
seem
more
real
and
alive
than
salinger
's
because
chekhov
injects
a
little
oddness
a
little
madness
into
each
one
.
real
people
are
almost
never
quite
as
boring
as
modernist
depictions
because
everyone
has
at
least
some
ability
to
surprise
you.salinger
's
world
is
desaturated
.
emotions
and
moments
seep
into
one
another
indistinct
as
the
memories
of
a
drunken
party
.
little
importance
is
granted
to
events
or
thoughts
but
simply
pass
by
each
duly
tallied
by
an
author
in
the
role
of
court
reporter.what
is
interesting
about
this
book
is
not
that
it
is
realistically
bland
but
that
it
is
artificially
bland
.
yet
as
ridiculous
a
concept
as
that
is
it
still
takes
itself
entirely
in
earnest
never
acknowledging
the
humor
of
its
own
blase
hyperbole.this
allows
the
book
to
draw
legions
of
fans
from
all
of
the
ridiculously
dull
people
who
take
themselves
as
seriously
as
holden
takes
himself
.
they
read
it
not
as
a
parody
of
bland
egotism
but
a
celebration
poised
to
inspire
all
the
bland
egotists
who
have
resulted
from
the
new
egalitarianism
in
art
poetry
music
and
academia.those
same
folks
who
treat
rationality
and
intellectual
fervor
like
a
fashion
to
be
followed
imagining
that
the
only
thing
required
to
be
brilliant
is
to
mimic
the
appearance
and
mannerisms
of
the
brilliant
as
if
black
berets
were
the
cause
of
poetic
inspiration
and
not
merely
a
symptom.one
benefit
of
this
is
that
one
can
generally
sniff
out
pompous
faux
intellectuals
by
the
sign
that
they
hold
up
holden
as
a
sort
of
messianic
figure
.
anyone
who
marks
out
holden
as
a
role-model
is
either
a
deluded
teen
with
an
inflated
sense
of
entitlement
or
is
trying
to
relive
the
days
when
they
were.but
what
is
more
interesting
is
that
those
who
idolize
holden
tend
to
be
those
who
most
misunderstand
him
.
upon
close
inspection
he
's
not
depressive
not
consumed
with
ennui
or
an
existential
crisis
he
's
actually
suffering
from
'shell
shock
'
--
now
known
as
'post-traumatic
stress
disorder'.the
way
he
thinks
about
his
brother
's
and
classmate
's
deaths
--
going
over
the
details
again
and
again
in
his
mind
but
with
no
emotional
connection
--
it
's
not
symptomatic
of
depression
but
of
psychological
trauma
.
he
is
stuck
in
a
cycle
unable
to
process
events
going
over
them
again
and
again
but
never
able
to
return
to
normalcy.it
takes
a
certain
kind
of
self-centered
prick
to
look
at
someone
's
inability
to
cope
with
the
reality
of
death
and
think
``
hey
that
's
just
like
my
mild
depression
over
how
my
parents
wo
n't
buy
me
a
newer
ipod
''
it
's
not
an
unusual
stance
in
american
literature
--
there
's
an
arrogant
detachment
in
american
thought
which
has
become
less
and
less
pertinent
as
the
world
grows
and
changes
.
as
recently
as
the
road
we
have
american
authors
comparing
a
difficult
father-son
relationship
to
the
pain
and
turmoil
of
an
african
civil
war
survivor
--
and
winning
awards
for
displaying
their
insensitive
arrogance.perhaps
it
's
time
we
woke
up
and
realized
that
the
well-fed
despondence
of
the
white
man
should
not
be
equated
with
a
lifetime
of
death
starvation
war
and
traumas
both
physical
and
emotional
.
and
as
for
salinger
--
a
real
sufferer
of
post-traumatic
stress
who
was
one
of
the
first
soldiers
to
see
a
concentration
camp
who
described
how
you
can
never
forget
the
smell
of
burning
flesh
--
i
can
only
imagine
how
he
felt
when
people
read
his
story
of
a
man
crippled
by
the
thought
of
death
and
thought
to
themselves
``
yes
that
's
just
what
it
's
like
to
be
a
trustafarian
with
uncool
parents
''
.
no
wonder
he
became
a
recluse
and
stopped
publishing
.

a

boy
from
new
york
was
quite
unlike
kids
his
age
.
he
had
no
interest
in
being
popular
or
social
.
from
the
very
beginning
he
lets
us
into
part
of
his
personal
life
.
his
parents
are
very
touchy
and
his
mother
is
especially
protective
.
it
becomes
clear
very
quickly
where
holdenâs
interests
lie
and
where
they
start
to
veer
off
.
he
tends
to
lean
away
from
the
fake
in
the
world
and
is
a
teller
of
what
is
real
.
holden
is
not
a
fan
of
the
movies
at
all
.
he
saw
his
brother
d.b
.
throw
away
his
natural
writing
talent
all
for
a
large
hollywood
check
.
any
other
boy
holdenâs
age
would
have
been
absolutely
ecstatic
to
have
a
sibling
working
amongst
the
stats
in
hollywood
but
not
holden
.
it
was
all
far
too
âphonyâ
for
him
and
phony
is
his
worst
enemy
.
salingerâs
use
of
sarcasm
and
irony
is
beautiful
and
hilarious
.
as
i
read
through
each
chapter
i
found
myself
highlighting
funny
sarcastic
things
holden
would
say
or
think
and
trust
me
there
are
dozens
of
time
where
this
occurs
.
one
specific
time
in
chapter
8
he
is
talking
to
a
cab
driver
who
is
acting
like
a
real
fool
.
holden
says
to
the
readers
âhe
certainly
was
good
company
.
terrific
personality.â
salingerâs
character
holden
is
actually
a
lot
like
salinger
in
his
real
life
.
like
holden
salinger
was
known
for
his
reclusive
nature
.
uninterested
with
the
fakeness
of
the
world
holden
keeps
his
distance
from
phony
people
.
after
salingerâs
success
of
âthe
catcher
in
the
ryeâ
he
slowed
down
his
publishing
and
slowly
but
surely
drifted
out
of
the
public
eye
.
to
this
day
salinger
refuses
any
offers
to
have
âthe
catcherâ
put
on
the
big
hollywood
screen
.
salingerâs
ex
lover
joyce
maynard
even
once
said
that
âthe
only
person
who
might
ever
have
played
holden
caulfield
would
have
been
j.d
.
salinger.â
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
no
coincidence
that
holden
is
no
fan
of
hollywood
and
that
salinger
in
real
life
and
doesnât
want
anything
to
do
with
turning
his
popular
novel
into
a
movie
.
holden
says
âif
thereâs
one
thing
i
hate
itâs
the
movies
donât
even
mention
them
to
me.âsince
i
have
learned
more
about
salingerâs
personal
life
i
recognize
a
lot
of
salingerâs
personality
in
holden
.
in
the
story
holden
has
overbearing
parents
much
like
salingerâs
parents
.
salinger
said
his
mother
was
over
protective
.
salinger
has
one
sibling
a
sister
which
is
ironic
because
it
is
holdenâs
sister
phoebe
who
has
a
profound
influence
on
holden
.
he
often
talks
about
her
with
very
high
regards.holden
is
not
a
character
who
tried
to
sugarcoat
the
way
he
sees
the
fakeness
around
him
.
holden
making
fun
of
the
people
around
him
often
says
things
like
âyou
wouldâve
pukedâ
and
âit
was
very
phonyâ
.
i
think
that
is
another
one
of
the
reasons
i
like
his
character
so
much
.
for
example
he
is
quite
upset
with
the
fact
that
his
brother
d.b
.
is
selling
his
work
to
hollywood
instead
of
using
his
talents
for
his
own
pleasure
.
holden
even
says
that
his
brother
is
his
favorite
author
.
salinger
himself
is
a
man
who
wrote
for
his
own
pleasure
and
likeness
.
i
made
a
similar
connection
to
a
girl
named
sally
that
holden
likes
in
the
book
to
a
real
life
lover
of
salingerâs
named
oona
.
oona
oâneil
was
self-absorbed
and
stuck
up
according
to
salinger
yet
he
still
phoned
and
wrote
her
letters
quite
often
.
holdenâs
âoonaâ
in
the
story
was
a
girl
named
sally
hayes
.
though
he
found
her
extremely
irritating
he
thought
she
was
very
attractive
as
well
.
after
spending
a
day
with
her
he
pointed
out
about
a
dozen
instances
where
he
thought
she
was
being
âphone
as
hellâ
.
by
the
end
of
their
only
meeting
in
the
book
holden
says
to
sally
âyou
give
me
a
royal
pain
in
the
ass
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth.â
the
real
life
oona
oâneil
ended
up
breaking
it
off
with
salinger
and
married
the
famous
actor
charlie
chaplin.despite
holden
being
a
sixteen
year
old
teenage
boy
he
acts
much
older
than
his
age
.
one
time
in
the
story
he
has
the
chance
to
be
with
a
prostitute
but
instead
of
acting
like
a
pig
he
starts
to
feel
sorry
for
her
and
instead
tried
to
have
a
conversation
with
her
.
he
even
offers
to
pay
her
for
good
conversation
instead
of
for
sex
.
he
also
stays
alone
in
hotels
randomly
drinks
at
bars
and
clubs
often
and
even
tells
people
heâs
older
than
he
really
is
.
but
the
reason
i
find
his
character
mature
and
intellectual
is
for
other
reasons.holden
does
not
hold
money
or
material
things
to
be
really
important
.
he
is
more
excited
to
hang
out
with
his
kid
sister
than
he
is
any
other
time
in
the
entire
book
.
he
is
content
with
something
that
would
probably
be
boring
to
other
guys
his
age.like
many
teenagers
holden
is
often
depressed
.
the
way
he
deals
with
it
most
times
actually
breaks
my
heart
in
a
way
.
he
likes
to
talk
to
his
deceased
kid
brother
allie
.
he
will
take
a
real
event
that
he
can
remember
where
he
was
talking
with
him
and
pretend
he
is
talking
to
him
again
.
he
says
âi
started
talking
out
loud
to
allie
.
i
do
that
sometimes
when
i
get
very
depressed.â
it
is
really
very
heart
wrenching
to
hear
holden
talk
about
his
brother
.
one
of
my
favorite
moments
in
the
book
is
when
holden
and
phoebe
are
talking
in
phoebeâs
room
and
she
points
out
that
holden
doesnât
like
anything
.
holden
responds
quickly
by
saying
âi
like
allie
.
and
i
like
doing
what
iâm
doing
right
now
.
sitting
here
with
you
and
talking
and
thinking
about
stuffââ
phoebe
says
to
holden
âallieâs
dead-you
always
say
that
if
somebodyâs
dead
and
everything
and
in
heaven
then
it
isnât
really
--
â.
holden
interrupts
her
with
his
final
comeback
âi
know
heâs
dead
donât
you
think
i
know
that
i
can
still
like
him
though
canât
i
just
because
somebodyâs
dead
you
donât
just
stop
liking
them
for
godâs
sake-
especially
if
they
were
about
a
thousand
times
nicer
than
the
people
you
know
thatâre
alive
and
all.âone
of
the
most
beautiful
things
about
âthe
catcher
in
the
ryeâ
is
the
way
salinger
uses
symbolism
.
from
holdenâs
red
hunting
hat
to
jane
gallagherâs
checker
playing
technique
salinger
wrapped
up
more
than
meets
the
eye
into
things
you
never
would
have
dreamed
.
the
main
thing
that
drew
me
into
this
story
is
the
realness
of
holdenâs
character
.
he
is
a
teenage
boy
with
a
teenage
boyâs
mind
but
seems
to
have
far
more
common
sense
than
anyone
else
around
him
.
he
is
not
a
jock
.
he
is
not
a
math
whiz
or
a
science
whiz
.
he
is
not
really
interested
in
sports
.
he
sort
of
makes
up
his
own
category
a
category
that
i
call
âthe
genuineâ
.
he
is
on
his
own
a
lot
and
loves
it
at
first
but
happiness
and
love
are
meant
to
be
shared
with
others
.
it
has
a
much
less
meaning
when
by
itself
and
he
realizes
it
by
the
end
of
the
novel
.
he
is
growing
intellectually
little
by
little
throughout
the
whole
book
.
he
realizes
what
really
makes
him
happy
.
i
would
absolutely
recommend
this
book
to
anyone
and
everyone
who
would
like
to
read
a
story
that
could
possibly
change
the
way
they
view
the
world
.
i
have
honestly
laughed
outloud
to
myself
as
i
read
this
story
.
yes
there
is
talk
about
drinking
sex
and
lots
of
cussing
but
if
you
are
going
to
avoid
reading
this
story
because
of
that
then
your
missing
out
on
a
beautiful
masterpiece
.

's
not

overdone

and
his

irked
meif
you
really
want
to
hear
about
it
the
first
thing
you
'll
probably
want
to
know
is
where
i
was
born
and
what
my
lousy
childhood
was
like
and
how
my
parents
were
occupied
and
all
before
they
had
me
and
all
that
david
copperfield
kind
of
crap
but
i
do
n't
feel
like
going
into
it
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
.
that
is
easily
one
of
the
saddest
most
pathetic
introductions
to
a
book
.
patience
is
not
one
of
my
strongest
characteristics
.
holden
's
also
incredibly
stupid
.
page

``
he
was
also
the
nicest
in
lots
of
ways
.
he
never
got
mad
at
anybody
.
people
with
red
hair
are
supposed
to
get
mad
very
easily
but
allie
never
did
and
he
had
very
red
hair
.
i
'll
tell
you
what
kind
of
red
hair
he
had
.
''
-
because
i
need
to
know
what
kind
of
red
hair
he
had
.
and
it
's
not
necessarily
true
that
people
with
red
hair
get
mad
easily.and
why
does
he
say
he
``
sort
of
''
does
things
holden
you
either
do
it
.
or
you
do
n't
.
``
i
sort
of
used
to
go
to
allie
's
baseball
matches
.
``
page
39
``
it
was
around
ten-thirty
i
guess
when
i
finished
it
.
''
also
in
holden
's
eyes
everyone
is
either
a
phony
rude
or
a
moron
.
and
the
only
feelings
he
can
grasp
are
loneliness
and
misery
.
almost
every
answer
to
any
question
on
my
study
guide
always
has
something
to
do
with
holden
wanting
to
talk
to
someone
or
``
discovering
himself
''
or
the
fact
that
everyone
is
a
freaking
phony
.
i
honestly
do
not
care
what
kind
of
a
life
he
dealt
with
.
it
's
not
fair
to
treat
everyone
like
shit
just
because
you
had
a
bad
life
.
i
read
some
of
the
comments
regarding
how
i
did
n't
understand
this
book
because
i
did
n't
relate
to
it
.
that
may
be
true
.
regardless
i
still
think
to
this
day
that
this
book
is
a
drag
and
has
an
unlikable
main
character
and
dry
writing
style
.
perhaps
i
will
read
it
again
when
i
am
older
and
may
enjoy
it
.

as

you
could
start
to
see
things
and
people
as
phony
or
fake
.
maybe
not
people
but
certain
tasks
or
events
certainly
are
.
thereâs
a
constant
struggle
in
all
of
us
between
the
meaningful
and
the
mundane
the
temporary
and
the
eternal
.
there
is
a
conflict
simply
of
time
and
energy
.
we
desire
the
intentional
and
struggle
towards
spirituality
all
while
trying
to
earn
a
paycheck
wash
our
dishes
and
sleep
each
night
.
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
what
i
picture
an
aa
meeting
to
look
like
.
i
think
rarely
could
someone
find
a
place
where
people
are
more
vulnerable
open
and
honest
with
each
other
.
even
if
they
win
over
addictionâ
how
could
life
ever
feel
as
full
after
that
brief
moment
shared
with
others
who
completely
understand
at
the
same
time
the
point
of
those
meetings
is
to
help
people
live-
not
just
free
from
drugs
but
maybe
free
to
live
in
the
mundane
free
to
enjoy
the
dance
of
life
the
needs
of
the
soul
balanced
with
the
chores
too
.
this
doesnât
have
to
be
depressing
but
it
does
require
compromise-
or
a
sense
of
a
time
and
place
for
everything-
including
the
day-to-day.catcher
in
the
rye
touches
on
some
of
these
questions
.
holden
struggles
with
growing
up
.
he
sees
everything
as
meaningless
and
adults
as
predictable
and
fake
.
i
think
he
is
mourning
the
loss
of
his
innocenceâ
maybe
not
just
right
from
wrong
but
the
loss
of
dreams
growing
up
seems
to
require
.
holden
while
at
the
museum
that
is
exactly
the
same
as
it
was
when
he
was
a
kid
says
he
likes
it
because
each
time
you
visit
``
the
only
thing
that
would
be
different
would
be
youâ
''
and
goes
on
to
say
``
certain
things
they
should
stay
the
way
they
are
.
you
ought
to
be
able
to
stick
them
in
one
of
those
big
glass
cases
and
just
leave
them
alone
.
i
know
that
's
impossible
but
itâs
too
bad
anyway
.
''
one
thing
i
thought
of
to
help
explain
holden
's
struggle
with
growing
up
is
this
coffee
.
when
i
was
a
kid
i
used
to
smell
my
dad
's
coffee-
that
strong
sugary-sweet
smell
of
roasted
beans
.
you
wait
for
your
chance
to
be
let
in
on
this
excellent
secret
.
thinking
it
is
just
the
caffeine
that
is
preventing
your
parents
from
giving
you
a
taste
.
finally
they
do
and
then
all
your
dreams
of
that
sweet
flavor
come
crashing
down
it
's
wrecked
coffee
is
n't
at
all
what
you
thought
it
was
that
is
until
the
day
you
give
it
another
chance
you
start
to
be
able
to
smell
and
taste
the
different
tones
coffee
has
.
you
can
appreciate
it
for
its
varied
and
almost
living
flavors
.
you
seeâ
coffee
is
n't
bad-
it
just
was
n't
what
you
always
thought
.
the
key
is
in
finding
the
hidden
flavors
and
getting
over
the
fact
that
it
will
never
taste
as
sweet
as
it
smells
.
i
think
holden
struggled
with
the
initial
shock
that
although
life
is
more
bitter
than
it
``
smells
''
or
than
you
think
it
will
be
there
are
the
hidden
joys
and
sweet
flavors
that
make
it
almost
betterthis
book
doesnât
really
set
out
to
answer
any
of
the
questions
it
raises
.
holden
experiences
the
extremes
of
entering
into
adulthood
and
relates
it
in
a
way
everyone
maybe
especially
teenagers
can
understand
.
he
is
a
flawed
character
who
is
desperate
and
depressed
.
as
the
reader
you
can
see
why
he
feels
the
way
he
does
as
he
explains
it
so
well
you
almost
feel
it
with
him
.
however
you
can
also
see
the
flaws
in
his
thinking
.
the
author
does
n't
romanticize
holden
's
life
you
do
n't
read
it
thinking
he
has
some
special
key
to
life
that
we
all
need
.
you
simply
feel
his
struggle
to
fit
in
and
hope
eventually
he
can
learn
to
play
the
game
and
see
the
beauty
that
is
there
hidden
a
little
.

and
yet
...
i
still
clung
to
this
still
technically
living
legend
as
if
he
were
some
kind
of
talisman
i
could
wear
around
my
neck
a
good
luck
charm
to
ward
off
phonies
and
all
manner
of
soulless
dreck
who
populate
this
despicable
world
writing
'fuck
'
on
grammar
school
walls
and
metaphorical
equivalents
.
after
returning
for
a
few
minutes
to
my
soul-deadening
job
which
--
when
you
really
get
right
down
to
it
--
is
just
another
way
of
killing
time
until
i
join
salinger
in
oblivion
i
started
getting
all
funny-feeling
about
it
.
at
the
risk
of
sounding
like
an
adult
contemporary
power
ballad
written
by
jim
steinman
with
synthesized
violins
in
the
background
i
began
to
feel
as
if
my
adolescence
had
finally
come
to
an
end
.
i
guess
it
's
about
time
.
i
'm
thirty-eight
years
old
and
yet
i
look
at
the
people
who
are
my
age
--
hell
who
are
even
much
younger
than
i
am
--
and
who
appear
in
all
particulars
to
be
adults
and
i
grow
frightenedalarmed
that
they
've
graduated
to
the
'next
level
'
they
're
mating
and
spawning
and
drawing
up
wills
and
completing
their
own
tax
returns
and
investing
money
and
dealing
gracefully
--
or
with
stoicism
with
the
deaths
of
friends
and
relatives
...
and
even
some
of
them
have
died
themselves
of
terrible
diseases
--
the
kinds
of
diseases
which
are
not
content
with
merely
claiming
lives
but
which
demand
the
optimal
human
suffering
the
optimal
dehumanization
before
they
cash
in
.
so
of
course
.
i
love
all
of
salinger
's
writing
but
his
value
in
my
life
has
far
surpassed
that
of
a
'mere
'
literary
pastime
.
he
has
kept
me
company
for
many
years
when
i
felt
left
behind
by
the
exigencies
of
time
and
the
claims
of
'maturity
.
'
in
my
head
i
still
picture
myself
as
a
nineteen-year-old
and
i
'm
shocked
again
and
again
when
somehow
every
other
moron
on
the
planet
seems
to
be
under
the
ridiculous
impression
that
i
'm
a
thirty-eight-year-old
man
.
with
graying
hair
.
and
deepening
crow
's
feet
.
what
idiotsi
know
all
of
this
shit
i
'm
saying
is
clichã
clichã
clichã
.
lots
and
lots
of
people
feel
a
special
connection
to
salinger
's
writing
--
for
just
the
reasons
i
described
--
and
lots
and
lots
of
people
hate
his
writing
because
they
find
it
grating
and
immature
catcher
in
the
rye
or
pretentious
and
ponderous
the
glass
family
stories
.
but
i
felt
compelled
to
commemorate
today
in
some
way
--
however
trite
and
superfluous
--
because
i
sense
again
and
again
with
the
relatively
recent
deaths
of
some
of
my
heroes
like
ingmar
bergman
and
jacques
derrida
for
instance
that
i
am
entering
a
world
that
is
no
longer
safeguarded
by
the
great
men
and
women
of
the
elder
generation
i
am
entering
a
world
in
which
i
am
now
the
elder
...
with
my
own
responsibilities
and
obligations
.
yes
this
still
frightens
me
but
i
'll
always
have
salinger
's
very
particular
and
empathetic
world
to
which
to
retreat
when
i
have
sacrificed
too
much
of
myself
to
a
real
world
i
'll
never
completely
understand
or
feel
at
home
in
.

really

see
to

the
truth
i
am
in
this
p.e.i
.
profile
and
we
are
evaluated
in
every
class
by
criterions
which
means
that
i
had
to
do
six
different
oral
presentations
on
this
classic
and
so
had
to
analyze
everything
orally.nonetheless
there
is
this
one
quote
from
the
book
i
canât
get
out
of
my
mind
and
want
to
share
with
youwhile
dancing
with
some
girl.she
was
really
good
.
all
you
had
to
do
was
touch
her
.
and
when
she
turned
around
her
pretty
little
butt
twitched
so
nice
and
all
.
she
knocked
me
out

i

it
.
i
was
half
in

with
her
by
the
time
we
sat
down

thatâs
the
thing
about
girls

every

they
do
something
pretty
even
if
theyâre
not

to

if

also
iâd
probably
have
to
take
the
time
to
learn
how
to
italicize
things
on
goodreads
which
would
probably
be
worthwhile
but
my
computer
skills
could
easily
be
outshone
by
a
resuscitated
troglodyte
fresh
from
an
ice-block
.
added
to
that
i
donât
know
how
long
i
could
go
on
trying
to
poorly
mimic
the
book
without
wanting
to
puke
i
mean
not
only
is
it
a
crumby
thing
to
do
to
but
itâs
also
phony
as
hell
.
so
what
do
i
think
about
the
madman
exploits
of
old
holden
caufield
perhaps
one
of
the
most
acclaimed
protagonists
in
all
of
american
literature
no
terribly
much
as
a
matter
of
fact
each
time
iâve
read
this
book
i
wanted
to
kill
myself
.
holdenâs
always
saying
things
like
that
i
mean
if
you
were
to
wear
one
blue
sock
and
one
red
sock
and
maybe
slowly
skin
your
shrivelfig
under
the
comforting
cotton
of
a
green
sock
heâd
say
something
like
âgod
how
i
hate
how
that
guy
messes
around
with
his
socks
it
makes
me
want
to
kill
myself.â
in
that
case
youâd
better
hope
youâre
at
least
in
possession
of
a
decent
valise
lest
that
bastard
caulfield
spread
some
more
wrath
upon
you
for
your
clearly
inferior
luggage
.
that
guy
he
really
cracks
me
up
.
i
never
really
understood
why
this
book
is
so
universally
adored
sure
holden
is
a
slacker
the
type
of
clown
that
every
distraught
kid
envisions
themselves
to
be
some
gem
in
the
rough
with
all
the
talent
but
lacking
the
ambition
to
make
a
notable
mark
on
the
world
which
holds
them
back
.
but
you
grow
up
if
only
to
acknowledge
you
have
no
talents
and
still
have
no
ambition
and
instead
of
grabbing
for
that
golden
ring
you
waste
your
time
writing
shitty
reviews
on
shitty
books
here
on
goodreads
on
a
ball-dampeningly
warm
sunday
afternoon
.
come
to
think
of
it
thatâs
probably
why
so
many
appreciate
this
bumbling
tale
like
holden
they
probably
equate
themselves
to
that
misshapen
hunk
of
precious
metal
hidden
beneath
a
untilled
mound
of
nebraskan
soil
laying
in
wait
for
someone
to
unearth
their
sparkling
brilliance
for
all
the
world
to
admire
.
of
course
when
you
realize
tucker
max
probably
felt
the
same
way
you
immediately
bathe
in
bromine
and
shave
what
remains
of
your
flesh
completely
bald
to
scour
the
scourge
as
thoroughly
as
humanly
possible
.
perhaps
it
may
be
slightly
more
promising
to
delude
yourself
than
resigning
your
life
to
the
contemplation
of
just
how
lame
you
actually
are
.
so
hereâs
a
quick
glimpse
of
whatâs
inspired
so
many
lifelong
laughingstocks
.
hereâs
holden
fruitlessly
swimming
against
the
current
a
complete
nincompoop
letâs
remember
heâs
irish
who
gets
kicked
out
of
school
for
being
a
moron
and
talks
hard
yet
winds
up
getting
the
shit
mercilessly
beaten
out
of
him
by
a
crumby
snob
named
stradlater
a
book
about
studly
strad
would
have
been
far
better
and
a
pimp
named
maurice
.
holden
also
feels
the
need
to
denounce
everyone
as
a
phony
though
i
find
myself
at
a
loss
to
imagine
anything
phonier
than
a
wimpy
big-mouthed
mick
mollycoddled
by
daddyâs
fat
bankroll
while
attending
prep
school
along
with
his
stunning
array
of
hand-crafted
italian
leather
luggage
.
letâs
not
gloss
over
the
fact
that
holden
is
probably
impotent
as
evidenced
by
his
inability
to
lay
the
wood
to
sally
jane
or
even
a
prostitute
perhaps
his
crowning
disgrace
.
either
that
or
heâs
queer
seeing
as
he
duped
poor
antolini
by
presenting
his
former
mentor
with
the
ultimate
fantasy
of
a
drunken
sexually-inexperienced
youth
with
âno
place
to
goâ
and
then
afraid
that
further
action
might
expose
his
impotence
he
felt
the
need
to
flee
into
the
night
acting
all
startled
about
what
just
transpired
.
letâs
face
it
holden
himself
claims
that
similar
âpervertyâ
stuff
happened
to
him
a
lot
as
a
kid
and
then
feigns
shock
when
antolini
comes
in
to
take
a
juicy
bite
of
the
bare
bottom
he
so
masterfully
baited
.
all
this
weirdness
coming
from
an
awkward
geek
with
a
fondness
for
children
ought
to
be
enough
to
sway
any
who
remain
unconvinced
thus
far
.
youâre
still
not
seeing
the
light
seriously
ok
last
clue
caulfield
is
a
deviant
the
kid
aspires
to
be
a
âcatcherâ
.
and
this
âcatcherâ
fantasy
involves
children
.
if
you
need
further
explanation
iâll
be
required
to
rent
a
jackhammer
to
pound
the
obvious
into
your
skull
.
this
will
hopefully
be
the
last
time
that
i
read
âthe
catcher
in
the
ryeâ
as
iâve
given
it
too
many
chances
and
always
walked
away
completely
disappointed
.
i
will
give
salinger
's
opus
two
stars
however
simply
for
the
entertainment
of
laughing
at
it
.

see
my
review
.
when
you
understand
that
salinger
could
n't
say
what
he
knew
about
this
war
so
he
wrote
it
as
a
children
's
book
...
just
like
felix
salten
in
bambi
not
the
disney
version
which
is
probably
why
salinger
did
n't
get
his
published.salinger
tells
you
this
is
nit
a
david
copperfield
story
.
so
do
n't
read
it
like
it
is
about
holden
.
hint
look
at
the
first
page
of
david
copperfield
to
understand
``
caiulfields
''
name.i
hope
you
will
reread
it
again
.
this
time
when
you
get
to
the
merry
go
round
play
the
music
salinger
said
was
playing
and
see
if
that
makes
sense
or
if
he
is
using
this
book
to
tell
you
about
money
power
and
war

such

has

he

this

is
a
little
much

yeah
i
liked
it

i
'm
a

also
it

than
the
coveted

because
for

..you
ca
n't
really
love
the
catcher
in

if
you
are
feeling
happy
and
content
.
at
least
i
ca
n't
.
when
i
'm
happy
all
i
see
is
a
moody
overly
judgmental
privileged
teenager
looking
for
reasons
to
bitch
about
the
world
and
being
immature
and
a
phony
.
i
have
to
feel
some
discontent
to
appreciate
the
hiding
behind
that
facade
helpless
anger
pain
loss
and
a
rebellious
streak
.
holden
is
-
or
at
least
sometimes
unsuccessfully
trying
to
be
-
a
rebel
.
a
troublemaker
.
a
square
peg
in
a
round
hole
.
yes
i
am
very
aware
i
'm
quoting
the
apple
commercial
.
so
sue
me
.
maybe
it
's
off-topic
or
something
.
you
decide.and
right
now
i
am
not
happy
and
content
seeing
the
site
i
used
to
love
heading
down
the
road
that
is
perilous
at
best
.
the
road
that
clearly
shows
preference
towards
consumers
over
readers
.
the
consumerism
mantra
of
buy-buy-buy
is
taking
precedence
over
think-disagree-discuss-passionately
argue-watch
the
truth
being
born
.
holden
caulfield
would
not
approve
of
such
change
in
direction
.
and
neither
do
i
or
so
many
people
i
have
come
to
respect
people
whose
opinions
help
me
discover
the
works
of
literature
that
i
love.holden
caulfield
's
views
and
his
expression
of
them
were
admittedly
often
juvenile
poorly
thought-through
and
frequently
just
as
phony
as
those
of
people
he
reviles
.
he
was
quick
to
jump
to
judgment
ignoring
those
who
really
cared
for
him
.
he
was
prejudiced
snobbish
and
arrogant
and
a
habitual
liar
too
.
how
often
do
the
readers
want
to
reach
into
the
book
and
shake
some
sense
into
this
boy
spiraling
down
into
desperation
and
a
breakdownand
yet
there
is
something
about
the
unhappy
rebellious
teenager
that
still
resonates
with
us
despite
the
obvious
flaws
.
it
is
his
anger
itself
the
rage
against
the
world
that
is
fake
and
all
about
appearances
about
the
power
imbalance
about
the
smugness
the
powerful
of
this
world
carry
with
them
.
his
emotions
are
so
raw
and
so
sincere
that
i
may
disagree
with
some
of
them
but
i
sure
as
hell
ca
n't
ignore
them.as
we
probably
all
know
too
well
the
catcher
in
the
rye
has
been
one
of
the
most
challenged
books
of
the
20th
century
riling
up
the
emotions
and
protests
of
the
wannabe
censors
who
thought
it
was
their
sacred
duty
to
shield
and
protect
the
public
from
the
work
of
literature
that
dared
to
offend
their
tender
sensibilities
.
these
self-appointed
sensors
were
quite
ironically
if
you
think
about
it
trying
to
be
nothing
less
than
the
self-appointed
catchers
in
the
rye
protecting
our
childlike
innocence
from
falling
prey
to
the
catcher
in
the
rye
.
what
they
fail
to
grasp
is
that
the
point
of
the
book
itself
is
that
such
seemingly
noble
efforts
are
useless
worthless
and
quite
phony
in
their
presumptuousness
of
knowing
what
's
best
that
these
efforts
are
a
slippery
slope
that
is
futile
and
dangerous.just
as
it
is
equally
presumptuous
and
patronizing
and
dangerous
for
any
power
to
tell
book
readers
there
is
a
proper
way
to
express
their
opinions
that
they
need
to
stay
on
topic
or
else
there
will
be
a
delete-button
action
equal
to
the
shriek
of
'digression
'
gleefully
coming
from
holden
's
classmates
.
playing
self-appointed
catcher
in
the
rye
to
the
delicate
sensibilities
of
certain
bookselling
sites
entitled
writers
or
a
bunch
of
offended
fans
shifting
the
focus
from
discussing
literature
to
reviewing
product
and
collecting
data
-
all
this
is
just
as
misguided
as
holden
's
futile
efforts
of
saving
children
from
growing
up
.
you
see
this
is
what
i
love
about
salinger
's
so
often
contested
work
-
its
ability
to
stir
thoughts
and
opinions
that
go
beyond
the
plot
and
the
book
report
and
make
you
think
and
maybe
-just
maybe
-
be
a
touch
rebellious
too
.
this
is
dangerous
in
the
best
meaning
of
this
word
the
meaning
that
makes
all
the
self-appointed
censors
uneasy
.
these
censors
would
rather
have
everyone
toe
the
line
and
do
what
's
expected
and
never
have
to
face
anything
that
even
remotely
upsets
delicate
sensibilities
.
but
holden
caulfield
goes
on
being
subversive
.
and
occasionally
being
off
topic
-
and
that
's
perfectly
fine
by
me
.
``

this

about
a

when
you

he
wrote
it
as
a

just

in

not
the
disney
version
which
is
probably
why
salinger
did
n't
get
his
published.salinger
tells
you
this
is
nit
a

story
.
so
do
n't
read
it
like

hint
look
at
the
first
page
of
david

to

hope
you
will
reread
it
again

you
get
to

play
the
music
salinger
said
was
playing
and
see
if
that

i
think
holden
is
supposed
to
be
a
phony
.
i
think
that
's

of

's
he
's
so
oblivious
to
his
own

because
he
's

the
point
that
's
he
's
so
oblivious
to
his
own
problems
because
he
's
focused
on
everyone
else
.
in
a
way
holden
's
phoniness
is
part
of
his
obsession
with
innocence
and
allie
's
death
.
holden
gets
so
upset
over
jane
going
out
with
stradlater
and
the
real
reason
he
would
n't
sleep
with
the
prostitute
and
why
the
grafitti
in
the
museum
makes
him
so
mad
and
a
hundred
other
little
things
in
the
book
.
holden
wants
to
protect
the
innocence
of
everyone
around
him
and
he
's
mad
at
people
who
have
already
lost
theirs
and
he
's
mad
at
people
who
try
to
take
it
from
others
.
but
holden
himself
is
no
longer
innocent
and
if
he
's
honest
with
himself
then
that
means
he
has
to
deal
with
the
fact
that
he
does
n't
live
up
to
his
own
standards
.
however
if
holden
has
to
worry
about
fixing
himself
he
ca
n't
devote
his
time
to
protecting
pheobe
and
the
others
so
it
's
easier
for
holden
to
deny
his
own
problems
and
worry
about
everyone
else
.
holden
's
realization
at
the
end
with
the
carousel
and
allowing
pheobe
to
try
to
grab
the
ring
is
important
not
just
because
it
symbolizes
holden
letting
go
of
allie
or
realizing
that
he
ca
n't
protect
pheobe
forever
but
also
because
if
opens
the
door
for
holden
to
focus
on
himself

as
a
young
man
''
and
``
this
side
of
paradise
''
is
in
the
treatment
of
social
mores
.
where
these
other
novels
offer
a
one-dimensional
treatment
of
sexuality
and
religious
apostasy
as
the
sum-all
of
maturation
salinger
offers
a
more
complicated
more
realistic
picture
.
caulfield
's
narrative
certainly
deals
with
sexuality
but
he
goes
beyond
the
stock
material
of
young
man
bucking
sexual
conventions
.
after
first
boasting
about
past
sexual
encounters
caulfield
admits
he
's
actually
a
virgin
.
at
an
age
in
which
sexual
experience
is
a
badge
of
honor
for
most
young
men
caulfied
decides
that
sex
should
be
as
much
spiritual
as
physical
and
ought
to
be
shared
only
with
someone
he
really
cares
about
.
when
his
sexually
experienced
roommate
goes
out
with
an
innocent
childhood
friend
caulfield
throws
it
down
with
the
young
man
in
protest
against
the
perceived
assault
on
innocence
.
later
caulfield
accepts
a
prostitute
into
his
room
only
to
become
depressed
pay
the
girl
and
turn
her
out
without
accepting
her
services
.
the
following
day
caulfield
donates
10
to
two
humble
nuns
the
same
amount
paid
to
the
whore
the
night
before.salinger
's
treatment
of
religion
is
equally
nuanced
and
equally
honest
.
while
claiming
to
be
``
practically
an
atheist
''
caulfield
also
admits
that
he
has
a
desire
to
pray
.
while
disclaiming
a
belief
in
god
he
occasionally
asks
what
christ
would
think
about
people
's
actions
.
in
caulfield
's
conflict
the
reader
sees
a
certain
disgust
with
the
phoniness
of
organized
religion
set
against
a
sincere
acceptance
of
christ
's
actual
message.so
while
this
book
shares
with
other
novels
a
contempt
for
societal
mores
it
is
not
a
simple
repudiation
of
religion
in
favor
of
unrestrained
sexuality
.
caulfield
does
reject
most
of
the
adult
world
he
encounters
as
utterly
``
phony
''
but
he
does
not
follow
the
stock
pattern
laid
down
by
earlier
modernists
.
caulfield
questions
it
all
perhaps
despising
hollywood
above
everything
else.so
what
does
caulfield
accept
after
rejecting
all
of
adult
society
childhood
innocence
.
the
only
thing
that
makes
this
young
man
happy
is
spending
time
with
children
his
young
sister
most
of
all
.
indeed
the
section
giving
rise
to
the
title
of
the
work
is
a
poignant
plea
for
saving
innocent
children
from
the
phoniness
and
corruption
of
the
world.so
for
all
the
past
scandal
about
the
profanity
and
sexuality
in
this
work
there
is
much
to
be
admired
by
the
secularist
and
the
christian
alike
.
that
's
difficult
to
do
but
salinger
pulls
it
off
marvelously
.
though
we
ca
n't
all
agree
what
influences
in
society
are
corrupting
i
think
most
everyone
can
agree
that
there
is
initially
some
purity
that
is
corrupted
.

so

of

story
the
catcher
in
the
rye
is
instead
a
look
at
a
48-hour
block
in
the
life
of
an
american
teen
named
holden
caulfield
a
skinny
and
obnoxious
kid
who
comes
from
a
generally
comfortable
decent
family
on
the
east
coast
but
who
for
some
reason
just
seemingly
ca
n't
get
along
with
anyone
or
fit
in
anywhere
.
in
fact
as
the
novel
opens
holden
has
just
gotten
kicked
out
of
yet
another
private
prep
school
it
is
right
before
holiday
in
fact
with
his
family
expecting
him
home
in
two
days
anyway
so
he
's
decided
to
just
hoof
it
around
the
new
york
area
for
the
next
48
hours
and
spend
some
time
thinking
about
his
life.as
a
result
not
much
of
note
actually
happens
to
holden
over
the
next
two
days
--
he
visits
an
old
teacher
he
does
n't
like
very
much
invites
an
ex-girlfriend
he
does
n't
like
very
much
to
go
traveling
with
him
eventually
ends
up
in
manhattan
then
back
at
his
parents
'
place
and
then
finally
an
amusement
park
while
entertaining
his
little
sister
.
the
main
point
of
the
book
then
is
to
try
to
understand
holden
as
a
character
and
deeply
flawed
human
to
watch
the
way
he
looks
at
life
to
notice
the
way
he
idolizes
his
older
brother
out
in
hollywood
and
making
a
living
as
a
screenwriter
.
holden
is
both
restless
and
old-fashioned
tender
and
cruel
someone
who
is
sometimes
blurting
out
uncomfortable
truths
and
sometimes
lying
right
to
your
face
.
and
by
the
time
we
're
done
hopefully
we
've
learned
something
not
only
about
him
in
particular
but
about
teens
in
general
and
especially
the
sense
of
alienation
and
standoffishness
that
comes
to
so
many
at
that
age
no
matter
when
in
history
we
're
talking
about.the
argument
for
it
being
a
classicthe
argument
for
this
being
a
classic
is
a
clean
and
simple
one
--
it
is
demonstrably
the
very
first
book
in
history
to
establish
the
``
confessional
young
adult
''
genre
one
that
has
grown
in
our
modern
times
to
accommodate
tens
of
thousands
of
books
and
millions
of
grateful
teen
fans
.
before
catcher
in
the
rye
its
fans
say
there
were
only
two
types
of
stories
considered
appropriate
for
younger
readers
--
either
moralistic
tales
that
very
sternly
taught
right
from
wrong
or
the
kind
of
psuedo-science
babble
mysteries
like
i
was
mentioning
last
week
when
i
was
reviewing
20000
leagues
under
the
sea
.
salinger
was
the
very
first
person
to
publish
a
book
about
a
teen
written
from
the
teen
's
point
of
view
himself
a
very
raw
point
of
view
that
contains
sex
filth
cursing
galore
and
all
the
other
prurient
stuff
that
comes
with
peeking
inside
a
16-year-old
boy
's
head
it
was
a
breakthrough
of
the
modernist
era
fans
claim
one
of
those
seminal
projects
that
broke
the
ground
for
all
the
naturalistic
books
and
films
in
the
'50s
'60s
and
'70s
that
came
afterwards
.
oh
and
if
this
were
n't
enough
it
just
also
happens
to
be
the
most
censored
book
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
as
well
as
a
personal
favorite
of
both
mark
david
chapman
who
killed
john
lennon
and
john
hinckley
jr
who
shot
ronald
reagan
these
facts
alone
almost
guarantee
it
a
spot
on
any
list
of
classics.the
argument
againstthe
main
argument
against
this
being
a
classic
seems
to
be
that
it
's
become
a
victim
of
its
own
success
indeed
catcher
in
the
rye
has
been
so
influential
over
the
decades
its
critics
say
an
entire
genre
of
``
salingeresque
''
work
now
exists
which
like
i
said
is
more
formally
known
as
``
confessional
young
adult
''
many
books
of
which
are
actually
much
better
than
the
original
that
started
them
all
.
after
all
let
's
admit
it
catcher
in
the
rye
has
its
problems
ones
typical
of
any
young
and
inexperienced
writer
which
salinger
was
when
first
penning
this
just
as
one
good
example
there
are
only
so
many
times
you
can
use
the
word
'g-ddam
'
in
one
story
before
it
becomes
a
self-parodying
joke
.
like
many
of
the
books
being
reviewed
in
this
essay
series
i
do
n't
think
there
's
a
single
human
out
there
who
would
deny
this
novel
's
historical
importance
but
that
's
not
what
we
're
trying
to
determine
here
with
the
cclap
100
but
rather
whether
it
's
a
book
you
personally
should
read
before
you
die.my
verdictso
imagine
my
shock
when
i
found
myself
finishing
this
book
and
saying
to
myself
``
my
god
--
jd
salinger
is
basically
judy
blume
with
more
cursing
.
''
or
to
be
completely
fair
i
guess
that
should
be
worded
--
``
my
god
judy
blume
is
basically
jd
salinger
with
jews
and
menstruation
.
''
i
guess
i
had
been
expecting
a
lot
more
given
what
a
supernaturally
high
regard
this
book
has
among
such
a
large
swath
of
the
general
population
i
was
expecting
it
to
not
only
be
a
good
young
adult
novel
which
it
admittedly
is
but
also
something
that
was
going
to
reveal
some
sort
of
transcendent
truth
about
the
world
to
me
as
a
fully-grown
adult.er
...
it
does
n't
.
this
is
just
a
good
young
adult
novel
and
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
know
that
going
into
it
that
unless
you
're
a
teen
yourself
when
you
read
it
there
really
is
n't
going
to
be
anything
too
terribly
original
or
groundbreaking
found
in
this
manuscript
.
in
fact
you
could
argue
that
salinger
was
quite
smart
to
basically
wall
himself
off
from
the
press
and
general
public
after
this
book
and
never
publish
again
he
's
still
alive
by
the
way
for
those
who
do
n't
know
reputedly
living
a
happy
and
quiet
life
somewhere
on
the
atlantic
seaboard
because
ultimately
this
is
not
a
great
book
but
simply
a
good
one
eventually
made
legendary
because
of
the
time
period
it
was
published
and
the
subsequent
reclusive
career
that
salinger
has
had
.
its
overwhelming
historical
significance
i
think
earns
it
a
place
on
the
classics
list
plus
the
fact
that
it
's
not
actually
a
bad
book
at
all
it
's
just
that
this
is
a
kind
of
book
that
adults
have
already
read
many
times
before
especially
if
you
were
a
fan
of
such
authors
as
betsy
byars
when
you
were
a
teen
yourself
.
is
it
a
classic
i
suppose

and
cherish
like
treasure
only
if
you
care
to
lay
off
the
preordained
feelings
and
biases.sure
i
agree
nothing
ever
happens
in
this
book
.
the
prose
in
holden
's
own
overused
words
can
be
described
as
'boring
'
and
insipid
in
my
own
.
but
that
is
what
salinger
had
wanted
it
to
be.i
'm
pretty
sure
i
would
n't
have
liked
holden
had
i
read
this
as
a
teen
.
i
would
've
considered
him
a
whiny
nitpicking
pain
in
the
rear
.
a
kid
trying
to
sound
and
behave
like
an
adult
and
of
course
failing
at
it
miserably
.
but
now
that
i
'm
a
full-fledged
adult
capable
of
knowing
what
i
want
and
what
i
do
n't
i
can
understand
holden
much
better
.
and
i
ca
n't
help
but
feel
a
sort
of
grudging
respect
for
holden
's
daring
act
of
breaking
away
even
if
for
a
little
while
from
the
compulsions
and
responsibilities
that
life
threw
his
way
the
expectations
of
peers
and
adults
surrounding
him.his
voice
is
so
full
of
recalcitrance
loneliness
resentment
and
all
the
amorphous
emotions
of
that
age
that
it
's
near
impossible
not
to
relate
to
it
.
a
sense
of
pure
isolation
a
feeling
of
being
adrift
in
the
big
bad
world
sometimes
with
barely
anything
or
anyone
acting
as
an
anchor
.
faced
with
problems
you
previously
did
not
even
know
existed
an
ever-widening
gap
with
the
members
of
the
opposite
sex
.
a
mass
of
confusing
blurry
thoughts
swirling
inside
your
head
that
you
would
rather
prefer
to
push
away
than
disentangle
one
by
one
and
analyze
.
sometimes
not
being
sure
of
what
you
want
to
do
and
what
you
are
supposed
to
do
.
stuck
somewhere
in
a
time-warp
on
the
brink
of
adulthood
yet
not
quite
so
.
demanding
to
be
treated
with
respect
and
dignity
like
an
adult
yet
to
be
loved
as
a
child
.
i
'm
sure
we
have
all
gone
through
the
same
motions
at
some
point
of
time
in
our
lives.holden
reminds
us
of
that
period
even
if
we
may
not
see
in
him
the
teenager
each
one
of
us
had
been
individually
.
he
is
simply
a
personification
of
those
confusing
bitter
hazy
years
that
precede
the
surer
firmer
more
secure
years.and
if
we
maybe
honest
enough
with
ourselves
we
'll
find
a
holden
all
holed
up
somewhere
in
the
darkest
recesses
of
our
psyche
eternally
disdainful
and
critical
of
the
people
and
things
around
him
.
it
's
just
that
we
've
gotten
better
at
keeping
'him
'
hidden
and
swallowing
urges
to
lash
out
at
the
'phoniness
'
of
it
all
.
holden
's
appeal
is
timeless
.
and
i
'm
quite
sure
i
'll
like
this
book
when
i
read
it
again
years
down
the
line
.
and
for
this
reason
alone
the
catcher
in
the
rye
rightly
deserves
a
place
in
the
halls
of
classic
american
literature.this
is
the
ya
novel
.
and
perhaps
will
always
be
.
p.s-
my
love
for
this
book
is
not
to
be
interpreted
as
an
endorsement
of
teenage
delinquency
or
rebelliousanti-social
behavior
.

this
book
is
the
epitome
of
depression-filled
angsty
gobbledygook
that
high
schools
shove
down
teenagers
throats
in
an
effort
to
make
them
think
deep
thoughts
-
or
to
attempt
to
relate
to
them
somehow
.
it
's
true
that
there
were
many
times
that
i
felt
depressed
and
alienated
in
high
school
.
somehow
reading
about
it
in
literature
did
nothing
for
any
sort
of
need
for
me
.
maybe
it
does
for
some
people
but
i
think
it
was
bad
enough
dealing
with
it
in
reality
than
reading
some
dismal
thing
and
exploring
its
dark
depths
of
depravity.i
really
do
n't
know
why
they
advertise
such
emotionally
unstable
stuff
to
a
group
of
people
with
raging
hormones
anyway
.
i
'm
not
saying
to
ban
it
.
people
should
be
able
to
read
what
they
want
.
i
just
do
n't
think
it
should
be
required
reading
.
it
seems
to
be
fuel
for
more
depression.i
mean
this
in
sardonic
facetiousness
it
's
not
the
swearing
dialogue
or
the
character
's
behavior
that
makes
it
so
inappropriate
.
it
's
the
fact
that
one
might
want
to
slash
their
wrists
after
this
read
.
we
always
talked
about
how
we
're
supposed
to
talk
about
and
reflect
how
literature
affects
us
in
school
.
then
we
wonder
why
a
huge
percentage
of
people
are
pumped
up
on
prozac
and
other
happy
pills

i
think
if
this
book
makes
you
sad
then
you
're
reading
it
wrong
.
sure
holden
's
angsty
and
mean
but
nothing
bad
happens
to
him
.
in
fact
the
events
o
i
think
if
this
book
makes
you
sad
then
you
're
reading
it
wrong
.
sure
holden
's
angsty
and
mean
but
nothing
bad
happens
to
him
.
in
fact
the
events
of
catcher
in
the
rye
are
nothing
but
positive
for
holden
caulfield
because
he
grows
.
this
book
does
n't
show
teenagers
that
this
anger
that
holden
holds
is
valid
and
normal
in
fact
it
shows
the
opposite
that
whatever
is
bringing
you
down
can
be
overcome
.
the
majority
of
book
holden
's
behavior
is
guided
by
his
obsession
with
genuineness
and
his
obsession
with
innocence
.
both
of
these
ideas
stem
from
the
death
of
his
brother
allie
.
holden
feels
at
least
in
part
guiltythough
he
has
no
reason
to
over
the
death
of
his
brother
and
one
of
the
main
characteristics
of
his
brother
that
he
focuses
on
is
innocence
.
holden
ca
n't
project
allie
's
red
hair
on
everyone
he
cares
about
though
holden
's
love
for
his
red
hat
may
stem
from
this
connection
but
he
can
project
his
innocence
which
is
why
holden
wants
so
badly
to
protect
pheobe
and
jane
.
at
the
end
of
the
book
holden
realizes
that
he
ca
n't
protect
them
forever
symbolized
by
him
letting
pheobe
ride
the
carousel
.
however
the
greater
point
in
this
is
that
holden
is
letting
go
of
allie
.
he
accepts
that
pheobe
has
to
grow
up
even
though
allie
never
got
to
.
he
gives
up
his
red
hat
.
at
the
end
of
the
book
holden
moves
on.though
i
do
n't
think
most
teenagers
have
lost
a
younger
brother
most
people
regardless
of
their
age
have
something
hanging
over
their
head
that
guides
their
actions
in
a
negative
way
whether
the
realize
it
or
not
.
the
catcher
in
the
rye
is
the
story
of
holden
letting
go
of
this
negative
influence
and
it
should
inspire
and
guide
other
people
to
do
the
same
.
holden
may
be
a
teenager
but
this
book
is
n't
just
about
teenagers
.
it
's
about
everyone
whose
ever
had
trouble
letting
go
of
something
in
their
past
and
this
book
is
liberating
not
depressing
.

took
me
a
week
and
half
to
read
this
book
because
i
wanted
to
savor
it
.
what
a
powerful
story
teller
if
only
he
'd
learn
how
to
break
a
few
paragraphs
every
once
in
awhile
.
love
or
hate
holden
you
get
holden
.
that
moment
when
he
held
the
snowball
and
looked
out
over
the
snowy
street
below
unable
to
throw
the
snowball
because
it
looked
too
pretty
was
such
a
fabulous
example
of
showing
us
holden
's
personality
and
his
insecurities
about
himself
in
the
world
that
it
made
me
smile
.
so
much
of
his
quirky
personality
word
choice
exaggerations
and
the
way
j.d
.
salinger
writes
it
with
such
power
and
metaphor
made
me
smile
well
minus
the
use
of
about
the
only
swear
words
that
makes
me
cringe.i
have
a
weakness
for
good
boy
protagonists
.
girls
get
whiny
and
annoying
but
boys
bottle
it
up
so
you
want
to
protect
them
.
i
found
the
scene
where
holden
fights
with
his
roommate
for
saying
he
messed
around
with
a
girl
he
liked
so
powerful
.
you
can
feel
the
emotion
breathing
off
holden
and
know
exactly
what
he
's
thinking
despite
what
he
says
.
for
all
his
angst
salinger
gives
us
enough
of
his
emotional
breakdowns
and
his
show
of
good
heart
that
you
feel
for
him
even
if
you
want
to
shake
him
.
dealing
with
his
brother
's
death
and
his
insecurities
about
living
up
to
his
family
he
's
falling
apart
but
even
those
who
see
that
he
needs
do
n't
get
that
his
alienation
and
apathy
are
self
preservation
.
i
ca
n't
help
but
think
that
he
wanted
to
protect
kids
so
much
because
he
needed
someone
protecting
him
.
he
's
such
a
child
his
whole
character
full
of
irony
.
he
needs
his
own
catcher
in
the
rye
standing
on
the
edge
of
that
cliff
to
make
sure
he
does
n't
fall
.

salinger
's
crap-fest.my
reasoning
for
such
a
poor
rating
is
simple
catcher
in
the
rye
has
no
beginning
middle
or
end
.
instead
of
a
story
it
is
a
clumsy
glimpse
into
the
worthless
life
of
the
apathetic
main
character
holden
caulfield
who
leaves
no
mark
and
accomplishes
nothing
of
value.i
ca
n't
believe
it
when
anyone
says
that
they
sympathize
with
caulfield
.
that
he
``
speaks
the
things
which
they
ca
n't
''
.
every
time
i
hear
someone
gushing
about
catcher
in
the
rye
and
it
's
nonsensical
ramblings
a
little
part
of
me
dies
.
every
time
someone
finishes
this
book
and
puts
it
down
thoughtfully
tilting
their
head
in
mock
understanding
as
they
furrow
their
childish
brows
satan
laughs
and
high
fives
j.d
.
salinger
amidst
hell
's
furious
flames.when
catcher
in
the
rye
is
read
aloud
backwards
from
finish
to
start
it
opens
up
an
extra-dimensional
portal
where
lovecraftian
horrors
spew
endlessly
into
our
peaceful
world
.
when
it
's
read
aloud
forwards
from
start
to
finish
people
fall
asleep
from
boredom.your
evil
twin
loves
catcher
in
the
rye
and
twirls
his
or
her
's
nefarious
pencil
thin
mustache
while
reading
it

they
laugh
their
evil
doppleganger
laugh
while
thinking
of
evil
ways

life
thanks
to
j.d

salinger.in
his
early
days
salinger
pulled
a
thorn
out
of
a
witch
's
foot
who
granted
him
a
wish
which
was
to
write
the
great
american
novel
.
unfortunately
the
witch
's
foul
magicks
were
encapsulated
in
the
book
catcher
in
the
rye
and
salinger
hung
himself
in
shame
immediately
after
it
's
publishing.i
could
literally
go
on
and
on
for
days
like
this
.
this
book
is
awful
and

you

it
you
're
a
putz.i
'm
sorry

it

how

holden
is
an
annoying
narrator
.
he
vascilates
from
one
opinion
to
the
opposite
in
the
span
of
a
page
he
rambles
on
often
he
's
got
a
low
tolerance
threshhold
and
there
are
times
he
's
just
an
ass
.
but
er
that
's
the
point
.
if
you
do
n't
like
holden
salinger
did
his
job.on
the
same
token
i
find
it
hard
to
hate
holden
because
i
see
bits
of
me
in
him
.
less
now
than
when
i
look
back
on
when
i
was
his
age
but
i
think
most
teens
should
be
able
to
relate
to
holden
especially
male
teens
.
if
you
ca
n't
you
're
either
incredibly
well
adjusted
and
if
that
's
the
case
you
lucked
out
or
you
're
the
sort
of
person
that
drives
someone
to
become
holden
jaded
by
everything
before
graduating
high
school
convinced
everyone
is
phony
...
not
that
holden
himself
is
n't
phony
at
times
but
every
teen
is
.
the
book
is
n't
about
events
.
the
events
are
commonplace
.
they
're
supposed
to
be
.
it
's
about
the
character
and
what
he
says
and
to
extrapolate
what
it
means
.
you
could
say
it
's
cautionary
that
salinger
is
laughing
at
the
spoiled
rich
brat
he
's
writing
holden
as
and
that
we
the
reader
should
take
it
as
warning
not
to
become
him
.
we
could
see
it
as
dystopian
that
salinger
was
commenting
on
the
shallowness
of
american
culture
through
the
eyes
of
a
child
one
well-off
enough
to
both
see
its
most
glaring
pettiness
as
well
as
partake
in
it
's
seedier
aspects
.
you
could
even
see
it
as
a
bit
of
a
commentary
about
what
really
matters
...
about
how
even
the
most
cynical
teen
out
there
still
has
something
they
love
in
holden
's
case
family
.
you
could
even
take
that
a
step
further
and
see
it
psychologically
...
what
damage
a
loss
like
that
of
allie
could
cause
in
a
young
mind
etc
.
there
's
a
lot
to
look
into
in
the
catcher
in
the
rye
...
even
the
admittedly
weak
explaination
of
the
title
could
spark
discussion
as
to
what
it
says
about
or
means
in
terms
of
his
character
.
these
are
just
the
impressions
i
get
from
it
...
hardly
researched
but
then
the
best
book
discussions
should
n't
come
from
research
but
from
your
heart
.
i
just
think
that
with
many
classics
people
start
looking
for
something
huge
...
a
big
rollicking
plot
some
amazing
humour
or
poetic
language
and
sometimes
the
brilliance
of
a
book
is
so
much
more
subtle
.
not
that
holden
ca
n't
turn
a
phrase
and
certainly
not
to
say
that
there
are
times
when
holden
's
sheer
contradictory
nature
jumps
the
line
into
humorous
and
not
even
to
say
there
are
n't
some
big
and
poignant
moments
in
the
mundanity
word
of
the
plot
...
simply
that
in
a
book
like
this
even
those
moneymaker
bits
are
understated
.

however
as
i
think
is
clear
to
you
given
your
reading
every
text
can
tell
multiple
stories
.
this
is
the
beauty
of
reading
is
it
not
for
a
couple
totally
relevant
examples
consider
the
original
intentions
of
baum
's
oz
or
carroll
's
alice
both
had
very
specific
very
dull
and
very
forgotten
purposes
yet
both
texts
endure
due
to
the
surface
pleasures
and
the
more
tangible
universal
lessons.as
such
no
matter
how
intentionally
or
cleanly
a
wwii
narrative
fits
the
story
and
i
certainly
do
n't
doubt
it
could
be
the
case
or
that
you
have
evidence
for
it
holden
himself
must
have
a
purpose
and
his
persona
must
have
a
purpose
.
no
matter
what
other
layers
exist
catcher
in
the
rye
is
about
holden
.
it
can
also
be
about
other
things
but
it
is
the
story
of
holden
which
would
paint
these
other
aspects
.
holden
would
be
the
lens
through
which
wwii
was
seen
in
your
example
.
to
get
at
what
salinger
is
saying
whether
it
is
commentary
on
a
wayward
culture
or
allegory
for
the
horror
and
aftermath
of
the
war
one
needs
to
understand
holden
