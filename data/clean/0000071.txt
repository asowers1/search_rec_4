adult
obsession
with
girl-children

the
ages
9
and
14
or

he
indulges
in
his
sexual
fantasies
by
pretending
to
read
a
book
in
a
public
park
and
being
aroused
by
nymphets
playing
near
him
as
well
as
by
visiting
a
prostitute
who
he
believes
to
be
16
or
17
and
imagining
her
to
be
three
years
younger
.
after
a
close
call
with
the
police
when
he
requested
a
nymphet-aged
girl
from
a
pimp
humbert
marries
an
adult
woman
with
childish
mannerisms
valeria
for
safety
.
his

and
after
another
visit
to
a
psychiatric
ward
after
a
mental
breakdown
he
moves
to
the
small
new
england
town
of
ramsdale
to
write
.
humbert
fantasizes
about
meeting
and
eventually
fondling
the
12-year-old
daughter
of
an
impoverished
family
from

he
agreed

rent
buying
an
expensive
bag
of
toys
before
meeting
the
mccoo
family
only
to
find
that

house
burned
down
.
a
``
mrs.

''
offers
to
accommodate
him
instead
and
humbert
visits
her
residence
reluctantly
out
of
politeness
as
``
the
only
reason
for
his
coming
at
all
to
ramsdale
had
vanished
.
''
he
plans
to
decline
the
widowed
charlotte
haze
's
offer
until
she
at
last
shows
him
her
garden
and
12-year-old
daughter
dolores
born
19351
known
as
``
lo
''
``
lola
''
or
``
dolly
''
.
he
immediately
becomes
infatuated
with
her
citing
her
uncanny
resemblance
to
annabel
and
agrees
to
stay
at
charlotte
's
house
only
to
be
near
her
daughter
whom
he
privately
nicknames
``
lolita
''
.
while
``
lolita
''
is
away
at
summer
camp
charlotte
who
has
fallen
in
love
with
humbert
tells
him
in
a
letter
that
he
must
either
marry
her
or
move
out
to
avoid
embarrassment
.
humbert
agrees
to
marry
charlotte
in
order
to
continue
living
near
lolita
.
charlotte
is
oblivious
to
humbert
's
distaste
for
her
as
well
as
his
lust
for
lolita
until
she
reads
his
diary
.
learning
of
humbert
's
true
feelings
and
intentions
charlotte
plans
to
flee
and
send
lolita
to
a
reform
school
threatening
to
expose
humbert
as
a
``
detestable
abominable
criminal
fraud
.
''
however
fate
intervenes
on
humbert
's
behalf
as
she
runs
across
the
street
in
a
state
of
shock
charlotte
is
struck
and
killed
by
a
passing
car
.
humbert
retrieves
lolita
from
camp
pretending
that
charlotte
has
been
hospitalized
.
rather
than
return
to
charlotte
's
home
humbert
takes
lolita
to
a
hotel
.
humbert
plans
to
use
one
sleeping
pill
out
of
a
total
of
forty
per
night
to
drug
lolita
and
perform
sexual
intercourse
on
her
while
she
is
unconscious
.
as
he
waits
for
the
first
pill
to
take
effect
he
wanders
through
the
hotel
and
meets
a
man
who
seems
to
know
him
.
humbert
excuses
himself
from
the
strange
conversation
and
returns
to
the
hotel
room
.
there
he
tries
molesting
lolita
but
finds
that
the
sedative
is
too
mild
.
instead
she
initiates
sex
the
next
morning
after
explaining
that
she
had
slept
with
a
boy
at
camp
.
later
humbert
reveals
to
lolita
that
charlotte
is
dead
giving
her
no
choice
but
to
accept
her
stepfather
into
her
life
on
his
terms
or
face
foster
care
.
lolita
and
humbert
drive
around
the
country
moving
from
state
to
state
and
motel
to
motel
.
in
order
to
keep
lolita
from
going
to
the
police
humbert
tells
her
if
he
is
arrested
she
will
become
a
ward
of
the
state
and
lose
all
her
clothes
and
belongings
.
he
also
bribes
her
with
food
money
or
permission
to
attend
fun
events
for
sexual
favors
though
he
knows
that
she
does
not
reciprocate
his
love
and
shares
none
of
his
interests
.
after
a
year
touring
north
america
the
two
settle
down
in
another
new
england
town
where
lolita
is
enrolled
in
a
girls
'
school
.
humbert
becomes
very
possessive
and
strict
forbidding
lolita
to
take
part
in
after-school
activities
or
to
associate
with
boys
.
most
of
the
townspeople
see
this
as
the
action
of
a
loving
and
concerned
though
old-fashioned
parent
.
lolita
begs
to
be
allowed
to
take
part
in
the
school
play
and
humbert
reluctantly
grants
his
permission
in
exchange
for
more
sexual
favors
.
the
play
is
written
by
mr.
clare
quilty
.
quilty
is
said
to
have
attended
a
rehearsal
and
been
impressed
by
lolita
's
acting
.
just
before
opening
night
lolita
and
humbert
have
a
ferocious
argument
and
lolita
runs
away
while
humbert
assures
the
neighbors
everything
is
fine
.
he
searches
frantically
until
he
finds
her
exiting
a
phone
booth
.
she
is
in
a
bright
pleasant
mood
saying
that
she
tried
to
reach
him
at
home
and
that
a
``
great
decision
has
been
made
.
''
they
go
to
buy
drinks
and
lolita
tells
humbert
she
does
n't
care
about
the
play
and
wants
to
resume
their
travels
.
as
lolita
and
humbert
drive
westward
again
humbert
gets
the
feeling
that
their
car
is
being
tailed
and
becomes
increasingly
paranoid
suspecting
that
lolita
is
conspiring
with
others
in
order
to
escape
.
she
falls
ill
and
must
convalesce
in
a
hospital
while
humbert
stays
in
a
nearby
motel
without
lolita
for
the
first
time
in
years
.
one
night
lolita
disappears
from
the
hospital
with
the
staff
telling
humbert
that
her
``
uncle
''
checked
her
out
.
humbert
embarks
upon
a
frantic
search
to
find
lolita
and
her
abductor
but
eventually
gives
up
.
during
this
time
humbert
has
a
two-year
relationship
ending
in
1952
with
a
woman
named
rita
whom
he
describes
as
a
``
kind
good
sport
''
who
``
solemnly
approves
''
of
his
search
for
lolita
while
knowing
none
of
the
details
.
humbert
receives
a
letter
from
lolita
now
17
who
tells
him
that
she
is
married
making
her
name
now
dolores
schiller
pregnant
and
in
desperate
need
of
money
.
humbert
goes
to
see
lolita
giving
her
money
in
exchange
for
the
name
of
the
man
who
abducted
her
.
she
reveals
the
truth
clare
quilty
checked
her
out
of
the
hospital
after
following
them
throughout
their
travels
and
tried
to
make
her
star
in
one
of
his
pornographic
films
.
when
she
refused
he
threw
her
out
.
she
worked
odd
jobs
before
meeting
and
marrying
her
husband
who
knows
nothing
about
her
past
.
humbert
asks
lolita
to
leave
her
husband
dick
and
live
with
him
which
she
refuses
to
do
.
he
gives
her
a
large
sum
of
money
anyway
.
as
he
leaves
she
smiles
and
shouts
goodbye
in
a
``
sweet
american
''
way
.
humbert
finds
quilty
whom
he
intends
to
kill
at
his
mansion
.
before
doing
so
he
first
wants
quilty
to
understand
why
he
must
die
for
he
took
advantage
of
humbert
a
sinner
and
he
took
advantage
of
a
disadvantage
.
eventually
humbert
shoots
him
dead
and
exits
the
house
.
shortly
afterward
he
is
arrested
for
driving
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
road
and
swerving
.
the
narrative
closes
with
humbert
's
final
words
to
lolita
in
which
he
wishes
her
well
and
reveals
the
novel
in
its
metafiction
to
be
the
memoirs
of
his
life
only
to
be
published
after
he
and
lolita
have
both
died
.
erotic
motifs
and
controversyedit
lolita
is
frequently
described
as
an
``
erotic
novel
''
both
by
some
critics
but
also
in
a
standard
reference
work
on
literature
facts
on
file
companion
to
the
american
short
story.2
the
great
soviet
encyclopedia
called
lolita
``
an
experiment
in
combining
an
erotic
novel
with
an
instructive
novel
of
manners
.
``
3
the
same
description
of
the
novel
is
found
in
desmond
morris
's
reference
work
the
book
of
ages.4
a
survey
of
books
for
women
's
studies
courses
describes
it
as
a
``
tongue-in-cheek
erotic
novel
''
.5
books

on
the
history
of
erotic
literature
such
as
michael
perkins
'
the

modern
erotic
literature
also
so
classify
lolita.6
more
cautious
classifications
have
included
a
``
novel
with
erotic
motifs
''
7
or
one
of
``
a
number
of
works
of
classical
erotic
literature
and
art
and
to
novels
that

elements
of
eroticism

...
ulysses
and
lady
chatterley
's
lover
''
.8
however
this
classification
has
been
disputed
.
malcolm
bradbury
writes
``
at
first
famous
as
an
erotic
novel
lolita
soon
won
its
way
as
a
literary
oneâa
late
modernist
distillation
of

whole
crucial
mythology
.
``
9
samuel
schuman
says
that
nabokov
``
is
a
surrealist
linked
to
gogol
dostoyevsky
and
kafka
.
lolita
is
characterized
by
irony
and
sarcasm
.
it
is
not
an
erotic
novel
''
.10
lance
olsen
writes
``
the
first
13
chapters
of
the
text
culminating
with
the
oft-cited
scene
of
lo
unwittingly
stretching
her
legs
across
humbert
's
excited
lap
...
are
the
only
chapters
suggestive
of
the
erotic
.
``
11
nabokov
himself
observes
in
the
novel
's
afterword
that
a
few
readers
were
``
misled
.
by
the
opening
of
the
book
...
into
assuming
this
was
going
to
be
a
lewd
book
...
expecting
the
rising
succession
of
erotic
scenes
when
these
stopped
the
readers
stopped
too
and
felt
bored
.
``
12
style
and
interpretationedit
the
novel
is
a
tragicomedy
narrated
by
humbert
who
riddles
the
narrative
with
word
play
and
his
wry
observations
of
american
culture
.
his
humor
provides
an
effective
counterpoint
to
the
pathos
of
the
tragic
plot
.
the
novel
's
flamboyant
style
is
characterized
by
double
entendres
multilingual
puns
anagrams
and
coinages
such
as
nymphet
a
word
that
has
since
had
a
life
of
its
own
and
can
be
found
in
most
dictionaries
and
the
lesser-used
``
faunlet
''
.
one
of
the
novel
's
characters
``
vivian
darkbloom
''
is
an
anagram
of
the
author
's
name
.
several
times
the
narrator
begs
the
reader
to
understand
that
he
is
not
proud
of
his
rape
of
lolita
and
is
filled
with
remorse
.
at
one
point
he
listens
to
the
sounds
of
children
playing
outdoors
and
is
stricken
with
guilt
at
the
realization
that
he
robbed
lolita
of
her
childhood
.
when
he
is
reunited
with
the
17-year-old
lolita
he
realises
that
he
still
loves
her
even
though
she
no
longer
is
the
nymphet
of
his
dreams
.
most
writers
see
humbert
as
an
unreliable
narrator
and
credit
nabokov
's
powers
as
an
ironist
.
for
richard
rorty
in
his
interpretation
of
lolita
in
contingency
irony
and
solidarity
humbert
is
a
``
monster
of
incuriosity
.
''
nabokov
himself
described
humbert
as
``
a
vain
and
cruel
wretch
''
and
``
a
hateful
person
.
``
13
critics
have
further
noted
that
since
the
novel
is
a
first
person
narrative
by
humbert
the
novel
gives
very
little
information
about
what
lolita
is
personally
like
that
in
effect
she
has
been
silenced
by
not
being
the
book
's
narrator
.
nomi
tamir-ghez
writes
``
not
only
is
lolita
's
voice
silenced
her
point
of
view
the
way
she
sees
the
situation
and
feels
about
it
is
rarely
mentioned
and
can
be
only
surmised
by
the
reader
...
since
it
is
humbert
who
tells
the
story
...
throughout
most
of
the
novel
the
reader
is
absorbed
in
humbert
's
feelings
''
.14
similarly
mica
howe
and
sarah
appleton
aguiar
write
that
the
novel
silences
and
objectifies
lolita.15
christine
clegg
notes
that
this
is
a
recurring
theme
in
criticism
of
the
novel
in
the
1990s.16
actor
brian
cox
who
played
humbert
in
a
2009
one-man
stage
monologue
based
on
the
novel
stated
that
the
novel
is
``
not
about
lolita
as
a
flesh
and
blood
entity
.
it
's
lolita
as
a
memory
''
.
he
concluded
that
a
stage
monologue
would
be
truer
to
the
book
than
any
film
could
possibly
be.17
elizabeth
janeway
writing
in
the
new
york
review
of
books
holds
``
humbert
is
every
man
who
is
driven
by
desire
wanting
his
lolita
so
badly
that
it
never
occurs
to
him
to
consider
her
as
a
human
being
or
as
anything
but
a
dream-figment
made
flesh
''
.18
clegg
sees
the
novel
's
non-disclosure
of
lolita
's
feelings
as
directly
linked
to
the
fact
that
her
``
real
''
name
is
dolores
and
in
the
novel
but
not
the
film
only
humbert

iranian
expatriate

published
the
memoir

in
tehran
about
a
covert
women
's
reading
group
.
in
an
npr
interview
nafasi
contrasts
the
sorrowful
and
seductive
sides
of
doloreslolita
's
character
.
she
notes
``
because
her
name
is
not
lolita
her
real
name
is
dolores
which
as
you
know
in
latin
means
dolour
so
her
real
name
is
associated
with
sorrow
and
with
anguish
and
with
innocence
while
lolita
becomes
a
sort
of
light-headed
seductive
and
airy
name
.
the
lolita
of
our
novel
is
both
of
these
at
the
same
time
and
in
our
culture
here
today
we
only
associate
it
with
one
aspect
of
that
little
girl
and
the
crassest
interpretation
of
her
.
''
following
nafasi
's
comments
the
npr
interviewer
madeleine
brand
lists
as
embodiments
of
the
latter
side
of
lolita
``
the
long
island
lolita
britney
spears
the
olsen
twins
and
sue
lyon
in
stanley
kubrick

''
.22
for
nafisi
the
essence
of
the
novel
is
humbert
's
solipsism
and
his
erasure
of
lolita
's
independent
identity
.
she
writes
``
lolita
was
given
to
us
as
humbert
's
creature
...
to
reinvent
her
humbert
must
take
from
lolita
her
own
real
history
and
replace
it
with
his
own
...
yet
she
does
have
a
past
.
despite
humbert
's
attempts
to
orphan
lolita
by
robbing
her
of
her
history
that
past
is
still
given
to
us
in
glimpses

``
23
one
of
the
novel
's
early
champions
lionel
trilling
warned
in
1958
of
the
moral
difficulty
in
interpreting
a
book
with
so
eloquent
and
so
self-deceived
a
narrator
``
we
find
ourselves
the
more
shocked
when
we
realize
that
in
the
course
of
reading
the
novel
we
have
come
virtually
to
condone
the
violation
it
presents
...
we
have
been
seduced
into
conniving
in
the
violation
because
we
have
permitted
our
fantasies
to
accept
what
we
know
to
be
revolting
.
``
24
a
minority
of
critics
have
accepted
humbert
's
version
of
events
at
face
value
.
in
1959
novelist
robertson
davies
excused
the
narrator
entirely
writing
that
the
theme
of
lolita
is
``
not
the
corruption
of
an
innocent
child
by
a
cunning
adult
but
the
exploitation
of
a
weak
adult
by
a
corrupt
child
.
this
is
no
pretty
theme
but
it
is
one
with
which
social
workers
magistrates
and
psychiatrists
are
familiar
.
``
25
in
his
essay
on
stalinism
koba
the
dread
martin
amis
proposes
that
lolita
is
an
elaborate
metaphor
for
the
totalitarianism
that
destroyed
the
russia
of
nabokov
's
childhood
though
nabokov
states
in
his
afterword
that
he
``
detests
symbols
and
allegories
''
.
amis
interprets
it
as
a
story
of
tyranny
told
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
tyrant
.
``
nabokov
in
all
his
fiction
writes
with
incomparable
penetration
about
delusion
and
coercion
about
cruelty

lies

he
says

``
even

nabokov
finished

five

because
of
its

nabokov
intended
to

pseudonymously

the
anagrammatic

despite
warnings
from

nabokov
signed
a

was
published
in

as

eventually
at

1955
graham
greene
in
the
london
sunday
times
called
it
one
of
the
three

this
statement
provoked
a
response
from
the
london
sunday

whose
editor
john

called
it
``
the
filthiest

in

france
followed
suit

the
ban
lasted
for
two
years
.
its
eventual
british
publication
by
weidenfeld
nicolson
in
london
in

caused
a
scandal
that
contributed
to
the
end
of
the
political

nigel
nicolson.36
the

became
the

to

the
novel
continues
to
generate
controversy
today
as
modern
society
has
become
increasingly
aware
of
the
lasting
damage
created
by
child
sexual
abuse
.
in
2008
an
entire
book
was
published
on
the
best
ways
to
teach
the
novel
in
a
college
classroom
given
that
``
its
particular
mix
of

complicates
its
presentation

``
40
in
this

one
author
urges
teachers
to
note
that
lolita
's
suffering
is
noted
in
the
book
even
if
the
main
focus
is
on
humbert
.
many
critics
describe
humbert
as
a
rapist
notably
azar
nafisi
in
her
best-selling
reading
lolita
in
tehran41
though
in
a
survey
of
critics
david
larmour
notes
that
other
interpreters
of
the
novel
have
been
reluctant
to
use
that
term.42
near
the
end
of
the
novel
humbert
accuses
himself
of
rape
however
after
noting
this
nabokov
biographer
brian
boyd
tries
to
let
humbert
off
the
hook
on
the
grounds
that
dolores
was
not
a
virgin
and
seduced
humbert
in
the
morning
of
their
hotel
stay.43
this
perspective
is
vigorously
disputed
by
peter
rabinowitz
in
his
essay
``
lolita

sodomized

today
lolita
is
considered
by

to
be
one
of
the
finest
novels
written

20th

used
the
title

in
his
1974
pseudo-autobiographical

kidnapped
in

by
50-year-old
mechanic
frank
la

who
had
caught
her
stealing
a

notebook

traveled
with
her
over

21
months
and
is
believed
to
have
raped
her
.
he
claimed
that
he
was

to
``
turn
her

's
``
lolita
''
edit
german
academic
michael
maar
's
book
the
two
lolitas55
describes
his
recent
discovery
of
a
1916
german
short
story
titled
``
lolita
''
whose
middle-aged
narrator
describes
travelling
abroad
as
a
student
.
he
takes
a
room
as
a
lodger
and
instantly
becomes
obsessed
with
the
preteen
girl
also
named
lolita
who
lives
in
the
same
house
.
maar
has
speculated
that
nabokov
may
have
had
cryptomnesia
a
``
hidden
memory
''
of
the
story
that
nabokov
was
unaware
of
while
he
was
composing
lolita
during
the
1950s
.
maar
says
that
until
1937
nabokov
lived
in
the
same
section
of
berlin
as
the
author
heinz
von
eschwege
pen
name
heinz
von
lichberg
and
was
most
likely
familiar
with
his
work
which
was
widely
available
in
germany
during
nabokov
's
time
there.5657
the
philadelphia
inquirer
in
the
article
``
lolita
at
50
did
nabokov
take
literary
liberties
''
says
that
according
to
maar
accusations
of
plagiarism
should
not
apply
and
quotes
him
as
saying
``
literature
has
always
been
a
huge
crucible
in
which
familiar
themes
are
continually
recast
...
nothing
of
what
we
admire
in
lolita
is
already
to
be
found
in
the
tale
the
former
is
in
no
way
deducible
from
the
latter
.

nabokov
on
lolitaedit
afterwordedit
in
1956
nabokov
wrote
an
afterword
to
lolita
``
on
a
book
entitled
lolita
''
that
first
appeared
in
the
first
u.s.
edition
and
has
appeared
thereafter.59
one
of
the
first
things
nabokov
makes
a
point
of
saying
is
that
despite
john
ray
jr.
's
claim
in
the
foreword
there
is
no
moral
to
the
story.60
nabokov
adds
that
``
the
initial
shiver
of
inspiration
''
for
lolita
``
was
somehow
prompted
by
a
newspaper
story
about
an
ape
in
the
jardin
des
plantes
who
after
months
of
coaxing
by
a
scientist
produced
the
first
drawing
ever
charcoaled
by
an
animal
this
sketch
showed
the
bars
of
the
poor
creature
's
cage
''
.61
neither
the
article
nor
the
drawing
has
been
recovered
.
in
response
to
an
american
critic
who
characterized
lolita
as
the
record
of
nabokov
's
``
love
affair
with
the
romantic
novel
''
nabokov
writes
that
``
the
substitution
of
'english
language
'
for
'romantic
novel
'
would
make
this
elegant
formula
more
correct
''
.62
nabokov
concludes
the
afterword
with
a
reference
to
his
beloved
first
language
which
he
abandoned
as
a
writer
once
he
moved
to
the
united
states
in
1940
``
my
private
tragedy
which
can
not
and
indeed
should
not
be
anybody
's
concern
is
that
i
had
to
abandon
my
natural
idiom
my
untrammeled
rich
and
infinitely
docile
russian
language
for
a
second-rate
brand
of
english
''
.63
estimationedit
nabokov
rated
the
book
highly
.
in
an
interview
for
bbc
television
in
1962
he
said
lolita
is
a
special
favorite
of
mine
.
it
was
my
most
difficult
bookâthe
book
that
treated
of
a
theme
which
was
so
distant
so
remote
from
my
own
emotional
life
that
it
gave
me
a
special
pleasure
to
use
my
combinational
talent
to
make
it
real.64
over
a
year
later
in
an
interview
for
playboy
he
said
i
shall
never
regret
lolita
.
she
was
like
the
composition
of
a
beautiful
puzzleâits
composition
and
its
solution
at
the
same
time
since
one
is
a
mirror
view
of
the
other
depending
on
the
way
you
look
.
of
course
she
completely
eclipsed
my
other
worksâat
least
those
i
wrote
in
english
the
real
life
of
sebastian
knight
bend
sinister
my
short
stories
my
book
of
recollections
but
i
can
not
grudge
her
this
.
there
is
a
queer
tender
charm
about
that
mythical
nymphet.65
in
the
same
year
in
an
interview
with
life
nabokov
was
asked
which
of
his
writings
had
most
pleased
him
.
he
answered
i
would
say
that
of
all
my
books
lolita
has
left
me
with
the
most
pleasurable
afterglowâperhaps
because
it
is
the
purest
of
all
the
most
abstract
and
carefully
contrived
.
i
am
probably
responsible
for
the
odd
fact
that
people
do
n't
seem
to
name
their
daughters
lolita
any
more
.
i
have
heard
of
young
female
poodles
being
given
that
name
since
1956
but
of
no
human
beings.66
russian
translationedit
the
russian
translation
includes
a
``
postscriptum
''
67
in
which
nabokov
reconsiders
his
relationship
with
his
native
language
.
referring
to
the
afterword
to
the
english
edition
nabokov
states
that
only
``
the
scientific
scrupulousness
led
me
to
preserve
the
last
paragraph
of
the
american
afterword
in
the
russian
text
...
''
he
further
explains
that
the
``
story
of
this
translation
is
the
story
of
a
disappointment
.
alas
that
'wonderful
russian
language
'
which
i
imagined
still
awaits
me
somewhere
which
blooms
like
a
faithful
spring
behind
the
locked
gate
to
which
i
after
so
many
years
still
possess
the
key
turned
out
to
be
non-existent
and
there
is
nothing
beyond
that
gate
except
for
some
burned
out
stumps
and
hopeless
autumnal
emptiness
and
the
key
in
my
hand
looks
rather
like
a
lock
pick

rich
noted

dark
drama
about

hiroko
mikami
notes
that
the
initial
sexual
encounter
between
lolita
and
humbert
was
staged
in
a
way
that
left
this
adaptation
particularly
open
to
the
charge
of
placing
the
blame
for
initiating
the
relationship
on
lolita
and
normalizing
child
sexual
abuse
however
mikami
challenged
this
reading
of
the
production76
noting
that
the
ultimate
devastation
of
events
on
lolita
's
life
is
duly
noted
in

play

steve

noted
that
it
stressed
humbert
as

moral
monster

madman
rather
than
as
a
suave
seducer
and
that
it
does
nothing
to
``
suggest
sympathy

on

level
of
humbert.78

also
described
it
as
``
less
an

sense

a

monodrama
''
.
the
composer
described
humbert
as
``
deeply
seductive

deeply
evil
''
.
he
expressed
his
desire
to
ignore
the
plot

the
novel
's
elements
of
parody
and
instead
to
put
the
audience
``
in
the
mind
of
a
madman
''
.
he
regarded
himself
as
duplicating
nabokov
's
effect
of
putting
something
on
the
surface
and
undermining
it
an
effect
for
which
he
thought

suited.79

humbert
.
cox
believes
that
this
is
truer
to
the
spirit
of
the
book
than
other
stage
or
film
adaptations
since
the

it

reading
lolita
in
tehran
is
a
memoir
about
teaching
government-banned
western
literary
classics
to
women
in
the
world
of
an
islamic
iran
which
author
azar
nafisi
describes
as
dominated

the
1980s
by
fundamentalist
``

.90
stories
about
the
lives
of
her
book
club
members
are
interspersed
with
critical
commentary
on
lolita
and
three
other
western
novels
.
lolita
in
particular
is
dubbed
the
ultimate
``
forbidden
''
novel
and
becomes
a
metaphor
for
life
in
iran
.
although
nafasi
states
that
the
metaphor
is
not
allegorical
p.
35
she
does
want
to
draw
parallels
between
``
victim
and
jailer
''
p.
37
.
she
implies
that
like
the
principal
character
in
lolita
the
regime
in
iran
imposes
their
``
dream
upon
our
reality
turning
us
into
his
figments
of
imagination
.
''
in
both
cases
the
protagonist
commits
the
``
crime
of
solipsizing

one
of

of

has
admitted
on
multiple

to
a
fascination
and
identification
with

concept.101
marilyn
manson
's
song
``
heart-shaped
glasses
when
the
heart
guides
the
hand
''
was
indirectly
inspired
by
the
novel
and
the
heart-shaped
glasses
worn
by
lolita
in
the
poster
for
stanley
kubrick
's
film
.
in
a
bbc
radio
one
interview
manson
said
he
had
been
reading
the
novel
as
a
consequence
of
now
having
a
much
younger
girlfriend
evan
rachel
wood
.
she
consequently
showed
up
to
meet
him
one
day
wearing
heart-shaped
glasses
which
she
also
wears
in
the
music
video
of
the
song.102
mexican
singer
belinda
released
in
2010
a
homonymous
song
extracted
from
carpe
diem
.
the
song
refers
to
the
novel
in
the
line
``
sin
duda
nabokov
fue
el
que
me
escribiã³
''
which
literally
translates
as
``
without
a
doubt
nabokov
was
the
one
who
wrote
me
.
''
it
became
a
moderate
hit
at
venezuelan
charts.103
rolling
stone
has
noted
that
lana
del
rey
's
2012
album
born
to
die
has
``
loads
of
lolita
references
''
104
and
it
has
a
bonus
track
entitled
``
lolita
''
.
she
has
herself
described
the
album
's
persona
to
a
reviewer
from
the
new
yorker
as
a
combination
of
a
``
gangster
nancy
sinatra
''
and
``
lolita
lost
in
the
hood
.
''
their
reviewer
notes
that
``
her
invocations
of
sinatra
and
lolita
are
entirely
appropriate
to
the
sumptuous
backing
tracks
''
and
that
one
of
the
album
's
singles
off
to
the
races
repeatedly
quotes
from
the
novel
's
opening
sentence
``
