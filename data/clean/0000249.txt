the

gives
the
images
a
little
more
depth
but
they
already
had
heft

.
the

is
a
money-making
gimmick
nothing

audience
reviews
for
finding

½
film
reviewers
have
to
walk
a
very
difficult
tightrope
when
describing
films
that
they
love
.
people
who
value
our
opinions
for
whatever
reasons
expect
a
level
of
passion
and
detailed
knowledge
to
convince
them
how
and
when
to
spend
their
hard-earned
money
and
we
work
hard
to
provide
such
knowledge
and
passion
on
a
regular
basis
.
but
often
a
critic
will
revert
to
childhood
nostalgia
or
some
other
form
of
sentiment
to
unconvincingly
gloss
over
flaws
which
to
anyone
else
are
in
plain
sight.i
find
myself
in
this
position
with
regard
to
finding
nemo
a
film
i
saw
twice
in
cinemas
during
its
long
theatrical
run
and
which
i
have
always
held
in
high
regard
.
having
not
seen
it
for
several
years
and
caught
up
with
most
of
pixar
's
back
catalogue
outside
of
it
i
had
trepidations
about
revisiting
it
in
case
my
love
for
it
turned
out
to
be
rooted
purely
in
nostalgia
.
fortunately
my
fears
have
all
been
laid
to
rest
by
the
simple
fact
that
finding
nemo
is
a
truly
great
film.for
starters
the
film
is
a
fantastic
technical
accomplishment
.
animation
's
ability
to
put
anything
on
screen
is
often
bizarrely
used
to
belittle
its
achievements
we
assume
that
just
because
almost
everything
can
be
done
that
therefore
it
's
very
easy
to
do
anything
.
but
there
is
nothing
easy
or
lazy
about
finding
nemo
's
aesthetics
they
are
the
product
of
years
of
hard
work
and
research
by
highly
talented
craftsman
whose
craft
and
affection
show
through.john
lasseter
pixar
's
head
honcho
and
the
executive
producer
has
always
been
a
fan
of
hands-on
research
.
once
the
project
had
been
green-lit
he
demanded
that
everyone
working
on
the
film
got
certified
at
scuba
diving
and
organised
numerous
diving
trips
to
allow
his
animators
to
study
fish
up
close
in
their
natural
environment
.
as
well
as
getting
a
mechanical
feel
for
this
i.e
.
how
things
move
differently
in
water
compared
to
in
air
much
of
their
findings
ended
up
in
the
films
'
characters
.
clown
fish
are
naturally
shy
creatures
who
rarely
come
out
of
the
anemones
adding
believability
to
albert
brooks
'
portrayal
of
marlin.the
visuals
of
finding
nemo
are
beautiful
on
every
level
.
andrew
stanton
and
lee
unkrich
bring
us
a
world
of
rich
colour
and
many
textured
shades
all
the
while
convincing
us
that
we
are
underwater
.
they
pay
particular
attention
to
the
way
that
light
reflects
and
refracts
as
it
moves
from
the
surface
through
the
denser
water
adjusting
the
colour
palette
ever
so
subtly
whenever
we
move
into
deeper
territories
.
certain
mechanics
are
altered
to
enable
characters
to
cry
or
bleed
in
ways
we
would
recognise
but
overall
this
is
both
believable
and
realistic.in
addition
to
its
spectacular
visuals
finding
nemo
is
a
brilliant
example
of
how
to
handle
multiple
story-lines
on
screen
.
like
toy
story
2
before
it
there
is
not
a
single
edit
which
is
out
of
place
and
not
a
single
section
that
runs
on
too
long
.
the
transitions
between
one
group
of
characters
and
another
group
are
beautifully
judged
it
's
never
left
so
long
that
it
feels
like
we
are
neglecting
a
character
or
so
short
that
it
feels
desperate.this
in
turn
lifts
the
story
of
finding
nemo
from
something
seemingly
simple
to
feeling
more
complex
and
layered
.
it
is
at
its
most
basic
level
a
road
movie
with
two
characters
on
a
long
journey
from
a
to
b
encountering
many
strange
creatures
and
events
along
the
way
some
of
which
are
helpful
some
potentially
harmful
.
in
weaker
hands
the
film
would
either
feel
overly
long
and
dull
or
could
become
very
episodic
with
the
set-pieces
not
building
to
a
resonant
climax
.
but
this
is
pixar
and
they
know
a
thing
or
two
about
raising
the
stakes.the
film
has
many
memorable
moments
each
of
which
feel
like
an
escalation
from
the
previous
one
.
the
first
time
we
meet
bruce
the
shark
it
's
a
big
deal
but
after
the
underwater
mines
blow
up
and
the
angler
fish
arrives
he
seems
a
walk
in
the
park
by
comparison
.
the
same
goes
for
the
jellyfish
the
whale
and
finally
the
fishing
boat
which
marlin
and
dory
run
into
with
the
mask
and
its
message
tying
everything
together
very
nicely.running
through
finding
nemo
is
the
theme
of
letting
go
specifically
parents
letting
go
of
their
children
and
allow
them
to
have
their
own
adventures
.
marlin
is
overprotective
of
his
son
nemo
because
of
the
loss
of
his
wife
and
other
babies
in
the
opening
scene
-
an
attitude
consolidated
by
his
son
's
birth
defect
the
``
lucky
fin
''
.
by
being
stifled
for
so
long
nemo
is
compelled
to
disobey
after
his
very
first
taste
of
the
outside
world
and
quickly
discovers
how
frightening
it
can
be
.
as
the
father
journeys
to
find
his
son
both
discover
that
there
are
times
when
letting
go
and
trusting
others
is
the
only
way
to
go.there
is
a
comparison
in
this
regard
with
gravity
which
has
just
garnered
11
bafta
nominations
and
a
further
10
for
the
oscars
.
regardless
of
its
eventual
performance
at
either
ceremony
finding
nemo
itself
an
oscar
winner
does
a
much
better
job
at
conveying
this
underlying
theme
.
while
their
stories
may
seem
equally
straightforward
on
paper
the
storytelling
here
is
better
the
characters
are
more
rounded
and
there
is
less
of
an
overwhelming
sense
of
effects
cornering
the
market
for
innovation
.
as
great
as
the
visuals
here
are
they
do
not
distract
from
the
story
as
those
in
gravity
often
did.equally
while
gravity
's
protagonists
were
overly
conventional
the
characters
in
finding
nemo
are
as
rounded
and
compelling
as
we
have
come
to
expect
from
pixar
.
marlin
's
conservative
nature
is
rooted
in
good
intentions
and
he
has
qualities
that
we
would
recognise
in
parents
we
know
and
admire
.
while
dreamworks
might
play
dory
's
short-term
memory
loss
purely
for
laughs
here
it
both
lightens
the
mood
and
deepens
her
character
.
dory
has
a
pathos
to
her
which
comes
to
a
head
when
she
and
marlin
part
ways
making
her
scatterbrained
moments
all
the
more
endearing.in
addition
to
its
parental
themes
finding
nemo
also
has
a
subtext
about
overcoming
disability
.
both
nemo
and
gill
have
fins
which
are
damaged
or
underdeveloped
in
some
way
and
both
are
initially
defined
by
them
nemo
's
dad
smothers
him
because
of
it
while
gill
wears
his
as
a
battle
scar
and
thereby
seems
all
the
more
determined
to
escape
.
both
characters
eventually
overcome
their
limitations
in
the
physical
act
of
escaping
but
nemo
goes
one
further
in
refusing
to
let
it
prevent
him
live
life
to
the
full
.
as
soon
as
he
gets
home
he
goes
straight
back
out
to
explore
the
open
ocean.finding
nemo
is
also
brilliant
at
balancing
its
tone
.
there
are
a
lot
of
dark
and
scary
moments
such
as
the
obstacles
listed
before
and
the
film
is
occasionally
a
little
too
blatant
in
reinforcing
the
horror
tone
with
obvious
references
to
the
shining
in
bruce
's
attack
and
psycho
in
the
scenes
with
darla
.
but
elsewhere
the
film
is
a
barrel
of
laughs
whether
it
's
crush
's
spaced-out
surfer
ramblings
dory
's
forgetfulness
or
the
various
exploits
of
the
tank
gang
.
it
's
a
very
funny
film
for
all
the
family
which
balances
light
and
dark
superbly.the
voice
acting
on
finding
nemo
is
great
as
we
've
come
to
expect
.
albert
brooks
is
great
as
marlin
using
his
quivering
voice
to
bring
the
characters
'
anxieties
to
the
foreground
.
ellen
degeneres
is
inspired
as
dory
talking
as
quickly
and
as
boisterously
as
she
does
on
her
talk
show
but
still
managing
to
pull
things
back
during
the
sadder
moments
.
barry
humphries
is
very
well-cast
as
bruce
pulling
off
his
introduction
with
great
aplomb
and
alexander
gould
does
a
good
job
with
the
title
character
.
even
willem
dafoe
who
can
sometimes
drift
into
pantomime
is
very
convincing
as
the
raspy
determined
gill.finding
nemo
is
a
truly
great
film
which
sits
alongside
monsters
inc.
as
one
of
the
high
points
of
pixar
's
output
.
while
it
does
n't
have
quite
the
emotional
depth
or
narrative
complexity
of
the
toy
story
films
it
is
very
hard
to
find
any
other
fault
with
it
.
it
's
a
beautifully-made
beautifully-acted
beautifully-written
film
which
will
continue
to
enchant
audiences
for
decades
to
come
.
one
only
hopes
that
the
upcoming
sequel
came
live
up
to
the
same
standards
.

finding

me

the
years
.
it
's
not
my
favorite
pixar
movie
by
far
but
it
's
definitely
well
made
and
visually
flawless

the
story
is
n't
all
that
complex

it
does
n't
need
to
when
the
backdrop

definitely
in
the
minority
on
that

overall
it

a
worthwhile

finding
nemo
''
is
a
wonderful
animated
adventure
movie
that
simply
is
irresistible
for
young
as
well
as
older
persons.the
most
excellent
thing
about
``
finding
nemo
''
is
the
perfect
timing
just
like
in
``
monsters
inc
''
the
jokes
are
extremely
well
placed
in
a
quick
pace
and
are
good
for
more
then
just
a
few
laughs.there
are
some
very
fun
and
great
characters
which
brings
me
to
the
only
problem
i
have
with
this
movie
.
there
are
too
many
minor
characters
i
would
have
really
loved
to
see
some
of
the
characters
getting
a
bigger
role
with
some
more
importance
to
the
story
instead
of
meeting
character
after
character
that
are
only
on
screen
for
no
more
than
5
minutes
such
as
the
sharks
.
sure
it
's
good
for
the
sense
of
adventure
but
it
leaves
some
missed
opportunities
to
make
the
story
even
more
fun.i
think
it
's
pretty
obvious
that
the
story
is
inspired
on
the
``
lord
of
the
rings
''
trilogy
since
it
uses
lot
's
of
elements
from
it
and
it
has
the
some
feeling
of
adventure
and
excitement
so
it
's
really
not
a
big
thing
that
the
story
is
n't
very
original
the
original
and
fun
way
the
story
is
told
in
compensates
for
this.the
voice
cast
as
in
many
animated
movies
is
impressive
but
the
one
that
stood
out
was
ellen
degeneres
as
dory
that
you
love
to
hate.irresistible
movie
for
the
whole
family
with
great
jokes
and
lines
and
some
memorable
characters
and
situations
