the

as
many
have
said
the
story
isnt
anything
new
but
it
does
not
have
to
be
.
this
was
an
incredible
feast
for
the

if
your

this

john

super

many
of
the
things
that
i
loved
about
this
film
are
the
exact
things
that
caused
my
discontent
.
to
begin
with
much
of
the
visuals
were
obviously
astounding
.
the
design
of
the
planet
as
well
as
the
design
of
the
plant
and
animal
life
and
the
vehicles
used
by
the
humans
were
incredibly
impressive
.
cameron
also
used
color
very
well
.
on
the
other
hand
the
computer
generated
characters
were
far
too
cartoonish
and
the
real
life
characters
and
computer
generated
ones
didnt
blend
together
quite
as
well
as
i
had
hoped
for
considering
how
advanced
this
film
was
supposed
to
be
.
i
would
have
much
rather
preferred
costumes
and
make
up
than
the
cartoonish
look
the
film
had
.
while
the
planet
looked
impressive
david
lean
made
more
visually
stunning
films
using
actual
landscapes
rather
than
artificial
ones
.
the
story
also
had
its
up
and
down
points
.
on
the
one
hand
the
story
was
engaging
enough
that
even
after
160
minutes
i
could
have
kept
watching
if
the
film
were
longer
.
on
the
other
hand
the
dialogue
was
very
weak
most
elements
of
the
story
were
completely
recycled
and
unoriginal
and
the
main
antagonist
of
the
film
was
as
cheesy
of
a
villain
as
we
could
have
received
.
he
was
basically
a
caricature
of
the
villains
of
the
corn
ball
action
flicks
of
the
80
's
.
the
film
also
relied
too
much
on
the
demonization
of
humanity
in
order
to
serve
its
agenda
.
cameron
left
the
entire
human
race
completely
underdeveloped
allowing
no
conviction
to
the
masses
of
people
on
pandora
who
were
far
too
willing
to
slaughter
innocent
natives
and
he
unfortunately
left
us
completely
in
the
dark
as
to
what
earth
or
contemporary
humanity
looked
like
.
finally
the
film
uses
a
macguffin
in
the
form
of
``
unobtainian
''
which
is
a
stupid
name
for
the
mineral
that
is
more
of
a
plot
hole
than
a
point
of
interest
.
its
more
entertaining
than
it
is
interesting
and
is
not
without
some
pretty
massive
flaws
.

an

in

there
could
be
20000
of
'em

at

they
will
overrun

that
's
not

na
happen
.
our
only
security
lies
in
preemptive
attack
.
we
will
fight
terror
with
terror
.
the
hostiles
believe
that
this
mountain
territory
is
protected
by
their
...
deity
.
and
when
we
destroy
it
we
will
blast
a
crater
in
their
racial
memory
so
deep
that
they
wo
n't
come
within
1000
klicks
of

and
that
too
is
