down

elizabeth
realizes
the

is
specifically
after

she
kisses
him
passionately
and
as
she
does
will
who
is
climbing
down
the
ship
to
the
wooden
``

witnesses
the
kiss

says
nothing

is

hurt

elizabeth
uses
the
opportunity
to
chain
jack
to
the
mast
as
the
rest
of

escape
from

jack
has
seemingly
decided
to
show
his
good
side
by
returning
to
help
at
the
risk
of
his
own
life
while
elizabeth
for
once
throws
her
own
sense
of
honor
and
decency
to
the
wind
both
by
kissing
jack
and
by
chaining
him
to
the
mast
to
save
herself
.
she
tells
everybody
in
the
lifeboat
they
escape
in
that
jack
has
``
elected
''
to
remain
aboard
and
go
down
with
his
ship
and
they
sail
away
from
the
black
pearl
.
jack
manages
to
slip
out
of
his
shackles
just
as
the
kraken
appears
on
all
sides
of
the
ship
trapping
him
.
jack
grabs
a
sword
and
the
last
we
see
of
him
he
is
smiling
and
saying
``
hello
beastie
''
and
attacking
the
kraken
as
the
monster
destroys
the
black
pearl
and
drags
her
underwater
to
her
grave
.
davy

sees
this
and
proclaims
jack

debt
fulfilled
.
however
he
then
realizes
that
something
is
not
right
and
asks
to
see
the
``
chest

.
after
realizing
his
heart
has
been
stolen
and
believing
jack

it
when
