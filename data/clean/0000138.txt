blu-ray
this
review
is
for
the
``
titanic
in
3d
''
movie
on
blu
ray
holidaying
in
ireland
i
happened
on
the
preview
day
of
james
cameron
's
``
titanic
in
3d
''
at
the
new
odeon
cinema
in
the
point
area
of
dublin
's
refurbished
docklands
or
``
the
quays
''
as
they
're
known
locally
.
we
caught
the
first
showing
on
5
april
2012
-
debuting
on
their
all-bells-and-whistles
``
isense
screen
''
.
``
isense
''
features
razor
sharp
real-3d
imaging
on
a
gigantic
screen
with
state-of-the-art
surround
sound
.
so
myself
and
the
two
kids
popped
along
-
donned
the
crazy
specs
-
and
started
to
watch
.
the
sheer
spectacle
of
what
came
next
has
prompted
me
to
write
this
review
...
i
've
seen
about
10
films
in
3d
-
some
like
``
despicable
me
''
have
impressed
and
actually
met
the
hype
-
the
rest
have
either
felt
gimmicky
or
a
downright
hindrance
-
or
worse
a
crass
monetary
exploitation
.
even
the
new
aardman
animation
feature
film
``
the
pirates
...
''
-
which
we
'd
seen
some
days
earlier
-
is
not
great
in
3d
although
it
's
a
top
movie
and
thoroughly
recommended
.
but
cameron
's
complete
reshaping
of
``
titanic
''
into
a
3d
realm
is
a
different
beast
.
it
's
incredible
and
at
times
i
was
genuinely
gobsmacked
.
i
saw
the
film
on
its
original
outing
in
1997
which
was
a
cinematic
experience
to
say
the
least
and
i
'd
estimate
that
65
to
75
of
this
version
has
been
improved
by
the
3d
process
with
the
remaining
portions
varying
between
not
changed
at
all
or
just
slightly
better
-
but
definitely
better.so
what
's
changed
scenes
that
were
somehow
'ordinary
'
before
are
now
'dimensional
'
-
at
times
you
feel
you
could
reach
out
and
actually
touch
them

blu-ray
we
all
know
the
story
so
my
review
is
for
the
quality
of
the
blu
ray
image
quality
and
3d
.
the
quality
of
the
image
is
very
impressive
.
the
colors
are
vivid
a
lot
of
contrast
very
clear
picture
.
it
's
hard
to
believe
that
this
movie
was
converted
from
2d
to
3d
because
the
3d
effect
is
one
of
the
best
i
've
ever
seen
.
there
was
no
noticeable
ghosting
.
i
had
seen
the
3d
version
of
this
movie
in
the
theatre
and
thought
it
was
good
.
however
it
is
even
more
impressive
on
my
3d
tv
47
inch
lg
.
the
characters
often
appear
to
be
with
me
in
the
room
they
pop
out
of
the
screen
.
there
is
a
lot
of
depth
throughout
the
movie
which
is
also
visable
in
darker
scenes
.
the
picture
is
amazing
.
you
get
the
feeling
that
you
are
in
the
movie
...
when
the
boat
sinks
you
feel
as
if
you
're
part
of
the
action
.
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
quality
of
the
3d
.
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
owns
a
3d
tv
...
worth
every
penny
