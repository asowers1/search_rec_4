biography
born
on
february
7
1812
charles
dickens
was
the
second
of
eight
children
in
a
family
burdened
with
financial
troubles
.
despite
difficult
early
years
he
became
the
most
successful
british
writer
of
the
victorian
age
.
in
1824
young
charles
was
withdrawn
from
school
and
forced
to
work
at
a
boot-blacking
factory
when
his
improvident
father
accompanied
by
his
mother
and
siblings
was
sentenced
to
three
months
in
a
debtor
's
prison
.
once
they
were
released
charles
attended
a
private
school
for
three
years
.
the
young
man
then
became
a
solicitor
's
clerk
mastered
shorthand
and
before
long
was
employed
as
a
parliamentary
reporter
.
when
he
was
in
his
early
twenties
dickens
began
to
publish
stories
and
sketches
of
london
life
in
a
variety
of
periodicals
.
it
was
the
publication
of
pickwick
papers
1836-1837
that
catapulted
the
twenty-five-year-old
author
to
national
renown
.
dickens
wrote
with
unequaled
speed
and
often
worked
on
several
novels
at
a
time
publishing
them
first
in
monthly
installments
and
then
as
books
.
his
early
novels
oliver

1837-1838
nicholas
nickleby
1838-1839
the
old
curiosity
shop
1840-1841
and
a
christmas
carol
1843
solidified
his
enormous
ongoing
popularity
.
as
dickens
matured
his
social
criticism
became
increasingly
biting
his
humor
dark
and
his
view
of
poverty
darker
still
.

read
an
excerpt
from
gillen
d'arcy
wood
's
introduction
to
a
tale
of
two
cities
when
dickens
expressed
to
a.
h.
layard
his
fear
of
revolution
in
britain
in
1855
he
only
echoed
many
dozens
of
commentators
over
the
preceding
six
decades
who
wondered
why
mob
violence
could
not
simply
cross
the
english
channel
and
turn
the
streets
of
london
into
a
bloodbath
of
class
retribution
.
the
textbook
historian
's
answer
points
to
the
bloodless
coup
of
1688
the
so-called
glorious
revolution
which
saw
the
tyrant
james
ii
forced
into
exile
and
william
and
mary
inaugurate
a
form
of
managerial
rule
in
britain
a
constitutional
``
mixed
''
monarchy
where
many
absolute
powers
of
the
crown
were
ceded
to
parliament
.
with
the
consolidation
of
that
legislative
body
however
unrepresentative
britain
's
nobility
insured
itself
against
the
apocalyptic
disaster
that
was
to
befall
their
french
counterparts
.
the
divergent
tale
of
the
two
cities
thus
begins
in
1688
.
but
as
a
novelist
dickens
who
loved
paris
and
traveled
there
often
offers
more
intuitive
closely
observed
reasons
for
the
untranslatable
quality
of
that
city
's
revolution
.
in
an
1856
article
for
his
weekly
magazine
household
words
he
calls
paris
``
the
moon
''
and
describes
a
culture
of
spectacle
implicitly
alien
to
his
london
readers
.
on
the
grand
parisian
boulevards
dickens
watches
the
upper
classes
put
on
``
a
mighty
show
.
''
later
he
takes
coffee
and
a
cigar
at
one
of
paris
's
ubiquitous
cafãs
and
participates
in
a
kind
of
collective
voyeurism
unfamiliar
to
the
english
capital
the
place
from
which
the
shop
front
has
been
taken
makes
a
gay
proscenium
as
i

and
smoke
the
street
becomes
a
stage
with
an
endless
procession
of
lively
actors

and
re-crossing

we
are

373-374
.
paris
is
a
society
of
spectacle
a
glamorous
outdoor
``
stage
''
where
citizens
are
both
actors
and
audience
.
later
in
the
article
however
dickens
describes
a
more
sinister
aspect
of
this
culture
of
display
when
he
is
jostled
by
the
crowds
at
the
paris
morgue
whose
``
bodies
lie
on
inclined
planes
within
a
great
glass
window
as
though
holbein
should
represent
death
in
his
grim
dance
keeping
a
shop
and
displaying
his
goods
like
a
regent
street
or
boulevard
linen-draper
''
p.
375
.
dickens
is
unnerved
here
as
he
was
at
horsemonger
lane
by
a
society
that
places
no
restraints
on
visibility
even
to
preserve
the
solemnity
of
the
dead
.
it
is
a
short
step
in
dickens
's
imagination
from
the
peep-show
atmosphere
of
the
paris
morgue
in
1856
to
the
ritual
slaughter
in
the
place
de
la
rãvolution
during
robespierre
's
``
reign
of
terror
''
of
1793-1794
.
a
tale
of
two
cities
shows
the
dark
side
of
urban
theatricality
that
a
public
appetite
for
glamorous
``
show
''
can
rapidly
degenerate
into
an
insatiable
hunger
for
``
scenes
of
horror
and
demoralization
.
''
the
essentially
theatrical
quality
of
parisian
social
life
produces
a
theatrical
revolution
.
at
the
revolutionary
``
trials
''
at
the
hall
of
examination
madame
defarge
we
are
told
``
clapped
her
hands
as
at
a
play
.
''
there
is
something
uniquely
parisian
too
in
the
spectacle
of
the
liberation
of
the
bastille
with
only
seven
prisoners
inside
and
in
the
rituals
of
the
terror
itself
as
the
tumbrils
roll
daily
to
the
guillotine
watched
by
knitting
ladies
who
take
up
seats
in
their
favored
spots
each
morning
as
if
at
a
sideshow
or
circus
.
as
dickens
describes
it
even
the
victims
of
the
terror
can
not
escape
the
theatrical
atmosphere
of
the
proceedings
.
among
the
condemned
``
there
are
some
so
heedful
of
their
looks
that
they
cast
upon
the
multitude
such
glances
as
they
have
seen
in
theatres
and
in
pictures
.
''
contrast
this
with
charles
darnay
who
on
trial
for
his
life
earlier
in
the
novel
disdains
``
the
play
at
the
old
bailey
''
he
``
neither
flinched
from
the
situation
nor
assumed
any
theatrical
air
in
it
.
''
our
hero
disappoints
us
on
occasion
but
here
by
resisting
being
converted
into
a
spectacle
he
defends
the
most
important
social
principle
of
the
novel
the
dignity
of
the
private
citizen
in
the
face
of
the
howling
mob
.

we
sat
on

eating
oranges

morning

reading
a

it

dickens
at
his
best
this
is
quite
possibly
the
best
book
that
dickens
wrote
.
'a
tale
of
two
cities
'
has
everything
a
reader
could
ask
a
complex
and
interesting
plot
realistic
characters
excellent
character
development
and
overarching
social
and
political
messages
.
in
addition
to
being
an
exemplary
work
of
fiction
any
serious
student
of
post-renaissance
european
history
should
examine
this
text
for
its
historiographical
value
.
despite
the
destitute
situation
of
the
french
people
before
the
french
revolution
their
lives
were
not
aided
in
most
ways
that
the
contemporary
advocates
of
the
revolution
purported
.

dull
beginning
but
well
worth
it
a
tale
of
two
cities
is
a
true
literary
classic
.
it
superbly
combines
the
key
topics
of
history
politics
tragedy
love
and
war
all
into
one
fantastic
work
.
the
entirety
of
the
book
is
split
between
the
two
cities
of
london
england
and
paris
france
.
it
chronicles
the
course
of
events
that
took
place
in
these
two
cities
in
the
time
just
before
and
during
the
french
revolution
.
this
piece
of
writing
excellence
has
truly
made
me
thankful
for
the
time
and
place
in
which
i
live
.
the
squalor
and
repression
the
majority
of
the
populations
of
both
england
and
france
survived
in
during
this
period
to
be
absolutely
repulsive
i
find
it
remarkable
that
dickens
was
able
to
capture
and
project
the
true
feelings
of
want
and
need
expressed
throughout
the
book
onto
the
reader
.
at
times
i
felt
as
if
i
myself
was
sitting
in
a
back
room
of
the
paris
france
branch
of
tellson
's
bank
with
mr.
lorry
while
the
citizens
of
paris
are
actively
mobbing
outside
.
only
a
select
few
books
have
ever
made
me
feel
quite
this
connected
to
their
plot
something
this
book
does
superbly
.
now
while
i
have
been
raving
about
a
tale
of
two
cities
i
must
say
that
the
first
200
pages
were
quite
dull
and
arduous
.
i
almost
put
the
book
down
several
times
because
of
it
.
but
once
you
clear
the
dull
beginning
this
classic
really
heats
up
and
becomes
a
very
exciting
fast-paced
read
.
one
reservation
i
had
with
the
book
was
its
'
enormous
glorification
of
the
horrible
killing
machine
the
guillotine
.
this
machine
was
referred
to
as
a
tall
beautiful
and
deadly
woman
and
the
blood
of
the
thousands
executed
upon
it
was
referred
to
as
her
wine
.
i
found
the
amount
of
detail
dickens
used
to
describe
the
repression
of
the
common
people
by
the
nobles
to
be
fascinating
especially
given
the
time
period
in
which
this
book
was
first
published
.
one
of
my
favorite
aspects
of
a
tale
of
two
cities
was
how
it
so
fluidly
it
intertwined
the
two
halves
of
the
story
.
though
the
french
side
of
the
story
was
so
very
far
removed
from
the
english
side
of
the
story
that
is
until
``
book
the
third
''
begins
it
still
feels
to
the
reader
like
one
fluid
complete
story
.
even
while
managing
to
floridly
intertwine
to
separate
stories
mr.
dickens
managed
to
hide
the
true
personalities
of
two
of
the
main
characters
until
the
perfect
moment
to
reveal
them
.
this
along
with
the
truly
fantastic
traits
of
the
other
characters
allows
this
book
to
all
but
jump
of
the
pages
and
into
reality
the
characters
of
charles
dickens
seemed
to
me
as
real
and
human
as
if
they
were
standing
right
in
front
of
me
my
one
complaint
about
this
magnificent
work
is
that
the
beginning
seemingly
drags
on
forever
.
i
am
a
reader
who
likes
books
that
get
right
into
the
plot
and
do
n't
drag
on
too
much
.
because
of
this
a
tale
of
two
cities
discouraged
me
early
on
but
i
urge
you
not
to
get
discouraged
and
give
up
on
the
book
if
you
persevere
the
ending
will
reward
you
beyond
measure

i
also
recommend
notes
should
not
ruin
the
story
while
a
tale
of
two
cities
is
a
great
book
some
of
gillen
d'arcy
wood
's
notes
are
very
bad
.
one
note
in
chapter
4
of
book
two
tells
the
reader
that
something
is
foreshadowing
a
certain
character
's
death
thus
ruining
any
surprise
.
this
is
unacceptable

a
true
classic
charles
dickens
has
a
unique
story
telling
style
that
evokes
the
days
of
sitting
by
the
fire
listening
to
an
artful
story
teller
spin
a
yarn
.
he
manages
to
weave
political
commentary
historical
fact
and
a
group
of
fictional
characters
into
a
gripping
tale
of
love
deceit
and
true
international
intrigue
.
it
is
easy
to
see
why
this
book
is
considered
a
classic
.
forget
your
high
school
bias
that
classic
novels
are
boring
.
read
this
book
with
an
open
mind
and
you
will
soon
get
lost
in
a
far
away
time
and
form
a
lasting
bond
with
the
characters

of

charles

is
an
overall
well
writt
a
tale
of
two
cities
by
charles
dickens
is
an
overall
well
written
book
.
i
dont
think
that
it
was
my
favorite
novel
but
i
do
think
that
it
was
a
good
story
and
i
am
glad
that
i
read
it
.
this
book
is
a
classic
that
is
loved
by
many
people
all
across
the
world
.
there
are
only
a
few
reasons
why
the
only
things
that
make
me
say
that
i
didnt
absolutely
love
the
book
.
the
primary
reason
is
that
it
was
difficult
to
follow
at
times
.
i
wasnt
quite
sure
what
was
going
on
during
certain
parts
of
the
book
.
however
the
faster
you
know
which
character
is
which
then
the
easier
the
book
will
be
to
read
.
it
is
very
difficult
if
you
dont
know
the
characters
very
well
.
that
makes
this
book
a
difficult
book
to
start
reading
.
the
beginning
is
very
slow
and
the
story
doesnt
seem
to
pick
up
its
pace
until
later
on
in
the
book
.
there
were
some
chapters
that
i
had
to
read
multiple
times
just
to
understand
what
was
going
on
.
when
you
are
reading
this
book
you
need
to
limit
your
distractions
in
order
to
focus
on
the
story
.
when
the
story
speeds
up
however
it
is
a
very
good
book
and
well
worth
the
read
.
it
starts
to
get
very
suspenseful
especially
later
on
in
the
book
.
for
example
in
part
three
i
just
wanted
to
read
through
the
whole
book
to
find
out
what
would
happen
.
i
would
recommend
this
book
to
any
and
all
readers
who
can
read
high
level
books
and
enjoy
history
.
i
actually
learned
a
lot
just
from
reading
this
book
.
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
book
to
anyone
who
is
going
to
lose
interest
in
the
book
before
the
first
one
hundred
pages
however
.
if
you
are
looking
for
an
action
packed
novel
that
is
easy
to
read
then
keep
looking
.
a
tale
of
two
cities
is
a
slower
paced
sometimes
confusing
book
that
has
an
interesting
and
suspenseful
story
and
is
well
worth
reading
.
if
you
are
looking
for
challenge
and
you
dont
lose
interest
too
easily
then
i
highly
suggest
picking
up
a
tale
of
two
cities
.
find
yourself
a
quiet
corner
and
dive
in
.
you
will
be
glad
that
you
read
it
