.
i
was
actually
introduced
to
this
book
in
one
of
the
best
ways
i
can
imagine
a
friend
recorded
the
entire
book
on
tape
and
for
a
couple
months
i
played
the
tapes
of
her
reading
a
chapter
or
two
just
before
i
fell
asleep
each
night
.
my
slow
exposure
to
the
book
under
ideal
circumstances
may
have
influenced
my
perceptions
but
i
can
say
on
each
subsequent
rereading
of
the
book
i
've
come
to
appreciate
it
more
.
you
can
read
the
book
just
for
the
story
apparently
the
author
wrote
the
book
from
stories
he
would
tell
his
children
and
it
still
can
easily
serve
that
purpose
.
but
the
richness
of
his
characters
lead
to
many
interesting
analogies
to
human
life
.
for
instance
from
hazel
you
can
learn
profound
things
about
leadership
.
throughout
the
book
you
feel
that
hazel
is
the
natural-born
leader
of
his
group
of
rabbits
but
richard
adams
was
very
careful
to
develop
this
impression
through
character
features
rather
than
power-relations
.
the
contrast
is
clearly
intentional
since
the
other
leaders
of
the
book
achieve
leadership
status
through
very
different
means
.
many
people
think
the
book
takes
a
strong
stance
against
a
particular
kind
of
authoritarian
rule
but
it
is
important
to
recognize
the
book
gives
this
impression
not
through
structured
diatribe
or
through
argument
but
rather
it
evolves
out
of
character
considerations
and
out
of
the
story
itself
.
this
means
that
the
result
is
far
more
complex
than
a
simple
argument
.
for
instance
although
general
woundwort
may
be
seen
as
the
main
enemy
that
hazel
has
to
deal
with
and
the
authoritarian
rabbit
is
portrayed
rather
negatively
at
times
adams
quite
intentionally
adds
some
details
that
make
him
admirable
to
the
other
rabbits
even
to
the
very
end
.
a
diatribe
would
not
be
so
complex
.
fiver
is
another
great
character
.
he
adds
an
element
of
magic
to
the
story
and
it
allows
adams
to
link
the
rabbits
he
describes
to
a
mythical
world
that
enters
into
the
story
quite
frequently
.
one
can
almost
see
fiver
as
a
manifestation
of
imagination
in
this
world
.
big-wig
is
another
likable
character
and
the
story
of
this
rabbits
experience
in
efrafa
is
one
of
the
highlights
of
the
story
.
besides
the
characters
the
descriptions
of
england
are
also
quite
acute
.
you
can
actually
track
the
course
of
the
rabbits
on
maps
since
adams
was
careful
to
describe
real
places
and
things
.
that
attention
to
detail
is
often
missed
in
reviews
of
this
book
.
finally
the
thing
that
brings
all
these
features
together
and
makes
the
book
more
than
a
mere
story
or
an
account
of
human
characters
or
a
diatribe
against
fascism
is
the
fact
that
adams
is
quite
conscious
of
the
fact
that
he
is
telling
the
story
from
the
perspective
of
rabbits
.
the
challenges
they
face
are
rabbit-sized
the
ideas
about
the
external
world
are
rabbitlike
the
philosophical
insights
seem
rabbitized
and
adams
brings
many
of
our
anthropomorphized
ideas
of
rabbits
together
with
the
reality
of
rabbits
in
a
surprisingly
coherent
fashion
.
i
suppose
the
book
can
be
seen
as
a
cultural
study
of
an
imaginatively
rich
but
realistic
rabbit
world
.
i
realize
as
i
write
this
review
that
many
other
readers
may
not
feel
the
same
way
about
the
book
as
i
do
.
it
does
have
some
shortcomings
.
for
instance
female
characters
only
make
a
few
appearances
in
the
book
although
i
think
adams
does
show
some
sensitivity
in
their
depictions
.
but
even
with
the
limitations
i
would
recommend
the
book
to
anyone
who
likes
a
good
story
and
who
is
willing
to
think
deeply
about
a
children
's
story
.

who
is

foresee
a

.
their
adventures
are
varied
and
engaging
both
while
they
trek
to
the
place
they
will
eventually
call
home
the
eponymous
watership
down
and
as
they
attempt
to
search
for
does
to
help
re-populate
their
new
warren
from
the
militaristic
efrafa.adams
does
a
neat
trick
in
dealing
with
his
rabbit
characters
.
they
are
not
quite
humans
and
the
way
they
try
to
puzzle
out
the
world
around
them
in
a
very
animal-like
way
makes
them
more
than
just
people
in
bunny-suits
though
at
the
same
time
they
are
human-like
and
varied
enough
to
engage
the
reader
.
they
have
their
own
language
with
words
and
concepts
derived
from
their
understanding
of
the
world
and
perhaps
most
engagingly
they
tell
stories
and
myths
based
on
their
beloved
folk-hero
el-ahrairah
.
these
stories
peppered
throughout
the
book
as
chapters
are
some
of
the
most
enjoyable
parts
of
the
tale
and
add
a
depth
and
interest
to
the
rabbits
and
their
'culture
'
that
is
very
endearing.the
rabbits
themselves
fill
certain
archetypal
roles
the
leader
the
warrior
the
seer
the
scientist
the
villain
while
at
the
same
time
retaining
individual
characters
and
even
developing
as
the
story
progresses
.
this
is
definitely
not
a
children
's
story
of
'fluffy
wabbits
'
even
if
only
taken
at
surface
level
and
when
looked
at
below
the
surface
it
is
a
satisfying
and
fulfilling
tale
well
worthy
of
the
title
``
classic
''
.re-read

yup
this
is
still
a
fantastic
read
.
man
that
ending
always
gets
me
sniff
.
i
think
what
really
makes
this
story
sing
are
the
layers
.
everything
builds
on
all
that
came
before
it
whether
it
's
plot
character
or
theme
.
we
grow
to
love
a
group
of
characters
that
may
at
first
have
seemed
rather
silly
and
what
had
started
out
as
a
simple
here-to-there
quest
turns
into
for
me
at
least
something
much
more
.
oh
and
one
other
thing
bigwig
is
the
man
his
last
stand
against
woundwort
is
an
amazing
moment
but
there
's
a
reason
why
hazel
was
chief
rabbit
.

so
and
i
was
not
interested
in
continuing
.
i
put
it
down
.
in
all
honesty
it
seemed
like
it
was
going
to
be
too
babyish
for
me
.
i
mean
come
on
bunnies
though
seriously
about
a
week
ago
i
got
to
a
point
where
i
didnât
have
anything
else
to
read
so
there
i
was
staring
pensively
at
my
obese
bookshelf
thinking
about
reading
lord
of
the
rings
for
the
12th
time
when
i
noticed
watership
down
poking
its
cute
little
bunny
face
out
at
me
.
i
figured
hey
itâs
almost
easter
so
what
the
heck
i
might
as
well
try
it
again
.
so
i
picked
watership
down
back
up
with
the
intent
of
giving
it
just
a
few
more
pages
.
much
to
my
surprise
i
was
hooked

aside
i
thought
this
was
excellent
.
i
was
not
expecting
to
like
it
and
that
is
why
i
am
so
shocked
that
i
did
.
there
was
a
lot
more
depth
to
this
book
than
i
ever
expected
.
âmany
human
beings
say
that
they
enjoy
the
winter
but
what
they
really
enjoy
is
feeling
proof
against
it.â
the
characters
were
great
i
loved
every
single
one
of
them
.
bigwig
was
my
favorite
.
i
donât
know
how
anyone
could
read
this
book
and
not
fall
in
love
with
bigwig
aka
thlayli
.
âmy
chief
rabbit
has
told
me
to
stay
and
defend
this
run
and
until
he
says
otherwise
i
shall
stay
here.â
and
lastly
how
is
this
a
childrenâs
book
i
am
still
trying
to
figure
that
one
out
.
aside
from
the
fact
that
the
story
is
about
a
group
of
animals
there
was
really
nothing
that
screamed
âchildrenâs
bookâ
to
me
.
if
you
are
a
fan
of
fantasy
you
should
definitely
check
it
out
.
i
promise
you
wonât
regret
it
.
it
is
amazingly
well
written
â
it
is
not
categorized
as
a
classic

my

suit
the

...
watership
down

now
i
was
allowed
at
the
big
people
's
table
.
i
was
six
years
old
.
my
brother
les-ten
.
and
my
sister
bonnie-fourteen
.
every
night
after
supper
we
all
gathered
around
-after
my
mom
and
us
children
cleared
the
dishes-
my
dad
read
a
chapter
or
two
each
night
.
it
was
a
time
when
life
was
perfect
.
it
was
before
any
stresses
hit
our
world.watership
down
is
about
a
young
bunny
named
fiver
who
is
a
seer
.
one
day
he
receives
a
frightening
vision
of
his
warren
's
imminent
destruction
.
when
he
and
his

hazel
fail
to
convince
their
chief
rabbit

set
out
on

i
will
just

have
been

most

watership
down
began
as
an
impromptu
entertainment
for
adams
'
two
young
daughters
on
long
car
trips
-
an
adventure
of
a
migrating
bunch
of
somewhat
anthropomorphic
but
yet
very
rabbit-like
rabbits
.
it
is
a
story
full
of
palpable
love
for
english
countryside
full
of
'rabbity
'
allegories
of
the
variations
of
human
societies
and
ideologies
that
nevertheless
do
not
overshadow
the
simple
but
fascinating
impact
of
the
story
of
survival
against
all
odds
rooted
in
friendship
bravery
loyalty
courage
quick
thinking
and
learning
ability
to
see
and
embrace
the
new
while
relying
on
the
ages-tested
old
and
perseverance
despite
the
unfavorable
odds
.
ârabbits
live
close
to
death
and
when
death
comes
closer
than
usual
thinking
about
survival
leaves
little
room
for
anything
else.â
i
first
read
the
story
of
hazel
bigwig
co.
when
i
was
twelve
and
read
it
again
and
again
many
times
since
loving
it
more
and
more
with
each
re-read
appreciating
more
and
more
each
time
how
its
seeming
simplicity
is
actually
made
of
layers
of
complexity.survival
is
the
big
theme
naturally
but
another
one
is
the
coexistence
between
the
old
ways
and
the
new
ways
the
balance
between
the
natural
and
the
'unnatural
'
innate
and
learned
.
it
's
not
just
the
rabbit
society
that
is
plagued
by
these
choices
of
course
.
on
a
superficial
read
it
would
appear
that
adams
favors
the
former
our
rabbits
are
looking
for
a
way
to
lead
the
'normal
'
natural
rabbit
life
that
sharply
contrasts
with
the
decadent
cowslip
's
warren
and
militaristic
efrafa
.
but
on
the
other
hand
it
's
precisely
the
openness
to
the
new
things
and
experiences
that
allows
hazel
's
bunch
to
survive
the
raft
and
the
boat
the
digging
of
burrows
the
interspecies
alliances
but
they
still
hold
on
firmly
to
their
essential
rabbitness
.
it
's
the
harmony
that
adams
is
looking
for
and
i
love
it.adams
succeeded
in
creating
such
vivid
and
distinct
personalities
for
all
of
the
rabbits
in
the
story
making
them
so
human-like
and
yet
unmistakably
animal
at
the
same
time
.
cute
fluffy
bunnies
they
are
not
however
they
are
tenacious
survivalists
full
of
life
force
and
determination
to
survive
despite
their
status
as
prey
for
the
'thousand
'
the
many
carnivorous
predators
from
cats
to
hawks
to
foxes
to
humans
.
they
are
driven
by
the
need
to
live
and
multiply
and
thrive
and
when
allowed
to
do
so
they
are
fearsome
indeed
-
just
think
of
how
rabbits
took
over
australia
for
example
.
in
adams
'
rendition
they
are
and
are
n't
like
us
and
it
's
both
their
similarities
and
differences
from
what
we
think
as
'human
'
that
makes
the
story
unforgettable
.
âanimals
do
n't
behave
like
men
'
he
said
.
'if
they
have
to
fight
they
fight
and
if
they
have
to
kill
they
kill
.
but
they
do
n't
sit
down
and
set
their
wits
to
work
to
devise
ways
of
spoiling
other
creatures
'
lives
and
hurting
them
.
they
have
dignity
and
animality.â
each
rabbit
has
a
distinct
voice
and
personality
-
without
being
people
they
are
nevertheless
persons
-
but
it
's
the
three
that
stand
out
to
me
hazel
bigwig
and
woundwort.hazel
the
mastermind
of
the
rabbit
adventures
is
a
natural
leader
.
he
is
not
the
fastest
the
smartest
or
the
strongest
-
but
he
has
the
understanding
of
the
strengths
and
weaknesses
of
the
ragtag
bunch
he
leads
.
he
genuinely
cares
and
his
charisma
and
leading
by
example
are
quick
to
win
the
loyalty
of
others
.
the
parallels
between
hazel
and
the
legendary
rabbit
folklore
hero
el-ahrairah
the
prince
of
a
thousand
enemies
are
not
surprising
and
the
final
scene
of
the
book
lovely
but
quietly
gut-wrenching
comes
as
no
surprise
.
``
you
need
n't
worry
about
them
''
said
his
companion
.
``
they
'll
be
all
right
--
and
thousands
like
them
.
if
you
'll
come
along
i
'll
show
you
what
i
mean
.
``
he
reached
the
top
of
the
bank
in
a
single
powerful
leap
.
hazel
followed
and
together
they
slipped
away
running
easily
down
through
the
wood
where
the
first
primroses
were
beginning
to
bloom
.
''
his
opposite
is
the
eventual
villain
of
the
book
general
woundwort
the
tyrant
leader
of
an
isolated
militaristic
rabbit
warren
a
ruler
with
an
iron
fist
whose
forceful
personality
is
supplemented
by
ferociously
merciless
teeth
and
claws
.
unlike
hazel
he
leads
by
force
and
coercion
-
but
props
to
adams
for
not
making
him
neatly
fit
into
a
black-and-white
good-vs-bad
model
as
his
amazing
ability
to
at
least
temporarily
make
rabbits
perpetual
prey
into
predators
was
a
source
of
almost
legendary
fame
.
and
yet
woundwort
's
vision
breaks
down
because
grand
as
it
may
be
it
's
still
just
tunnel
vision
.
âat
that
moment
in
the
sunset
on
watership
down
there
was
offered
to
general
woundwort
the
opportunity
to
show
whether
he
was
really
the
leader
of
vision
and
genius
which
he
believed
himself
to
be
or
whether
he
was
no
more
than
a
tyrant
with
the
courage
and
cunning
of
a
pirate
.
for
one
beat
of
his
pulse
the
lame
rabbit
's
idea
shone
clearly
before
him
.
he
grasped
it
and
realized
what
it
meant
.
the
next
he
had
pushed
it
away
from
him.â
and
bridging
the
gap
between
hazel
and
woundwort
is
my
hero
bigwig
.
big
strong
and
experienced
and
therefore
bound
to
succeed
almost
anywhere
in
the
rabbit
'society
'
he
grows
from
a
careless
and
a
bit
bullyish
character
to
one
strongly
loyal
and
just
learning
to
rely
on
brains
over
brawn
and
yet
with
enough
ferocity
and
determination
to
be
an
unstoppable
force
when
combined
with
hazel
's
leadership
.
the
warren
of
watership
down
would
have
been
doomed
without
bigwig
's
boundless
daring
loyal
courage
without
his
resolute
determination
and
willingness
for
self-sacrifice
for
the
others
-
a
trait
he
would
of
course
have
not
developed
if
not
for
the
friends
he
made
on
the
night
of
the
escape
from
the
doomed
old
warren
in
the
search
of
watership
down
promised
by
fiver
.
hazel
learns
to
see
the
strengths
and
weaknesses
in
others

learns
to

them
in
himself.my
strong

loyal
rabbit
hero
your
words
at
what
you
thought
may
have
been
your
last
minutes
never
cease
to
make
me
happily
grin
âmy
chief
rabbit
has
told
me
to
stay
and
defend
this
run
and
until
he
says
otherwise
i
shall
stay
here.â
this
book
is
wonderful
fantastic
and
has
definitely
earned
itself
a
spot
on
the
strategically
placed
bookshelf
in
my
future
hypothetical
daughter
's
room
where
it
will
serve
the
purpose
of
helping
to
bring
her
into
the
wonderful
world
of
stories
and
help
her
see
the
world
for
the
amazing
place
it
is
.
and
meanwhile
somewhere
in
the
wild
rabbits
would
quietly
go
on
with
their
rabbit
lives
.

.
``
when
fiver
a
seer
is
overcome
with
a
vivid
dream
of
mass
destruction
.
he
tries
to
convince
the
rabbits
in
charge
of
the
validity
of
his
vision
.
they
are
dismissive
but
one
rabbit
named
hazel
does
believe
him
.
they
convince
nine
other
bucks
to
leave
the
warren
with
them
.
driven
by
fear
and
curiosity
they
begin
an
odyssey
that
if
homer
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
hear
about
would
have
given
him
another
epic
story
to
tell
for
a
few
more
copper
coins
in
the
town
square
.
hazel
finds
out
he
is
a
natural
leader
and
through
courage
luck
and
macguveresque
skills
manages
to
bring
his
troop
through
the
thickets
of
a
new
and
dangerous
world
.
they
meet
other
warrens
of
rabbits
with
society
aberrations
that
made
them
unpalatable
for
amalgamation
.
given
the
way
that
richard
adams
portrayed
these
rigid
social
constructs
i
came
away
with
the
feeling
that
he
was
somewhat
anti-government
.
he
seemed
to
be
advocating
that
a
looser
structure
of
co-existence
will
lead
to
happier
rabbitspeople
.
speaking
of
that
even
though
these
rabbits
did
take
on
some
human
characteristics
i
never
really
thought
of
them
as
people
.
i
was
convinced
i
was
reading
a
book
about
rabbits
not
rabbits
with
human
faces
.
that
to
me
is
a
major
achievement
and
at
the
same
time
in
the
early
pages
made
me
feel
like
i
was
reading
a
book
at
a
reading
level
below
my
comfort
zone
.
rabbits
are
relatively
simple
animals
and
adams
adhered
to
that
principle
for
most
of
the
book
.
cleverness
was
a
revered
trait
among
warren
colonies
and
is
reflected
in
their
stories
of
past
accomplishments
by
legendary
rabbits
.
these
stories
passed
down
orally
from
generation
to
generation
provided
a
collective
source
of
cunning
skills
that
are
applied
to
situations
beyond
the
natural
experiences
of
our
erstwhile
heroes
.
it
does
n't
take
long
for
the
all
male
colony
to
realize
that
if
they
want
kittens
.
they
must
have
does
.
they
were
in
such
a
hurry
to
escape
the
warren
that
they
forgot
to
bring
the
mystical
other
half
necessary
for
reproduction
.
they
came
to
the
same
conclusion
that
tribal
units
have
come
to
for
thousands
of
years
.
if
they
do
n't
have
something
they
need
than
they
need
to
liberate
it
from
someone
else
.
the
efrafa
warren
is
governed
by
general
woundwart
.
he
is
a
brutal
militaristic
leader
who
rules
his
burrow
with
an
iron
fist
.
the
efrafa
happen
to
have
a
plethora
of
does
and
hazel
and
his
band
of
intrepid
bunnies
believe
they
are
clever
enough
with
the
help
of
some
unusual
allies
to
coax
away
enough
does
to
insure
the
survival
of
their
fledgling
society
.
this
sets
up
one
of
the
most
pulse
pounding
showdowns
i
've
read
in
a
long
time
.
displaying
the
courage
of
the
defenders
of
the
alamo
and
the
steadfastness
of
the
spartans
at
the
battle
of
thermopylae
i
found
myself
glowing
with
the
pride
of
a
participant
white
knuckles
and
all
as
the
watership
down
rabbits
defend
their
home
.
the
thing
about
this
book
is
that
you
have
to
hang
in
there
.
i
have
started
and
stopped
this
book
a
handful
of
times
but
several
reviews
on
goodreads
convinced
me
i
was
giving
up
on
the
book
too
soon
.
at
about
page
70
i
could
feel
my
eyes
looking
over
with
longing
at
the
stack
of
books
waiting
in
the
wings
.
as
the
pages
stacked
up
i
started
to
care
about
this
band
of
brothers
.
i
wish
that
i
had
read
it
in
time
to
have
shared
it
with
my
kids
.
there
is
much
to
be
discussed
especially
in
regards
to
how
societies
are
structured
about
courage
about
friendship
about
thinking
outside
the
box
and
about
the
importance
of
how
we
conduct
ourselves
within
our
own
warrentownship
.
if
you
have
kids
young
enough
read
it
to
them
.
it
will
heighten
the
experience
for
you
and
them
.
i
've
already
got
this
logged
as
a
book
to
read
to
my
grandchildren
...
some
day
...
in
the
distant
future
...
after
my
kids
graduate
college
...
get
great
jobs
...
meet
their
soulmates
...
and
have
kids
that
love
to
curl
up
in
their
grandfather
's
lap
for
a
tale
that
may
help
shape
the
people
they
become
.

whose
five

let

anna
had
a
rabbit
let

call

fluffy
.
anna
was
extremely
fond
of
fluffy
and
spent
a
lot
time
playing
with
him
feeding
him
lettuce
and
doing
other
stuff
five
year
old
girls
do
with
their
pet
rabbits.one
weekend
anna
's
family
were
going
off
for
a
day
to
visit
relatives
.
they
had
only
been
gone
an
hour
or
two
when
mary
's
little
sister
bursts
into
her
bedroom
close
to
hysterical
.
omg
omg
rover
has
killed
fluffy
mary
comes
downstairs
and
it
's
true
.
there
's
rover
looking
very
pleased
with
himself
and
there
's
fluffy
.
he
's
not
just
stone-cold
dead
but
rover
has
for
some
reason
dragged
him
home
through
the
dirt
rather
than
carrying
him
carefully
in
his
jaws
the
way
dogs
usually
do
.
he
's
a
total
mess.so
for
a
moment
both
girls
are
indeed
pretty
hysterical
but
then
mary
calms
down
.
she
can
see
a
way
out
of
this
.
they
take
fluffy
's
corpse
back
to
mary
's
room
and
get
out
a
bowl
of
warm
water
shampoo
and
a
blow-drier
.
they
do
a
pretty
good
job
of
cleaning
him
up
so
he
looks
more
or
less
presentable
.
late
at
night
they
sneak
out
with
a
flashlight
and
put
him
back
in
his
hutch
.
they
figure
that
with
a
little
luck
they
've
got
away
with
it.the
next
day
the
neighbors
come
back
.
shortly
afterwards
the
doorbell
rings
.
it
's
anna
's
father
who
looks
like
he
's
near
to
losing
it
altogether
.
at
first
he
can
hardly
speak
he
's
so
angry
and
then
he
explains
what
's
happened
.
they
were
just
going
to
leave
he
says
and
anna
had
gone
out
for
a
last
check
on
fluffy
.
she
'd
found
him
dead
and
was
predictably
heart-broken
.
despite
everything
she
'd
insisted
that
they
go
and
bury
him
properly
at
once
which
they
'd
done
.
and
then
...
while
they
were
away
...
some
bastard
some
sick
fuck
had
gone
and
dug
up
poor
fluffy
and
put
him
back
in
his
hutch
how
could
anyone
do
such
a
thingmy
friend
told
me
she
'd
looked
him
in
the
eye
and
said
she
could
n't
understand
that
either
and
it
was
the
hardest
thing
she
'd
ever
done.i
just

the
sentiment

iâm
sure
it
was
now
that
i
think
about
it
.
fathers
are
important
people.iâve
been
reading
this
book
with
my
daughter
every
night
before
bed
.
she
calls
it
the
bunny
book
.
weâve
had
lengthy
discussions
about
hazel
and
fiver
kehaar
and
bigwig
.
we
both
delighted
in
the
exploits
of
el-ahrairah
and
were
emotionally
crushed
whenever
disaster
befell
our
favorite
warren
.
to
fall
back
on
the
comfort
of
cliche
life
is
all
about
the
journey
.
the
rabbits
left
their
home
because
it
was
doomed
.
they
faced
many
obstacles
in
their
escape
but
they
view
spoiler
made
it
hide
spoiler
.
perhaps
that
night
with
the
police
was
my
escape
.
perhaps
the
nightmares
and
disappointments
were
my
journey
.
perhaps
he
was
my
general
woundwort
.
it
doesnât
really
matter
because
in
the
end
i
'm
happy
where
i
ended
up
.
iâve
got
my
girls
.
i
have
my
life.perhaps
fatherâs
day
isnât
about
celebrating
fathers
.
perhaps
itâs
a
chance
for
fathers
to
take
stock
of
what
they
have
and
celebrate
that
.
this
year
iâm
celebrating
the
bunny
book
and
those
late
nights
with
my
baby
.

i
did
not

the
impression
that

disrespected
his

's
input
in
any
way
either
.
they
were
his
first
listeners
as
all
past
and
future
readers
are
as
well
.
the
age
of
the
reader
is
moot
just
as
the
species
of
the
characters
is
.
i
found
fascinating
also
how
adams
researched
how
rabbits
really
behave
to
keep
it
as
close
to
their
true
natures
as
possible
.

again.i
feel
the
point
of
those
efforts
was
dignity
.
one
of
the
many
things
that
watership
down
is
about
is
the
right
to
live
with
dignity
.
are
n't
some
things
what
everyone
could
still
use
at
any
time
what
is
too
much
to
pay
for
freedom
what
is
the
cost
of
ignoring
atrocities
because
it
makes
things
easier
for
you
sounds
like
world
affairs
for
like
always
love
brotherhood
government
spirituality
what
you
need
to
hold
on
adventure
watership
down
is
also
one
of
my
favorite
adventure
stories
self
respect
.
if
you
care
about
the
essentials
for
another
then
how
can
watership
down
only
be
for
one
thing
how
is
giving
a
shit
for
kids
onlyi
'm
not
sure
why
the
kid
statements
bother
me
other
than
just
being
wrong
.
maybe
i
feel
it
is
meant
to
take
away
dignity
from

adams
credits
him
as
the
person
who
helped
give
the
book
its
title
apparently
he
thought
that
hazel
fiver
did
n't
do
it
justice
.
everything
seemed
to
suggest
that
the
whole
affair
would
be
an
abject
failure
.
watership
down
was
a
debut
work
by
an
unknown
novelist
published
at
a
high
price
by
a
small
fry
who
could
afford
only
a
plain
dust
jacket
.
collings
published
his
books
in
small
print
runs
which
were
then
sold
in
specialist
bookshops
with
little
or
no
publicity
and
the
initial
print
run
of
watership
down
amounted
to
just
2000
copies
.
but
this
seemingly
ugly
duckling
soon
transformed
into
a
beautiful
swan
it
sold
quickly
both
to
children
and
adults
.
britain
fell
in
love
with
watership
down
and
with
time
so
did
the
whole
world
.
now
tourists
from
as
far
as
japan
journeying
to
richard
adam
's
homeland
to
see
the
areas
which
inspired
their
favorite
book
.
the
quotation
which
opens
this
review
comes
from
london
's
the
times
where
the
reviewer
was
barely
able
to
contain
his
enthusiasm
.
watership
down
originally
began
as
a
serial
bedtime
story
told
by
richard
adams
to
his
two
little
girls
juliet
and
rosamund
.
adams
later
expanded
it
during
long
car
journeys
that
he
took
with
the
girls
to
stratford-upon-avon
birthplace
of
the
world
's
most
famous
bard
.
the
story
was
improvised
but
based
on
adams
's
real
life
experience
in
the
british
army
.
adams
served
as
a
lieutenant
in
the
250
company
of
the
1st
airborne
division
and
named
the
battle
of
arnhem
as
inspiration
and
the
officers
he
served
with
as
models
for
hazel
bigwig
and
other
rabbits
of
watership
down
.
when
the
story
was
finished
young
juliet
said
``
you
ought
to
write
it
down
daddy
it
's
too
good
to
waste
''
.
although
adams
initially
resisted
being
busy
with
work
in
the
civil
service
she
and
her
sister
were
very
persistent
in
urging
him
to
write
it
as
a
book
until
he
finally
surrendered
and
then
urged
him
to
get
it
published
.
watership
down
is
rightfully
dedicated
to
these
two
girls
who
were
so
generous
as
to
make
sure
that
their
dad
would
share
the
story
they
loved
with
the
whole
world.watership
down
was
initially
rejected
on
the
grounds
that
older
children
would
n't
like
it
since
it
was
about
rabbits
-
which
they
thought
was
good
for
babies
and
younger
children
would
n't
like
it
because
it
was
written
in
too
adult
a
style
.
before
rex
collings
decided
to
give
it
a
try
richard
adams
experienced
plenty
of
frustration
with
explaining
that
he
did
n't
even
had
children
in
mind
and
that
watership
down
was
really
about
hazel
fiver
and
their
rabbits
a
book
which
anyone
young
or
old
could
buy
and
enjoy
and
that
the
age
group
of
his
audience
could
roughly
be
contained
between
8
and
88
.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
watership
down
is
sold
also
as
a
children
's
book
only
in
the
uk
-
everywhere
else
in
the
world
it
's
sold
purely
as
a
mainstream
title
for
adults
.

rabbits
are
prey
animals
and
in
the
wilderness
almost
everything
will
try
to
capture
and
eat
them
predators
include
foxes
dogs
hawks
racoons
owls
snakes
-
and
humans
.
luckily
for
them
nature
has
provided
the
rabbit
with
several
features
allowing
for
survival
against
these
odds
.
rabbits
have
eyes
on
both
sides
of
their
heads
which
give
them
nearly
panoramic
vision
allowing
for
detecting
predators
from
all
directions
-
even
from
behind
.
they
can
hear
and
smell
exceptionally
well
and
are
able
to
turn
their
ears
to
better
capture
the
sounds
they
're
listening
to
.
since
making
noises
is
a
dead
giveaway
of
their
position
rabbits
communicate
with
each
other
quietly
with
the
position
of
their
ears
being
an
important
part
of
the
rabbit
language.as
useful
as
these
may
be
rabbits
can
not
survive
on
sight
smell
and
hearing
alone
.
and
this
is
why
nature
has
endowed
the
rabbit
with
its
best
feature
-
ability
to
achieve
amazing
speed
very
quickly
.
most
of
their
mass
consists
of
muscle
and
their
strength
is
focused
in
their
long
hind
legs
-
they
allow
them
to
leap
as
high
as
one
meter
and
as
far
as
three
.
an
average
rabbit
can
run
between
25
to
40
miles
per
hour
make
quick
turns
and
even
turn
directions
while
in
the
air
leaving
other
animals
in
the
dust.however
even
this
magnificent
speed
is
not
enough
to
protect
the
rabbit
.
due
to
their
low
skeletal
mass
rabbits
are
very
delicate
and
prone
to
injury
and
can
easily
break
their
own
bones
if
they
struggle
.
if
they
kick
to
hard
they
can
even
break
their
own
backs
.
stress
can
have
a
long
lasting
effect
on
a
rabbit
even
after
its
source
is
removed
-
and
fear
can
cause
a
heart
attack
even
if
the
threat
is
not
real
.
their
physical
and
psychological
fragility
and
proneness
to
being
preyed
upon
made
the
rabbit
need
a
safe
place
to
live
.
some
species
live
above
ground
but
the
best
know
one
-
the
european
rabbit
-
digs
burrows
underground
and
connects
them
into
a
network
which
is
called
a
warren
.
in
these
warrens
rabbits
find
safe
shelter
from
their
predators
and
harsh
weather
store
food
and
have
their
young
.
when
they
're
not
feeding
european
rabbits
spend
most
of
their
time
underground.the
rabbits
of
watership
down
are
very
much
like
ordinary
rabbits
-
richard
adams
has
studied
ronald
lockley
the
private
life
of
the
rabbit
-
but
at
the
same
time
they
're
human
like
with
each
having
a
distinct
personality
and
different
characteristics
.
while
adams
clearly
anthropomorphizes
his
bunnies
he
does
n't
go
the
easy
way
of
making
them
humans
in
bunny
suits
.
his
rabbits
'
understanding
of
the
world
around
them
is
carefully
limited
to
make
them
lapine
enough
-
men
are
identified
by
the
``
white
sticks
''
they
leave
behind
almost
every
human
character
in
the
novel
smokes
-
it
were
the
70
's
.
human
inventions
are
understood
through
the
mind
of
a
rabbit
and
the
challenges
they
experience
on
their
way
are
also
of
the
type
which
would
trouble
one
.
all
of
it
works
splendidly
though
and
the
language
that
the
rabbits
developed
to
describe
everything
is
a
small
joy
to
see.among
many
things
which
i
found
lovable
and
admirable
in
the
rabbit
protagonists
of
watership
down
is
their
love
of
stories
.
rabbits
love
gathering
together
and
listening
to
the
tales
of
the
legendary
rabbit
hero
their
beloved
el-ahrairah
.
el-ahrairah
was
a
rabbit
trickster
and
the
legendary
prince
of
the
forest
who
lived
long
before
hazel
fiver
and
the
rest
of
all
rabbits
.
together
with
his
fellow
rascal
rabscutle
el-ahrairah
uses
his
ample
wits
to
commit
plenty
of
mischief
getting
lettuce
out
of
an
impenetrable
fortress
outsmarting
bigger
and
stronger
creatures
to
achieve
his
goals
.
el-ahrairah
is
fast
cunning
and
proud
but
he
's
also
honorable
and
loyal
to
his
people
.
the
stories
of
el-ahrairah
and
his
adventures
are
sprinkled
throughout
the
main
narrative
and
serve
as
inspiration
and
entertainment
for
the
rabbits
and
as
a
way
to
find
courage
in
hard
times.a
reviewer
in
the
new
statesman
praised
richard
adams
for
writing
a
big
tense
picaresque
story
these
three
adjectives
probably
best
describe
watership
down
.
people
have
seen
in
it
a
riff
on
the
oddysey
an
allegory
for
human
struggle
against
totalitarian
oppression
fascism
the
cold
war
...
but
at
its
heart
it
is
a
wonderful
story
about
a
group
of
rabbits
searching
for
a
new
home
and
their
efforts
at
establishing
a
warren
.
they
provide
for
interesting
protagonists
and
as
they
journey
goes
on
so
do
their
respective
roles
develop
.
these
are
to
a
degree
archetypal
but
richard
adams
is
careful
to
make
sure
that
each
rabbit
retains
its
individual
characteristics
and
grow
as
the
story
progresses
.
relations
between
the
characters
are
not
black
and
white
as
in
many
books
for
children
-
even
though
the
villain
figure
is
portrayed
with
obvious
negativity
adams
makes
an
effort
to
show
why
it
would
be
influential
and
admired
by
many
other
rabbits
all
the
way
to
the
very
end
.
occasionally
adams
will
do
some
authorial
intrusion
and
explain
the
rabbit
habits
of
his
protagonists
but
he
did
write
this
book
based
on
the
stories
he
told
their
kids
and
they
probably
asked
many
questions
concerning
these
matters
-
as
most
kids
would
.
it
's
not
a
big
problem
at
all
and
can
actually
be
seen
a
nice
reminded
about
the
roots
of
watership
down.it
feels
as
if
i
have
been
writing
this
review
for
a
very
long
time
and
have
barely
said
anything
i
wanted
to
say
.
this
happens
when
i
encounter
something
which
moves
me
and
inspires
me
and
which
stays
with
me
and
makes
me
experience
and
think
and
feel
my
humanity
by
doing
so
.
curiously
these
feelings
have
been
aroused
by
a
book
about
a
group
of
talking
rabbits
.
but
it
works
by
god
people
it
works
.
since
it
's
summer
i
started
to
enjoy
reading
in
a
park
near
my
home
just
sitting
on
a
bench
away
from
the
main
lane
in
the
quiet
and
the
shade
.
this
was
where
i
started
and
finished
watership
down
and
after
i
cleaned
my
eyes
i
wanted
to
immediately
begin
it
all
over
again
.
i
ca
n't
remember
the
last
time
that
happened
and
it
's
a
great
feeling
.
i
ca
n't
wait
to
run
down
this
burrow
again
and
see
what
else
i
'll
find
there.praise
be
to
richard
adams
for
being
a
wonderful
father
to
his
two
little
girls
and
a
great
writer
who
shared
his
beautiful
book
with
us
.
5
stars.be
sure
not
to
miss
an
interview
with
richard
adams
which
made
me
like
and
appreciate
watership
down
even
more
and
want
to
seek
out
all
his
other
works
.
it
was
filmed
in
november
2012
at
whitchurch
arts
show
in
the
uk
where
he
's
rocking
the
house
at
the
age
of
92
.
what
a
wonderful
and
lovable
man
may
he
live
a
thousand
years
.

hide
spoiler
i
did
n't
really
think
so
.
it
seemed
like
it
had
been
too
easy
and
anticlimactic
.
there
were
no
female
characters
.
i
also
felt
that
the
theme
of
human
impact
being
negative
and
destructive
was
a
little
too
easy
novelists
now
as
then
have
their
environmental
impact
as
do
we
all
.
it
's
easy
to
suggest
that
humans
are
degrading
their
environment
harder
to
say
what
should
be
done
about
it
given
that
we
are
all
complicit
in
it
-
and
adams
makes
no
effort
at
all
in
that
direction.little
did
i
suspect
that
this
was
just
the
pre-amble
to
a
tremendous
adventure
in
which
this
theme
would
be
dropped
almost
entirely
and
the
focus
would
shift
toward
questions
of
leadership
governance
and
the
will
to
power
.
or
that
the
lack
of
female
rabbits
would
turn
out
to
be
crucial
to
what
was
going
to
happen
next.now
a
bunch
of
talking
rabbits
should
really
be
laughable
but
they
really
are
n't
.
how
does
adams
acheive
this
partly
by
creating
convincing
characters
something
that
is
of
course
crucial
to
the
success
of
any
novel
but
that
does
n't
resolve
the
absurdity
of
talking
rabbits
.
one
method
adopted
by
adams
is
to
remember
that
they
are
rabbits
not
just
metamorphosed
humans
which
one
might
think
would
be
counter-productive
but
turns
out
not
to
be
.
so
these
rabbits
behave
like
rabbits
and
where
human
cultural
attitudes
conflict
with
the
general
behaviour
of
rabbits
rabbit
behaviour
is
kept
.
rabbit
behaviour
is
also
described
in
detail
from
a
position
of
knowledge
.
but
here
's
what
makes
the
whole
thing
really
work
the
rabbits
have
a
language
folk-tales
myths
legends
and
religion
all
their
own
.
the
floaty
black
rabbit
from
the
film
symbolises
death
and
in
the
book
is
a
good
deal
less
floaty
more
corporeal
and
even
more
scary
.
this
does
n't
stop
the
vaguely
promethean
ancestor-father-trickster-rabbit
of
rabbit
legend
taking
him
on
thoughthis
matter
of
a
society
having
history
that
merges
into
myth
and
legend
language
that
is
convincingly
represented
religious
or
spiritual
elements
to
its
culture
seems
to
me
to
be
a
common
factor
linking
the
best
works
of
fantasy
and
what
is
more
fantastical
than
a
bunch
of
talking
bunnies
.
people
talk
about
world-building
in
relation
to
fantasy
and
sf
.
i
would
suggest
that
these
aspects
of
the
world
to
be
built
are
crucial.the
rabbit-language
is
so
well
handled
that
when
bigwig
tells
his
nemesis
to
``
silflay
hraka
''
it
has
all
the
offensive
force
of
any
crude
one-liner
a
hollywood
action
star
has
ever
delivered
and
suits
the
moment
perfectly
.
was
that
in
the
film
i
ca
n't
remember
but
it
should
be
this
happens
during
a
denouement
that
has
several
perfect
moments
and
becomes
another
folk-tale
added
to
the
rich
store
of
stories
kept
in
the
warrens
of
the
lapines.so
the
wobbly
start
of
parts
1
and
2
turns
out
in
part
to
be
well
thought
out
and
necessary
for
what
comes
later
and
in
part
just
forgetable
once
stuck
into
the
drama
of
parts
3
and
4
where
even
the
humans
turn
out
to
be
not
all
bad
after
all
.

i

books
i

and
i
have
read
books
by
joe
abercrombie
and
george
r.r
.
martin
.
more
importantly
this
is
simply
one
of
the
all
time
great
reads
in
my
humble
estimation
of
course
that
will
stay
with
the
readers
for
the
rest
of
their
days
.
why
i
have
a
memory
like
a
sieve
and
i
still
remember
it
after
all
these
years
ok
i
have
just
reread
it
so
that
helps
it
all
starts
with
a
psychic
bunny
stop
laughing
back
there
called
fiver
who
has
a
vague
premonition
of
impending
death
and
destruction
coming
to
his
warren
.
he
convinces
his
best
friend
hazel
and
a
few
other
rabbits
to
leave
the
warren
for
a
safer
place
to
live
their
attempt
to
start
a
total
evacuation
is
quickly
nixed
by
the
chief
rabbit
.
the
first
half
of
the
book
tells
the
story
of
the
rabbit
motley
crewâs
or
mãtley
crã¼e
if
you
prefer
difficult
journey
from
their
warren
to
find
a
safe
location
to
start
a
new
warren
.
the
second
half
is
about
their
defence
of
their
new
warren
against
an
older
bigger
warren
ruled
by
a
despotic
dictator
called
woundwort
who
is
something
of
a
monstrous
mutant
mega
rabbit
.
interspersed
between
the
chapters
are
charming
and
wonderful
folk
tales
about
the
adventures
of
a
legendary
hero
called
el-ahrairah.plot
world
building
and
characterisation
are
brilliantly
balanced
in
this
book
.
even
at
almost
500
pages
there
is
never
a
dull
moment
.
those
looking
for
action
adventures
should
really
check
out
this
book
.
there
are
hair
raising
chase
scenes
espionage
scenes
interspecies
alliances
and
a
bloody
fight
scene
that
should
be
read
with
survivorâs
``
eye
of
the
tiger
''
playing
in
the
background
.
on
the
characterisation
side
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
rabbits
in
this
book
are
not
anthropomorphized
animals
they
do
not
wear
clothes
drive
cars
watch
tv
etc
.
yet
there
is
also
much
humanity
in
their
rabbitry
they
can
be
compassionate
loving
kind
cruel
egotistical
melancholy
etc
.
these
humans
traits
are
believably
portrayed
as
rabbit
traits
through
the
incredible
talent
of
richard
adams
.
the
prose
is
absolutely
beautiful
with
wonderful
metaphors
like
âan
indestructible
flood
of
rabbitryâ
.
i
can
pick
a
great
passage
out
of
almost
every
page
.
here
is
one
awe-inspiring
example
many
human
beings
say
that
they
enjoy
the
winter
but
what
they
really
enjoy
is
feeling
proof
against
it
.
for
them
there
is
no
winter
food
problem
.
they
have
fires
and
warm
clothes
.
the
winter
can
not
hurt
them
and
therefore
increases
their
sense
of
cleverness
and
security
.
for
birds
and
animals
as
for
poor
men
winter
is
another
matter
.
to
further
distinguish
rabbits
from
other
species
a
little
neologism
is
employed
throughout
the
book
most
of
the
words
can
be
understood
from
the
context
they
are
used
if
you
want
some
extra
help
with
these
you
can
check
out
this
lapine_glossary
.
you
can
even
gloss
over
them
without
missing
a
beat
of
the
book.reading
this
book
is
a
little
like
taking
a
magic
potion
and
transforming
into
a
wee
rabbit
.
i
am
not
normally
all
that
interested
in
cute
animals
but
after
reading
this
book
i
really
developed
a
huge
respect
for
these
little
guys
the
odds
are
really
stacked
against
them
yet
they
manage
to
survive
and
even
thrive
.
even
though
the
book
was
written
primarily
for
children
it
is
certainly
sophisticated
enough
to
be
enjoyed
by
adults
.
i
certainly
prefer
it
to
all
the
ya
books
i
have
read.definitely
worth
more
stars
than
the
goodreads
system
can
accommodate
.

even

i
said
yes
immediately
and
then
asked
her
what
book
.
âwhy
watership
down
of
courseâ
i
was
filled
with
joy
.
this
book
has
been
on
my
tbr
list
for
too
long
to
think
about
and
it
has
been
mentioned
more
times
by
stephen
king
than
his
own
books
he
constantly
makes
references
to
it
and
iâm
always
left
feeling
like
i
am
missing
a
piece
of
the
puzzle
.
it
took
us
a
while
to
get
around
to
reading
it
but
we
finally
did
.
i
decided
to
listen
to
this
on
audio
.
best
.
decision
.
ever
.
you
see
in
rabbit
lore
they
love
to
tell
stories
.
they
sit
around
and
tell
their
best
or
most
adored
stories
to
one
another
in
times
of
need
.
what
is
it
that
they
need
comfort
of
course
when
they
feel
scared
nervous
tired
or
homesick
they
perk
their
ears
up
and
sit
quietly
by
as
one
of
their
own
tells
a
story
.
listening
to
watership
down
was
an
experience
all
on
its
own
one
that
i
will
never
forget.let
me
introduce
you
to
fiver
.
heâs
a
wee
little
rabbit
who
gets
overlooked
in
an
overwhelming
warren
.
heâs
very
nervous
and
has
these
premonitions
that
he
can
not
control
.
so
one
day
he
hops
on
over
to
his
brother
hazel
and
tells
him
âsomething
bad
is
headed
this
way
.
we
must
leave
at
once.â
there
are
rules
and
a
system
of
hierarchy
that
prevent
them
from
doing
just
that
.
they
must
take
appropriate
actions
in
order
to
get
the
other
bunnies
to
safety
.
when
the
leaders
of
the
warren
ignore
him
hazel
and
fiver
decide
to
warn
as
many
of
the
other
bunnies
as
they
can
so
that
they
can
band
together
and
head
to
safer
territory
.
now
let
me
introduce
you
to
hazel
.
someone
once
said
that
the
best
leaders
are
the
ones
who
donât
ask
for
it
or
even
want
it
.
hazel
is
a
prime
example
of
that
.
hazel
is
unsure
of
his
standing
among
his
peers
and
second
guesses
himself
while
making
decisions
that
he
thinks
will
help
his
comrades
.
he
never
thinks
of
himself
as
their
leader
but
as
one
of
them
and
that
is
precisiely
what
makes
him
such
a
great
leader
and
character.i
was
very
nervous
about
how
the
bunnies
would
survive
once
they
left
the
safety
of
their
former
warren
.
they
were
off
on
an
adventure
where
they
knew
not
what
they
would
face
a
blind
journey
into
the
face
of
the
unknown
.
iâve
clearly
read
too
many
horror
novels
because
i
found
myself
holding
my
breath
every
time
the
bunnies
faced
a
new
challenge
.
i
was
waiting
for
the
other
shoe
to
dropâon
the
head
of
one
of
the
bunnies
crushing
the
poor
unknowing
soul
.
delee
tried
her
best
to
keep
reassuring
me
that
everything
would
be
okay-
and
i
must
say
she
was
right
.
i
survived.i
canât
express
how
much
i
truly
loved
this
book
.
i
am
giving
it
4.5
out
of
5
stars
.
it
was
a
beautifully
written
tale
that
i
know
i
will
revisit
time
and
time
again
.
the
audio
was
impeccable
and
i
strongly
recommend
that
version
of
it
.
there
were
only
a
couple
parts
that
i
thought
were
confusingmisleading
which
may
or
may
not
be
my
own
fault
so
i
only
took
off
a
half
star
from
the
rating.i
can
not
thank
you
enough
delee
for
sharing
your
favorite
story
with
me
.
itâs
the
greatest
gift
a
friend
can
give
.

these
critters
have
managed
to
burrow
their
way
into
my
heart
and
will
probably
remain
hidden
there
for
a
long
time.it
took
me
a
really
long
time
to
actually
start
on
the
book
.
it
was
n't
on
any
of
my
school
curriculums
and
even
after
i
discovered
in
1990
that
richard
adams
is
a
great
storyteller
i
could
n't
see
how
a
novel
about
a
bunch
of
rabbits
could
compete
with
the
bloody
tale
of
a
giant
bear
being
worshipped
as
god
shardik
or
with
the
spicy
decadent
allure
of
a
fifteen
year
old
prostitute
maya
.
a
couple
of
recent
authors
catherynne
valente
neil
gaiman
charles
de
lint
have
been
a
real
help
in
my
reassessment
of
the
power
of
myths
and
fairytales
and
given
me
the
final
push
towards
this
lapine
version
of
the
aeneidhere
's
the
quote
from
de
lint
that
explains
some
of
the
importance
and
fascination
with
the
fables
of
el-ahrairah
-
the
trickster
folk
hero
of
the
rabbit
world
who
cleverly
turns
every
misfortune
into
an
opportunity
and
who
guides
his
people
through
a
world
filled
with
a
thousand
enemies
.
he
's
loki
anansi
robin
hood
and
bugs
bunny
rolled
into
one
and
the
tales
of
his
exploits
are
not
just
a
pleasant
way
of
spending
a
quiet
evening
but
the
source
of
courage
and
determination
and
wisdom
that
will
give
hazel
and
his
warren
on
watership
down
their
chance
to
survive
predators
on
two
or
four
legs
.
âpeople
whoâve
never
read
fairy
tales
have
a
harder
time
coping
in
life
than
the
people
who
have
.
they
donât
have
access
to
all
the
lessons
that
can
be
learned
from
the
journeys
through
the
dark
woods
and
the
kindness
of
strangers
treated
decently
the
knowledge
that
can
be
gained
from
the
company
and
example
of
donkeyskins
and
cats
wearing
boots
and
steadfast
tin
soldiers
.
iâm
not
talking
about
in-your-face
lessons
but
more
subtle
ones
.
the
kind
that
seep
up
from
your
subconscious
and
give
you
moral
and
humane
structures
for
your
life
.
that
teach
you
how
to
prevail
and
trust
.
and
maybe
even
love.â
i
do
n't
want
to
get
into
a
detailed
description
of
the
plot
and
of
each
character
.
the
reference
to
the
aeneid
is
not
gratuitous
as
the
heroes
have
to
survive
the
destruction
of
their
original
home
troy
heed
prescient
oracles
of
doom
fiver
as
cassandra
travel
to
the
edges
of
the
known
world
battling
imposssible
odds
kidnap
some
wifes
for
their
male
dominated
group
the
romans
and
the
sabines
and
finish
with
an
epic
battle
against
a
superior
force
.
the
rabbits
are
individualized
not
so
much
by
their
physical
atributes
as
by
their
character
traits
-
courage
wisdom
steadfastness
inventiveness
etc
.
this
makes
it
easier
to
anthropomorphise
and
identify
with
their
plight
.
more
than
anything
else
in
the
novel
i
liked
the
companionship
and
the
readiness
for
self-sacrifice
in
the
interest
of
the
group
each
rabbit
doing
his
small
part
according
to
his
abilities
and
depending
on
the
others
in
time
of
need
-
a
social
grace
that
is
endangered
in
the
age
of
the
atomic
family
and
with
more
and
more
people
living
single
and
isolated
in
their
cubbyholes
or
in
front
of
tv
and
computer
screens
.
'wisdom
is
found
on
the
desolate
hillside
el-ahrairah
where
none
comes
to
feed
and
the
stony
bank
where
the
rabbit
scratches
a
hole
in
vain
.
the
theme
of
growing
up
through
dealing
with
adversity
is
central
to
the
story
with
equally
interesting
developments
about
the
nature
of
leadership
hazel
vs.
general
woundwort
and
the
danger
of
sacrificing
personal
freedom
for
security
the
social
structures
at
elfafa
vs
watership
down
.
these
lessons
are
not
put
down
in
speeches
or
lengthy
disertations
but
are
extracted
from
the
actions
of
the
actors
and
the
results
of
these
actions
.
adams
is
a
firm
believer
in
the
'show
do
n't
tell
'
school
of
writing
in
the
oral
traditions
of
storytelling
handed
down
from
prehistoric
time
.
the
book
has
a
lively
pace
and
a
well
graded
racketing
up
of
dramatic
tension
.
i
finished
the
book
in
almost
record
time
between
day
job
and
evening
housework
staying
up
late
into
the
night
for
one
chapter
after
another.finally
a
few
words
about
the
setting
.
south-central
england
is
where
richard
adams
grew
up
and
all
the
places
described
here
can
be
identified
on
a
map
and
visited
.
i
wish
i
could
name
every
hedge
flower
and
every
bird
and
insect
that
i
meet
on
my
country
walks
as
well
as
adams
does
describe
the
weather
and
the
sounds
and
the
smells
as
well
he
does
here
and
study
the
habits
of
the
wildlife
with
as
much
dedication
.
the
wonders
of
nature
are
part
of
the
thrill
of
the
journey
just
as
much
as
the
more
picaresque
adventures
of
the
small
and
furry
heroes
.

four-footed
protagonists
in
literature
have
been
little
more
than
humans
with
fur
.
think
stuart
little
or
redwall
.
but
adams
takes
a
very
different
tack
which
is
evident
from
the
get-go
.
the
tale
begins
with
two
young
rabbits
named
hazel
and
fiver
living
in
a
peaceful
warren
ruled
by
an
old
veteran
named
the
threarah
.
scrawny
meditative
fiver
has
premonitions
of
doom
falling
on
them
all
a
doom
that
will
stain
the
fields
with
rabbit
blood
.
but
when
the
threarah
ignores
fiverâs
counsel
hazel
decides
to
rouse
anyone
he
can
and
flee
.
the
two
are
joined
by
bigwig
a
massive
bruiser
once
part
of
the
threarahâs
personal
guard
dandelion
a
storyteller
par
excellence
blackberry
the
smart-as-a-whip
innovator
and
pipkin
a
loyal
but
timid
runt
.
when
the
threarahâs
minions
discover
their
plans
the
motley
crew
must
plunge
into
the
wilds
under
threat
of
death.adamsâ
break
with
disney-esque
anthropomorphizing
becomes
even
more
apparent
in
the
culture
he
created
for
his
rabbits
.
much
like
tolkien
did
in
the
lord
of
the
rings
adams
created
a
language
with
its
own
detailed
grammar
and
vocabulary
.
an
example
fiverâs
true
name
hrairoo
comes
from
hrair
the
term
for
any
number
over
four
which
is
how
high
rabbits
can
count
.
they
call
these
greater
sums
``
thousand
''
and
fiver
's
name
literally
means
``
little
thousand
.
''
he
was
so
christened
because
he
was
small
and
one
of
the
last
born
in
his
litter
.
other
words
that
crop
up
--
including
elil
âpredatorsâ
silflay
âto
grazeâ
and
narn
âsomething
good
to
eatâ
--
possess
equally
detailed
explanations
.
frith
the
word
for
the
sun
is
particularly
interesting
since
it
contains
religious
connotations
.
the
rabbits
you
see
are
sun
worshippers
.
they
adore
lord
frith
and
the
first
rabbit
he
created
el-ahrairah
whose
mischievous
exploits
get
recounted
several
times
in
detail
and
who
would
put
odysseus
to
shame
with
his
inventiveness.part
of
the
joy
of
reading
watership
down
lies
in
not
only
in
its
mythological
color
but
in
letting
yourself
be
carried
along
by
every
twist
and
turn
of
the
plot
which
is
half
adventure
and
half
thriller
with
a
smattering
of
british
botany
warren
geography
and
seagull
dialect
thrown
in
to
keep
things
interesting
.
if
you
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
it
could
be
a
coherent
read
with
so
many
disparate
elements
much
less
an
entertaining
one
join
the
crowd
.
it
took
months
of
nagging
from
a
friend
to
get
me
to
crack
its
cover
.
but
it
most
certainly
works
which
is
a
testimony
to
adamsâ
skill
as
is
the
fact
that
when
you
reach
the
final
page
youâve
begun
to
feel
that
hazel
and
his
friends
are
every
bit
as
courageous
as
achilles
or
aeneas
--
no
matter
the
length
of
their
ears

bunch
of
rabbits
move
from
one
field
to
another
...
wow
what
an
adventure
...
it
's
actually
pretty
thrilling
.
a

crazy

has
visions
of
a
rabbit

awash
in
blood
and
strange
monsters
machines
attacking
the
land
.
a

along
the
way
they
fall
in
with
and
are
tempted
by
a

other
tribes
of
bunnies
each
twisted
in
its
own
weird
way
including
the
common
trope
of
the
false
paradise
where
everything
is
apparently
``
taken
care

''
for
the
rabbits
by
mysterious
outside
forces
which
justin
cronin
totally
ripped
off
in
the
passage
before
they
eventually
determine
to
start
anew
.
woven
throughout
is
a
whole
language
and
mythology
for
the
rabbits
including
a
sort
of
creation
myth
that
i
always
found
a
little
boring
when
i
was
younger
but
appreciated
more
when
i
picked
it
up
a
few
years
ago
--
they
give
the
proceedings
an
additional
layer
of
allegory
and
keep
it
from
being
just
a

story
which
do
n't
get
me
wrong
it
still
mostly
is.because
yes
it
does
work
on
an
allegorical
level
but
it
's
really
only
worth
analyzing
as
such
if
you

the

are
pretty
obvious

people
keep

finding
this
review
and
balking
at
it
let
me
just
say
that
i
found
the
book
to
be
beautifully
written
.
however
i
just
did
n't
find
any
characters
i
particularly
cared
for
and
the
storyline
just
was
n't
interesting
to
me
.
i
watched
the
movie
just
to
see
if
it
would
be
worth
it
to
read
the
book
and
i
had
the
same
reaction
.
it
just
was
n't
interesting
.
i
'm
not
a
big
fan
of
journey-type
narratives
or
anthropomorphic
stories
.
i
'm
a
prolific
reader
of
everything
from
classics
to
sci-fi
.
i
read
a
lot
of
children
's
literature
.
i
taught
american
literature
for
10
years
.
and
i
also
know
what
i
like
and
what
i
do
n't
.
this
just
happens
to
be
a
book
that
does
n't
appeal
to
me
.
perhaps
it
speaks
to
you
.
every
book
is
different
for
every
person
.
every
person
brings
in
different
experiences
that
allows
a
book
to
speak
to
them
in
a
different
way
.
if
we
all
liked
the
same
things
the
world
would
be
a
terribly
boring
place
.
my
feelings
toward
this
book
should
not
be
a
personal
affront
to
you
who
counts
it
among
your
favorites
.
my
one
star
is
personal
and
has
little
to
do
with
the
author
's
ability
to
write
or
others
'
possibility
of
liking
it
.
one
star
simply
means
that
it
does
n't
appeal
to
me
in
the
least
.
calm
down
and
move
on

seriously.in
creating
a

nothing

interestingly
this
is
a
lean

devoid
of
unnecessarily
intricate
machinations

details
reflective
of
authorial
indulgence
.
the
characters
are
each

richly
drawn

refreshingly
free

there
are
heroes

villains
to
be
sure
--
''
good
''

``
bad
''
rabbits
as
well
as
other
animated
creatures
--
but
none
lack
depth
or
interest
none
descend
into
parody
.
the
storytelling
pace
furthermore
is
brisk
consistent
always
thrilling
.
in
short
i
without
reservation
recommend
this
book
to
that
broadest
of
all
demographic
groupings
children

've

been
curious
about
the
book
and
for
reasons
unknowable
to
me
i
just
recently
got
around
to
picking
it
up
.
based
on
my
memories
of
the
film
version
i
was
expecting
game
of
thrones
with
rabbits
.
i
was
expecting
a
relentless
parade
of
death
and
despair
.
this
is
n't
what
i
got
.
yes
this
is
a
mature
book
and
it
is
realistic
and
honest
about
the
rabbit
's
place
in
the
world
and
it
certainly
does
n't
shy
away
from
the
realities
of
their
place
in
the
food
chain
.
but
i
was
expecting
crushing
tragedy
after
crushing
tragedy
and
what
i
got
was
a
much
more
balanced
depiction
of
the
rabbit
's
life
.
i
was
n't
disappointed
that
my
expectations
did
n't
match
this
book
's
contents.this
was
a
slower
read
for
me
.
but
this
i
have
to
admit
can
be
at
least
in
part
attributed
to
the
circumstances
surrounding
my
reading
of
the
book
.
i
was
extremely
busy
while
reading
this
and
the
only
time
i
had
to
read
was
just
before
bed
.
the
book
did
n't
keep
me
up
.
i
was
out
in
under
fifteen
minutes
almost
every
night
after
the
old
kindle
slapped
me
in
the
face
multiple
times
as
i
nodded
off
.
but
structurally
it
did
n't
feel
like
a
novel
.
it
felt
like
a
collection
of
interconnected
stories
or
a
fix-up
until
about
the
halfway
mark
when
we
're
at
long
last
introduced
to
the
book
's
central
conflict
.
another
aspect
of
the
book
that
slowed
it
down
for
me
was
the
stories
within
the
story
about
rabbit
folklore
.
these
stories
in
themselves
i
found
entertaining
but
they
did
kill
the
momentum
for
me
every
time.overall
i
enjoyed
this
book
a
great
deal
and
i
think
it
will
be
one
that
will
stick
in
my
memory
for
years
to
come
.
it
's
a
rich
book
with
a
layered
narrative
.
there
are
beautiful
passages
sprinkled
throughout
.
an
obvious
respect
for
nature
and
a
passion
for
nature
's
beauty
serves
as
a
nice
contrast
to
the
harrowing
events
of
the
story
.
the
narrative
is
at
first
biblical
in
tone
then
dystopian
.
it
veers
suddenly
into
a
heist
story
returns
again
to
dystopian
mode
and
finally
settles
into
a
tale
of
all-out
resource
war
.
sprinkled
between
all
of
these
shifts
in
narrative
structure
there
are
stories
within
the
main
story
stories
told
between
rabbits
their
creation
myths
tall
tales
of
their
legendary
heroes
stories
of
what
lies
beyond
death
and
the
black
rabbit
who
is
waiting
there
to
greet
all
rabbits
when
they
stop
running.i
'd
certainly
recommend
this
book
.
however
know
that
this
is
one
to
be
sipped
not
gulped
.

i

the

i
guess
that
in
a
story
about
a
bunch
of
rabbits
it
could
be
easy
to
mistake
one
for
the
other
.
not
in
this
book
.
each
of
the
main
rabbits
has
a
distinct
character
and
throughout
the
book
i
found
that
i
actually
really
cared
about
them
.
i
ca
n't
really
say
much
more
about
the
characters
without
giving
the
storyline
away
but
suffice
to
say
that
it
was
a
rollercoaster
of
emotions.the
story
carries
deeper
meaning
than
just
a
story
about
rabbits
.
it
's
a
tale
of
survival
team-work
friendship
and
perseverance
.
i
think
that
this
message
is
a
valid
one
for
adults
and
children
alike
and
that
at
some
point
everyone
should
read
this
book
.
i
ca
n't
believe
that
i
did
n't
read
it
in
my
childhood

heroes
especially
in
chapter
41
of
my
edition
titled
the
story
of
rowsby
woof
and
the
fairy
wogdog
.
all
the
legends
in
this
book
celebrate
rabbit
character
and
remind
our
assorted
bunnies
that
they
too
can
live
as
their
heroes
did
.
all
they
have
to
do
is
believe
in
themselves

in
each
other

referred
to
a
list
at

the
author
alternately
refers
to
rabbits
by
their
birth
name
which
is
in
rabbit
speak
lapine
and
also
by
their
nickname
.
for
example
little
pipkin
is
also
referred
to
by
his
lapine
name
hlao-roo
.
also
a
glossary
of
lapine
words
is
listed
at
the
foot
of
this
review
inside
a
spoiler
tag
.
the
definitions
are
from
the
back
of
the
e-book
.
plus
try
the
quiz
created
by
emily
holmes.key
words
one
lapine
word
that
appears
to
absurd
excess
is
``
hraka
''
for
``
rabbit
droppings
''
--
these
bucks
ca
n't
make
a
move
without
first
stopping
to
pass
hraka
analyze
that
.
another
frequent
word
is
``
silflay
''
which
means
``
graze
on

''
--
coming
up
out
of
the
burrow
at
dawn
and
dusk
the
times
when
all
wild
rabbits
indeed
do
graze
or
silflay
.
when
rabbits
go
``
tharn
''
they
freeze
paralyzed
with
fear
.
also
the
lapine
word
for
``
catastrophic
death
or
destruction
''
is
``
zorn
''
--
shouted
several
times
in
the
story
especially
after
attack
by
``
elil
''
enemies
of
all
kinds.plot
summary
the
story
is
set
in
berkshire
england
in
a
real
place
in
the
countryside
called
watership
down
.
it
begins
at
the
sandleford
warren
where
fiver
a
prophetic
and
undersized
young
buck
warns
of
catastrophic
destruction
.
fiver
's
capable
older
brother
hazel
heeds
the
warning
and
leads
11
bucks
away
.
several
miles
later
frightened
and
exhausted
they
join
cowslip
's
wonderful
warren
â
until
they
learn
the
horrible
truth
.
they
take
to
the
fields
again
and
finally
their
long
dangerous
journey
â
similar
to
the
odyssey
â
ends
at
watership
down
.
these
lonely
high
hills
offer
the
perfect
place
to
dig
a
new
warren
.
now
only
one
problem
remains
they
have
no
does
.
no
does
no
babies
no
future
.
so
off
they
go
to
find
some
does
discovering
a
great
evil
in
the
meadow
where
woundwort
rules
in
a
terror
comparative
to
a
wrinkle
in
time

with

hazel

bucks
fight
to
free
some
desperate
does
from
woundwort
's
warren
efrafa
confronting
fearsome
beasties

the
story
includes

of

prince
with
a
thousand
enemies
the
first

these

draw
strength
comfort

inspiration
from

the
beloved

daring

clever
outwitting

my
response
i
was
fairly
captivated
.
the
writing
is
beautiful
and
the
story
gripping
except
for
some
minor
pacing
problems
.
i
enjoyed
the
analogies
and
loved
watching
the
rabbits
form
a
tight
bond
and
grow
in
character
.
because
rabbits
are
by
nature
fearful
prey
animals
i
could
almost
taste
their
desperation
as
they
traveled
across
open
country
in
search
of
a
safe
warren
.
i
could
almost
hear
their
hind
feet
thumping
warning
of
danger
from
earth
and
sky
.
when
they
finally
get
a
chance
to
kick
back
and
relax
i
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
too
.
ã
i
grew
to
love
these
rabbits
.
rabbits
run
free
on
our
land
.
i
'm
no
expert
but
they
do
behave
much
as
depicted
here
.
i
also
enjoyed
learning
to
speak
lapine
.
adams
created
a
clever
language
.
clever
as
they
are
i
felt
that
all
the
legends
about
el-ahrairah
interrupted
the
plot
.
there
are
at
least
five
legends
each
one
an
entire
chapter
.
however
the
legends
are
used
to
inspire
the
rabbits
to
solve
problems
and
they
are
quite
good.but
imo
the
best
aspect
of
this
book
is
the
character
development
.
nicely
done
if
not
for
hazel
they
might
not
have
made
it
but
hazel
counted
on
his
whole
team
especially
his
wonderful
loving
brother
fiver
who
can
see
into
the
future
and
hear
warnings
of
danger
supposedly
straight
from
lord
frith
the
sun
their
god
.
together
hazel
and
fiver
are
unbeatable
winning
every
buck
's
trust
until
eventually
hazel
is
dubbed
hazel-rah
leader
prince
royal
.
hazel
is
not
perfect
thank
frith
for
that
--
unflawed
heroes
are
boring
but
he
learns
from
his
mistakes
.
his
greatest
strengths
are
his
willingness
to
put
himself
at
risk
for
his
friends
his
shrewd
wit
for
example
befriending
non-rabbits
and
his
easy-going
leadership
style
.
hazel
's
introduction
``
although
he
was
a
yearling
and
still
below
full
weight
he
had
not
the
harassed
look
of
most
``
outskirters
''
...
he
looked
as
though
he
knew
how
to
take
care
of
himself
.
there
was
a
shrewd
buoyant
air
about
him
as
he
sat
up
looked
around
and
rubbed
both
front
paws
over
his
nose
.
as
soon
as
he
was
satisfied
that
all
was
well
he
laid
back
his
ears
and
set
to
work
on
the
grass.hazel
also
counted
on
bigwig
whose
lapine
name
is
thlayli
which
means
``
fur
head
''
see
the
mohawk-like
tuft
between
his
ears
.
this
big
buck
grew
in
character
across
the
chapters
.
at
first
too
brash
he
becomes
more
of
a
team
player
more
reflective
and
kind
and
in
the
end
utterly
loveable
and
sacrificial
.
this
early
portrayal
of
bigwig
changes
drastically
over
the
course
of
the
story
view
spoilerhazel
felt
at
a
loss
.
in
front
of
him
stood
bigwig
sodden
wet
undaunted
single-minded
â
the
very
picture
of
decision
.
at
his
shoulder
was
fiver
silent
and
twitching
.
he
saw
blackberry
watching
him
intently
waiting
for
his
lead
and
disregarding
bigwig
's
.
then
he
looked
at
pipkin
huddled
into
a
fold
of
sand
more
panic-stricken
and
helpless
than
any
rabbit
he
had
ever
seen
.
at
this
moment
up
in
the
wood
there
broke
out
an
excited
yelping
and
a
jay
began
to
scold.hazel
spoke
through
a
kind
of
light-headed
trance
.
``
well
you
'd
better
get
on
then
''
he
said
``

anyone
else
who

'm

``
hazel
could
not
help
noticing
with
reluctant
admiration
that
although
bigwig
had
lost
his
temper
he
was
apparently
in
no
hurry
on
his
own
account
and
seemed
less
frightened
than
any
of

narra
di
un
gruppo
sparuto
di
conigli
che
grazie
al
famoso
intuito
di
uno
di
essi
scappano
in
tempo
dalla
loro
conigliera
prima
che
questa
venga
sterminata
da
alcuni
uomini
che
vogliono
costruirci
sopra
.
il
viaggio
appare
lunghissimo
ma
ã
in
realtã
molto
breve
.
il
lettore
ã
subito
spinto
a
ragionare
in
termini
``
coniglieschi
''
e
anche
la
concezione
del
tempo
cambia
.
prima
di
giungere
al
colle

dove
decidono
di
costruire
la
loro
nuova
casa
questo
gruppo
di
conigli
incapperã
in
pericoli
piã¹
o
meno
grandi
.
attraverso
i
loro
occhi
vediamo
il
mondo
da
un'altra
prospettiva
una
prospettiva
che
con
la
nostra
non
ha
nulla
a
che
fare
e
grazie
a
questo
possiamo
imparare
a
capire
un
po

di
piã¹
la
natura
.
forse
anche
a
rispettarla.inquietante
ã
l'episodio
della
conigliera
``
maledetta
''
.
questo
posto
sembra
molto
accogliente
ma
i
conigli
in
realtã
sono
apatici
.
vivono
vicinissimi
agli
uomini
e
si
cibano
alla
grande
perã²
ogni
tanto
qualcuno
scompare
.
sono
troppo
abituati
a
questo
metodo
di
vita
a
questo
patto
uomo-coniglio
per
cambiare
le
cose
e
aprire
gli
occhi.dopo
questo
le
acque
sembrano
calmarsi
.
finalmente
i
conigli
hanno
trovato
la
loro
conigliera
.
vengono
raggiunti
da
due
sopravvissuti
alla
strage
della
loro
vecchia
casa
.
se
non
che
si
accorgono
di
essere
destinati
all'estinzione
nel
caso
non
provvedano
a
trovare
qualche
femmina
.
cosã
parte
la
ricerca
anche
grazie
a
un
gabbiano
che
si
fanno
amico
con
l'intelligenza
del
loro
capo
moscardo
.
gli
unici
conigli
nei
paraggi
sono
quelli
domestici
chiusi
in
gabbia
di
una
fattoria
lã
vicino
.
gli
altri
appartengono
a
una
grandissima
conigliera
a
due
tre
giorni
di
viaggio
.
mentre
una
spedizione
parte
per
questa
conigliera
moscardo
e
nicchio
un
altro
coniglio
tentano
una
sortita
alla
fattoria
per
vedere
se
possono
fare
qualcosa
con
i
conigli
domestici
.
questi
sono
quattro
e
hanno
un
po
'
paura
a
seguirli
.
moscardo
promette
di
ritornare
molto
presto
.
mi
fermo
qui
nel
raccontare
l'episodio
perchã
se
no
svelo
tutta
la
trama
.
tornando
alla
spedizione
per
la
grande
conigliera
che
dã
poi

del
romanzo
intendo
analizzare
attentamente

trattasi
di
un
tiranno
ed

la
sua
conigliera
non
ã
altro
che
una
dittatura
oligarchica
.
qui
si
inserisce
il
tema
sociale
del
romanzo
.
e
spero
di
non
essermi
sbagliato
e
di
non
star
sparando
un
mare
di
stronzate
.
questa
societã
conigliesca
ã
retta
da
vulneraria
e
da
una
specie
di
aristocrazia
militare
chiamata
ausla
presente
quasi
in
tutte
le
conigliere
ma
qui
con
poteri
praticamente
assoluti
.
gli
orari
dei
conigli
sono
scanditi
regolarmente
.
nessuno

ne

chi
tenta
la
fuga

ammazzato
o
torturato

da

ma

generale
vulneraria

cedere

in

stato
dittatoriale
in

composto
da

da
umani

suo
finale
fallimento
possiamo
vederci
decine
di
episodi
storici
e
attuali.ultimo
fatto
rilevante
del
romanzo
ã
la
bontã
umana
nei
bambini
assente
invece
negli
uomini

i
conigli
reputano
l'uomo
uno
dei
nemici
principali
eppure
sarã
una
bambina
a
compiere
un
atto
molto
buono
alla
fine
.
in
questo
romanzo

dei
conigli

mettere
benisismo

uomini

il
tema
del
viaggio
e
della
libertã
di

casa
e

di
pace
sono
elevati
a
``
ricerca
della
felicitã

e
possiamo
tutti
desiderare
di
essere
conigli
per
godere
dell'erbetta
fresca
e
di
tutti
quei
paesaggi

osservati
con
occhi
veramente
attenti
-
che
l'autore
ci
descrive
cosã
splendidamente
ricchi
di
colori
ma
anche
di
insidie
.
e
tutti
vorremmo
vivere
in
una
societã

cui
