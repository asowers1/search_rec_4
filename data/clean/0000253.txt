when
sabotaged
by

of

reveals
that
he
was

to
perform
the
difficult
act
of
``

planting

.
saito
insists
on
accompanying
the
team
to
verify
their
success
.
when
ariadne
shares
a
dream
with
cobb
he
reveals
to
her
that
his
subconscious
recreates
mal
and
she
appears
frequently
in
his
dreams
as
a
hostile
force
.
when
the
elder
fischer
dies
in
sydney
robert
fischer
accompanies
the
body
on
a
flight
back
to
los
angeles
which
the
team
uses
as
an
opportunity
to
isolate
fischer
.
cobb
sedates
him
bringing
him
into
a
shared
dream
with
the
extractors
.
at
each
level
in
the
layered
dreaming
the
person
generating
the
dream
stays
behind
to
set
up
a
``
kick
''
that
will
be
used
to
awaken
the
other
sleeping
team
members
who
have
entered
another
dream
layer
deeper
.
while
death
in
a
dream
would
under
normal
circumstances
cause
the
dreamer
to
wake
up
the
sedatives
used
to
stabilize
the
dreams
would
not
allow
that
.
thus
death
during
the
mission
will
result
in
entering
limbo
an
expanse
of
infinite
raw
subconscious
from
which
it
is
very
difficult
to
escape
.

los

the

abducts
fischer
but
it
emerges
that
fischer
has
been
trained
to
resist
extraction
.
he
reflexively
creates
a
team
of
bodyguards
who
protect
him
wounding
saito
severely
.
even
worse
a
barreling
freight
train
plows
down
the
avenue

temporarily
takes
the
appearance
of
fischer
's
godfather
peter
browning
tom

to
suggest
fischer
reconsider
his

yusuf
drives
the
team
in
a
van
as
the
rest
are
sedated
into
the
second
level
a
hotel
dreamed
by
arthur
.
on
this
level
the
extractors
recruit
fischer
convincing
him
that
his
kidnapping
was
orchestrated
by
browning
and
that
they
are
fischer
's
subconscious
protectors
.
they
persuade
him
to
go
down
another
level
to
explore
browning
's
subconscious
whereas
it
is
actually
a
ruse
to
enter
his
own
.
the
third
level
is
a
snowy
mountain
fortress
dreamed
by
eames
.
meanwhile
yusuf
under
assault
in
the
first
level
accidentally
initiates
his
kick
too
soon
by
driving
off
a
bridge
removing
the
gravity
of
arthur
's
dream
world
and
causing
an
avalanche
in

is
forced
to
improvise
a
new
kick
using
an
elevator
that
will
be
synchronized
with

the
water

team
in

and

while
eames
remains
on
his
dream
level
to
set
up
a
kick
by
rigging
the
fortress
with

.
cobb
reveals
to
ariadne
that
he
and
mal
went
to
limbo
while
experimenting
with
the
dream-sharing
technology
where
they
spent
``
fifty
years
''
of
experienced
time
constructing
a
world
from
their
shared
memories
while
seemingly
growing
old
together
.
cobb
confesses
that
in
order
to
ensure
mal
would
leave
limbo
he
had
implanted
the
idea

reality

false
in

head

was
how
he
knew

experience
destabilised

convinced

was
still

in
an
attempt

committed

nolan
also
wrote
and
directed
it

initially
nolan
wrote
an
80-page
treatment
about
dream-stealers.5
originally
nolan
had
envisioned
inception
as
a
horror
film5
but
eventually
wrote
it
as
a
heist
film
even
though
he
found
that
``
traditionally
they
are
very
deliberately
superficial
in
emotional
terms
.
``
31
upon
revisiting
his
script
he
decided
that
basing
it
in
that
genre
did
not
work
because
the
story
``
relies
so
heavily
on
the
idea
of
the
interior

the
idea
of
dream
and
memory

i
realized
i
needed
to
raise
the
emotional

``

nolan
worked
on
the
script
for
nine
to
ten
years.14
when
he
first
started
thinking
about
making
the
film
nolan
was
influenced
by
``
that
era
of
movies
where
you
had
the
matrix
1999
you
had
dark
city
1998
you
had
the
thirteenth
floor
1999
and
to
a
certain
extent
you
had
memento
2000
too
.
they
were
based
in
the
principles
that
the
world
around
you
might
not
be
real
.
``
3132
nolan
first
pitched
the
film
to
warner
bros.
in
2001
but
then
felt
that
he
needed
more
experience
making
large-scale
films
and
embarked
on
batman
begins
and
the
dark
knight.6
he
soon
realized
that
a
film
like
inception
needed
a
large
budget
because
``
as
soon
as
you
're
talking
about
dreams
the
potential
of
the
human
mind
is
infinite
.
and
so
the
scale
of
the
film
has
to
feel
infinite
.
it
has
to
feel
like
you
could
go
anywhere
by
the
end
of
the
film
.
and
it
has
to
work
on
a
massive
scale
.
``
6
after
making
the
dark
knight
nolan
decided
to
make
inception
and
spent
six
months
completing
the
script.6
nolan
states
that
the
key
to
completing
the
script
was
wondering
what
would
happen
if
several
people
shared
the
same
dream
.
``
once
you
remove
the
privacy
you
've
created
an
infinite
number
of
alternative
universes
in
which
people
can
meaningfully
interact
with
validity
with
weight
with
dramatic
consequences

met
him
several
times
but
was
unable
to
convince
him
to
appear

dicaprio
finally
agreed

how

``
34
he
read
the

found
it
to

also
chose

he
prefers
shooting
on

using
prime
lenses
which
is
not
possible
with

nolan
has
also
criticised
the
dim
image
that
3d
projection
produces
and
disputes
that
traditional
film
does
not
allow
realistic
depth
perception
saying
``
i
think
it
's
a
misnomer
to
call
it
3d
versus
2d
.
the
whole
point
of
cinematic
imagery
is
it
's
three
dimensional
...
you
know
95
of
our
depth
cues
come
from
occlusion
resolution
color
and
so
forth
so
the
idea
of
calling
a
2d
movie
a
'2d
movie
'
is
a
little
misleading
.
``
52
nolan
did
test
converting
inception
into
3d
in
post-production
but
decided
that
while
it
was
possible
he
lacked
the
time
to
complete
the
conversion
to
a
standard
he
was
happy
with.552
in

jonathan
liebesman
suggested
that
warner

were
attempting
a
3d
conversion
for

wally
pfister
gave

distinctive
look
to
aid
the
audience

recognition

narrative

heavily
crosscut

warm
hues

the
scenes
in

more
neutral.54

said
that

``
deals
with
levels
of
reality

perceptions
of

is
something
i

describing

visual
effectsedit
for

sequences
in

nolan
used
little
computer-generated
imagery
preferring
practical
effects
whenever
possible
.
nolan
said
``
it
's
always
very
important
to
me
to
do

if

enhance

``
56
to
this

then
blew
it
up
for
the
film

for
the
fight
scene
that
takes
place

used
cg-based
effects
to
``
subtly
bend

physics
space

``
57
the
most
challenging
effect
was
the
``
limbo

city
level
at
the
end
of
the
film

it
continually
developed
during

franklin
had

the

of

takes

this

creates

where

criticised

sequencing
compared
to
buãuel
who
``
silently
pushed
us
into
reveries
and
left
us
alone
to
enjoy
our
wonderment

nolan
is
working
on
so
many
levels
of
representation
at
once
that
he
has
to
lay
in
pages
of
dialogue
just
to
explain
what
's

the

captures
``
the

``
65
deirdre
barrett
a
dream
researcher
at
harvard
university
said
that
nolan
did
not
get
every
detail
accurate
regarding
dreams
but
their
illogical
rambling
disjointed
plots
would
not
make
for
a
great
thriller
anyway
.
however
``
he
did
get
many
aspects
right
''
she
said
citing
the
scene
in
which
a

shoved
into

bath
and
in

gushes
into

much

you
very
often
wake
up

after

.66
nolan
himself
said
``
i
tried
to
work
that
idea
of
manipulation
and
management
of
a
conscious
dream

a
skill
that

.
really
the
script
is
based
on
those
common
very
basic
experiences
and
concepts
and
where
can
those
take
you
and
the
only
outlandish
idea
that
the
film
presents
really
is
the
existence

technology

allows

to
enter

similar

both
the

highly
active

deals

paul
argued
that
the
experience
of
going
to
a
picturehouse
is
itself
an
exercise
in
shared
dreaming

when
viewing

the
film

cutting
between
scenes
forces
the
viewer
to
create
larger

pieces
together

this
demand
of
production
parallel
to
consumption
of
the
images
