the
eagle
has
landed
by
jack
higgins
is
a
novel
set
during
world
war
ii
.
the
book
was
published
in
1975
and
become
a
best
seller
as
well
as
a
movie
1976
starring
michael
caine
donald
sutherland
jenny
agutter
and
robert
duvall
.
at
a
meeting
of
the
german
high
command
hitler
orders
the
head
of
the
abwehr
admiral
canaris
to
make
a
feasibility
study
of
a
plan
to
capture
british
prime
minister
winston
churchill
.
fearing
himmler
rather
than
hitler
canaris
orders
oberst
radl
to
check
the
possibilities
.
to
his
surprise
radl
finds
that
a
german
spy
joanna
grey
knows
when
and
where
churchill
will
be
vacationing
on
a
certain
weekend
.
himmler
orders
radl
to
proceed
without
the
knowledge
of
canaris
.
radl
arranges
for
a
member
of
the
ira
liam
devlin
to
be
smuggled
to
norfolk
posing
as
a
wounded
veteran
and
arrange
for
the
landing
of
a
crack
german
commando
team
.
the
man
to
head
the
mission
is
disgraced
lt.
col.
kurt
steiner
and
the
men
who
backed
him
up
after
his
court
martial
.
the
team
is
dropped
into
norfolk
disguised
as
free
polish
troops
and
get
on
with
their
assignment
to
capture
the
prime
minister
.
the
eagle
has
landed
by
jack
higgins
is
a
solid
well
written
story
with
many
enjoyable
elements
and
interesting
characters
.
the
story
is
not
just
a
war
story
but
also
involves
clandestine
operations
which
reach
the
highest
levels
in
both
the
english
and
the
german
governments
.
the
characters
in
the
novel
are
developed
and
i
the
premise
was
very
interesting
although
it
took
a
while
to
get
there
.
the
first
and
third
parts
of
the
book
are
excellent
the
middle
dragged
on
a
bit
.
the
storyline
alternates
between
a
village
in
wartime
england
and
the
nazi
regime
.
it
was
interesting
to
read
how
even
the
nazi
spy
agency
abwehr
where
threatened
by
the
ss
and
no-one
not
even
high-ranking
military
officials
were
safe
from
their
brutal
tactics
.
the
story
while
simple
at
first
gets
more
and
more
complex
as
it
unravels
.
the
reader
is
privy
to
the
german
high
command
their
planning
train
of
thought
and
the
struggles
and
consequences
of
their
actions
.
the
astute
reader
will
read
between
the
lines
to
glimpse
of
the
police
apparatus
himmler
has
put
in
place
that
does
not
distinguish
between
friend
or
foe
.
the
novel
is
an
excellent
read
especially
for
fans
of
stories
set
in
world
war
ii
or
the
espionage
genre
.
while
the
pace
is
a
bit
slow
at
first
the
sudden
shift
in
tempo
is
both
drastic
and
dynamic
and
is
sure
to
grab
the
attention
of
any
lover
of
the
genre
.
buy
this
book
in
paper
or
electronic
format
