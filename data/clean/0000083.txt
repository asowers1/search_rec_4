backgroundedit
in
writing
the
novel
montgomery
was
inspired
by
notes
she
had
made
as
a
young
girl
about
a
couple
who
were
mistakenly
sent
an
orphan
girl
instead
of
the
boy
they
had
requested
yet
decided
to
keep
her
.
she
drew
upon
her
own
childhood
experiences
in
rural
prince
edward
island
.
montgomery
used
a
photograph
of
evelyn
nesbit
as
the
model
for
the
face
of
anne
shirley
which
she
had
clipped
from
new
yorkâs
metropolitan
magazine
and
put
on
the
wall
of
her
bedroom.5

was
also
inspired
by
the
``
formula
ann
''
orphan
stories
which
were
popular
at
the
time
and
distinguished
her
character
by
spelling
her
name
as
``
anne
.

based
other
characters

gilbert
blythe
in

on
people
she
knew

said

she
wrote
the
novel
in
the
twilight
of
the
day
while
sitting
at
her
window
and
overlooking
