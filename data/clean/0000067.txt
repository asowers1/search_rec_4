overviewcontextcharacter
list
the
catcher
in
the
rye
is
set
around
the
1950s
and
is
narrated
by
a
young
man
named
holden
caulfield
.
holden
is
not
specific
about
his
location
while
hes
telling
the
story
but
he
makes
it
clear
that
he
is
undergoing
treatment
in
a
mental
hospital
or
sanatorium
.
the
events
he
narrates
take
place
in
the
few
days
between
the
end
of
the
fall
school
term
and
christmas
when
holden
is
sixteen
years
old
.
holdens
story
begins
on
the
saturday
following
the
end
of
classes
at
the
pencey
prep
school
in
agerstown
pennsylvania
.
pencey
is
holdens
fourth
school
he
has
already
failed
out
of
three
others
.
at
pencey
he
has
failed
four
out
of
five
of
his
classes
and
has
received
notice
that
he
is
being
expelled
but
he
is
not
scheduled
to
return
home
to
manhattan
until
wednesday
.
he
visits
his
elderly
history
teacher
spencer
to
say
goodbye
but
when
spencer
tries
to
reprimand
him
for
his
poor
academic
performance
holden
becomes
annoyed
.
back
in
the
dormitory
holden
is
further
irritated
by
his
unhygienic
neighbor
ackley
and
by
his
own
roommate
stradlater
.
stradlater
spends
the
evening
on
a
date
with
jane
gallagher
a
girl
whom
holden
used
to
date
and
whom
he
still
admires
.
during
the
course
of
the
evening
holden
grows
increasingly
nervous
about
stradlaters
taking
jane
out
and
when
stradlater
returns
holden
questions
him
insistently
about
whether
he
tried
to
have
sex
with
her
.
stradlater
teases
holden
who
flies
into
a
rage
and
attacks
stradlater
.
stradlater
pins
holden
down
and
bloodies
his
nose
.
holden
decides
that
hes
had
enough
of
pencey
and
will
go
to
manhattan
three
days
early
stay
in
a
hotel
and
not
tell
his
parents
that
he
is
back
.
on
the
train
to
new
york
holden
meets
the
mother
of
one
of
his
fellow
pencey
students
.
though
he
thinks
this
student
is
a
complete
bastard
he
tells
the
woman
made-up
stories
about
how
shy
her
son
is
and
how
well
respected
he
is
at
school
.
when
he
arrives
at
penn
station
he
goes
into
a
phone
booth
and
considers
calling
several
people
but
for
various
reasons
he
decides
against
it
.
he
gets
in
a
cab
and
asks
the
cab
driver
where
the
ducks
in
central
park
go
when
the
lagoon
freezes
but
his
question
annoys
the
driver
.
holden
has
the
cab
driver
take
him
to
the
edmont
hotel
where
he
checks
himself
in
.
from
his
room
at
the
edmont
holden
can
see
into
the
rooms
of
some
of
the
guests
in
the
opposite
wing
.
he
observes
a
man
putting
on
silk
stockings
high
heels
a
bra
a
corset
and
an
evening
gown
.
he
also
sees
a
man
and
a
woman
in
another
room
taking
turns
spitting
mouthfuls
of
their
drinks
into
each
others
faces
and
laughing
hysterically
.
he
interprets
the
couples
behavior
as
a
form
of
sexual
play
and
is
both
upset
and
aroused
by
it
.
after
smoking
a
couple
of
cigarettes
he
calls
faith
cavendish
a
woman
he
has
never
met
but
whose
number
he
got
from
an
acquaintance
at
princeton
.
holden
thinks
he
remembers
hearing
that
she
used
to
be
a
stripper
and
he
believes
he
can
persuade
her
to
have
sex
with
him
.
he
calls
her
and
though
she
is
at
first
annoyed
to
be
called
at
such
a
late
hour
by
a
complete
stranger
she
eventually
suggests
that
they
meet
the
next
day
.
holden
doesnt
want
to
wait
that
long
and
winds
up
hanging
up
without
arranging
a
meeting
.
holden
goes
downstairs
to
the
lavender
room
and
sits
at
a
table
but
the
waiter
realizes
hes
a
minor
and
refuses
to
serve
him
.
he
flirts
with
three
women
in
their
thirties
who
seem
like
theyre
from
out
of
town
and
are
mostly
interested
in
catching
a
glimpse
of
a
celebrity
.
nevertheless
holden
dances
with
them
and
feels
that
he
is
half
in
love
with
the
blonde
one
after
seeing
how
well
she
dances
.
after
making
some
wisecracks
about
his
age
they
leave
letting
him
pay
their
entire
tab
.
as
holden
goes
out
to
the
lobby
he
starts
to
think
about
jane
gallagher
and
in
a
flashback
recounts
how
he
got
to
know
her
.
they
met
while
spending
a
summer
vacation
in
maine
played
golf
and
checkers
and
held
hands
at
the
movies
.
one
afternoon
during
a
game
of
checkers
her
stepfather
came
onto
the
porch
where
they
were
playing
and
when
he
left
jane
began
to
cry
.
holden
had
moved
to
sit
beside
her
and
kissed
her
all
over
her
face
but
she
wouldnt
let
him
kiss
her
on
the
mouth
.
that
was
the
closest
they
came
to
necking
.
holden
leaves
the
edmont
and
takes
a
cab
to
ernies
jazz
club
in
greenwich
village
.
again
he
asks
the
cab
driver
where
the
ducks
in
central
park
go
in
the
winter
and
this
cabbie
is
even
more
irritable
than
the
first
one
.
holden
sits
alone
at
a
table
in
ernies
and
observes
the
other
patrons
with
distaste
.
he
runs
into
lillian
simmons
one
of
his
older
brothers
former
girlfriends
who
invites
him
to
sit
with
her
and
her
date
.
holden
says
he
has
to
meet
someone
leaves
and
walks
back
to
the
edmont
.
maurice
the
elevator
operator
at
the
edmont
offers
to
send
a
prostitute
to
holdens
room
for
five
dollars
and
holden
agrees
.
a
young
woman
identifying
herself
as
sunny
arrives
at
his
door
.
she
pulls
off
her
dress
but
holden
starts
to
feel
peculiar
and
tries
to
make
conversation
with
her
.
he
claims
that
he
recently
underwent
a
spinal
operation
and
isnt
sufficiently
recovered
to
have
sex
with
her
but
he
offers
to
pay
her
anyway
.
she
sits
on
his
lap
and
talks
dirty
to
him
but
he
insists
on
paying
her
five
dollars
and
showing
her
the
door
.
sunny
returns
with
maurice
who
demands
another
five
dollars
from
holden
.
when
holden
refuses
to
pay
maurice
punches
him
in
the
stomach
and
leaves
him
on
the
floor
while
sunny
takes
five
dollars
from
his
wallet
.
holden
goes
to
bed
.
he
wakes
up
at
ten
oclock
on
sunday
and
calls
sally
hayes
an
attractive
girl
whom
he
has
dated
in
the
past
.
they
arrange
to
meet
for
a
matinee
showing
of
a
broadway
play
.
he
eats
breakfast
at
a
sandwich
bar
where
he
converses
with
two
nuns
about
romeo
and
juliet
.
he
gives
the
nuns
ten
dollars
.
he
tries
to
telephone
jane
gallagher
but
her
mother
answers
the
phone
and
he
hangs
up
.
he
takes
a
cab
to
central
park
to
look
for
his
younger
sister
phoebe
but
she
isnt
there
.
he
helps
one
of
phoebes
schoolmates
tighten
her
skate
and
the
girl
tells
him
that
phoebe
might
be
in
the
museum
of
natural
history
.
though
he
knows
that
phoebes
class
wouldnt
be
at
the
museum
on
a
sunday
he
goes
there
anyway
but
when
he
gets
there
he
decides
not
to
go
in
and
instead
takes
a
cab
to
the
biltmore
hotel
to
meet
sally
.
holden
and
sally
go
to
the
play
and
holden
is
annoyed
that
sally
talks
with
a
boy
she
knows
from
andover
afterward
.
at
sallys
suggestion
they
go
to
radio
city
to
ice
skate
.
they
both
skate
poorly
and
decide
to
get
a
table
instead
.
holden
tries
to
explain
to
sally
why
he
is
unhappy
at
school
and
actually
urges
her
to
run
away
with
him
to
massachusetts
or
vermont
and
live
in
a
cabin
.
when
she
refuses
he
calls
her
a
pain
in
the
ass
and
laughs
at
her
when
she
reacts
angrily
.
she
refuses
to
listen
to
his
apologies
and
leaves
.
holden
calls
jane
again
but
there
is
no
answer
.
he
calls
carl
luce
a
young
man
who
had
been
holdens
student
advisor
at
the
whooton
school
and
who
is
now
a
student
at
columbia
university
.
luce
arranges
to
meet
him
for
a
drink
after
dinner
and
holden
goes
to
a
movie
at
radio
city
to
kill
time
.
holden
and
luce
meet
at
the
wicker
bar
in
the
seton
hotel
.
at
whooton
luce
had
spoken
frankly
with
some
of
the
boys
about
sex
and
holden
tries
to
draw
him
into
a
conversation
about
it
once
more
.
luce
grows
irritated
by
holdens
juvenile
remarks
about
homosexuals
and
about
luces
chinese
girlfriend
and
he
makes
an
excuse
to
leave
early
.
holden
continues
to
drink
scotch
and
listen
to
the
pianist
and
singer
.
quite
drunk
holden
telephones
sally
hayes
and
babbles
about
their
christmas
eve
plans
.
then
he
goes
to
the
lagoon
in
central
park
where
he
used
to
watch
the
ducks
as
a
child
.
it
takes
him
a
long
time
to
find
it
and
by
the
time
he
does
he
is
freezing
cold
.
he
then
decides
to
sneak
into
his
own
apartment
building
and
wake
his
sister
phoebe
.
he
is
forced
to
admit
to
phoebe
that
he
was
kicked
out
of
school
which
makes
her
mad
at
him
.
when
he
tries
to
explain
why
he
hates
school
she
accuses
him
of
not
liking
anything
.
he
tells
her
his
fantasy
of
being
the
catcher
in
the
rye
a
person
who
catches
little
children
as
they
are
about
to
fall
off
of
a
cliff
.
phoebe
tells
him
that
he
has
misremembered
the
poem
that
he
took
the
image
from
robert
burnss
poem
says
if
a
body
meet
a
body
coming
through
the
rye
not
catch
a
body
.
holden
calls
his
former
english
teacher
mr.
antolini
who
tells
holden
he
can
come
to
his
apartment
.
mr.
antolini
asks
holden
about
his
expulsion
and
tries
to
counsel
him
about
his
future
.
holden
cant
hide
his
sleepiness
and
mr.
antolini
puts
him
to
bed
on
the
couch
.
holden
awakens
to
find
mr.
antolini
stroking
his
forehead
.
thinking
that
mr.
antolini
is
making
a
homosexual
overture
holden
hastily
excuses
himself
and
leaves
sleeping
for
a
few
hours
on
a
bench
at
grand
central
station
.
holden
goes
to
phoebes
school
and
sends
her
a
note
saying
that
he
is
leaving
home
for
good
and
that
she
should
meet
him
at
lunchtime
at
the
museum
.
when
phoebe
arrives
she
is
carrying
a
suitcase
full
of
clothes
and
she
asks
holden
to
take
her
with
him
.
he
refuses
angrily
and
she
cries
and
then
refuses
to
speak
to
him
.
knowing
she
will
follow
him
he
walks
to
the
zoo
and
then
takes
her
across
the
park
to
a
carousel
.
he
buys
her
a
ticket
and
watches
her
ride
it
.
it
starts
to
rain
heavily
but
holden
is
so
happy
watching
his
sister
ride
the
carousel
that
he
is
close
to
tears
.
holden
ends
his
narrative
here
telling
the
reader
that
he
is
not
going
to
tell
the
story
of
how
he
went
home
and
got
sick
.
he
plans
to
go
to
a
new
school
in
the
fall
and
is
cautiously
optimistic
about
his
future
.

'the
song
âcominâ
throâ
the
ryeâ
asks
if
it
is
wrong
for
two
people
to
have
a
romantic
encounter
out
in
the
fields
away
from
the
public
eye
even
if
they
donât
plan
to
have
a
commitment
to
one
another
.
'
i
thought
the
'rye
'
referred
to
in
robert
burns
'
poem
was
the
river
rye
hence
the
lines
'jenny
's
a
wet
poor
body
jenny
's
seldom
dry
'
.
in
this
regard
it
is
about
two
people
who
meet
at
a
river
with
no
crossing
which
will
cause
people
to
question
why
one
of
them
is
wet
and
what
they
have
been
doing
.
