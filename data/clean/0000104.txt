summarybriefly
this
story
tells
the
fictional
tale
of
a
german
commando
unit
that
attempts
to
kidnap
winston
churchill
during
world
war
ii
.
the
book
employs
the
âstory
within
a
storyâ
method
and
begins
with
jack
higgins
as
himself
seemingly
discovering
the
facts
behind
the
unknown
mission
after
finding
the
hidden
graves
of
13
german
paratroopers
at
an
english
graveyard
.
curious
he
begins
asking
the
local
townsfolk
and
their
reactions
make
him
suspect
that
there
is
a
great
secret
being
hidden
from
the
world
.
after
further
investigation
the
rest
of
the
story
is
higgins
recounting
what
he
has
pieced
together
through
a
combination
of
documentary
evidence
and
educated
guesswork
.
i
thought
this
was
a
very
high
quality
book
.
i
found
it
to
be
a
very
well
written
story
and
i
have
zero
complaints
about
the
strength
of
higgins
'
prose
.
in
addition
i
think
higgins
did
an
extremely
good
job
of
creating
three
dimensional
nuanced
characters
that
came
to
life
and
appear
completely
human
including
the
german
soldiers
but
more
on
that
in
a
minute
.
finally
higgins
did
an
fabulous
job
of
constructing
a
well
thought
out
highly
detailed
and
credible
plot
.
in
other
words
this
has
all
the
makings
of
an
excellent
novel
as
the
vast
number
of
excellent
reviews
of
this
book
can
easily
attest
.
so
why
didnât
steve
love
this
book
an
answer
in
4
parts
so
given
all
that
slobbering
fanboyish
praise
why
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
good
and
holy
did
i
give
this
only
2.0
stars
first
please
stop
yelling
at
me
and
i
will
tell
you
.
see
as
good
as
i
thought
the
novel
was
on
a
technical
level
i
found
the
story
itself
fairly
dry
at
the
best
of
times
and
actually
quite
boring
at
the
worst
of
times
.
now
boring
or
dry
when
dealing
with
non-fiction
or
even
classics
may
still
earn
3
stars
or
higher
if
they
impart
deeper
meaning
or
just
load
you
up
with
knowledge
.
however
fiction
is
different
.
i
read
that
to
enjoy
myself
and
so
dry
and
boring
become
tough
hurdles
to
overcome
.
here
are
my
four
main
gripes1
.
one
of
the
reasons
higgins
cites
for
the
popularity
of
the
book
in
his
introduction
is
that
it
was
the
first
time
that
regular
german
soldiers
as
distinguished
from
those
within
the
nazi
hierarchy
were
portrayed
in
fiction
as
human
beings
and
not
bloodthirsty
monsters
.
while
the
portrayal
of
german
soldiers
as
regular
people
is
certainly
laudable
i
must
disagree
that
higgins
was
a
trailblazer
in
this
area
.
long
before
this
book
was
evedwritten
the
world
had
been
introduced
to
the
following
two
loveable
scamps
and
how
do
you
not
love
klink
and
schultzie
so
sorry
mr.
higgins
but
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
hogan
and
his
band
of
heroes
beat
you
to
the
punch
as
far
the
âhumanization
of
the
german
soliderâ
is
concerned
.
thus
no
points
for
ground-breaking
cultural
revelations
.
2
.
the
fact
that
the
final
outcome
of
the
story
was
known
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
story
took
away
much
of
the
suspensemystery
for
me
.
now
this
is
not
always
the
case
when
reading
about
real
life
events
in
which
the
final
outcome
is
well
known
as
i
have
read
a
lot
of
historical
ficiton
and
real
life
crime
fiction
that
kept
me
at
the
edge
of
my
seat
.
however
in
this
case
the
slow
methodical
planning
of
the
kidnapping
just
never
seemed
to
pull
me
in
and
so
i
found
the
story
very
slow
moving
.
3
.
there
were
no
...
nada
...
zero
omg
moments
in
the
story
which
is
a
real
let
down
for
me
as
i
would
have
expected
some
in
a
taut
thriller
of
this
kind
.
for
me
omg
moments
are
those
moments
that
raise
goose
bumps
on
your
skin
e.g
.
jack
nicholson
on
the
stand
in
a
few
good
men
or
something
that
happens
that
makes
you
say
no
way
did
that
just
happen
e.g
.
for
those
that
have
seen
the
blair
witch
project
the
final
scene
made
me
almost
crap
my
pants
basically
they
are
memorable
scenes
that
stick
to
my
brain
long
after
i
have
forgotten
everything
else
about
the
book
movie
etc..
this
book
did
not
have
a
single
moment
that
will
stay
with
me
for
more
than
10
minutes
after
i
finish
this
review
.
thus
no
point
there
.
4
.
finally
while
most
of
the
characters
were
well
drawn
there
wasnât
what
i
would
call
any
real
standout
âmemorableâ
character
.
this
is
closely
tied
to
3
above
.
liam
devlin
the
ira
commando
comes
closest
and
is
certainly
a
good
character
.
however
when
i
finished
the
book
i
wasnât
anxious
to
pick
up
the
sequel
and
find
out
what
liam
would
do
next
.
he
just
did
n't
stir
the
curious
in
me
.
final
thoughtsso
i
did
n't
love
this
book
.
i
thought
it
was
okay
.
sometimes
when
i
dislike
a
book
that
the
majority
of
my
fellow
readers
rate
highly
i
will
either
be
thinking
to
myself
âwhat
the
hell
were
those
people
hopped
up
to
rate
this
dung
pile
so
highly
and
how
can
i
score
me
some
of
thatâ
or
i
'll
be
thinking
âokay
i
'm
the
dung
pile
and
must
have
missed
something
or
banged
my
head
to
hard
as
a
child
because
i
seem
to
be
clearly
mistaken
on
this
one.â
well
in
this
case
i
donât
think
it
's
either
though
my
status
as
a
dung
pile
is
certainly
open
to
daily
re-interpretation
.
i
completely
understand
how
someone
can
love
this
book
and
at
the
same
time
am
very
comfortable
with
my
âit
was
just
okayâ
assessment
.
so
for
all
of
the
above
reasons
i
just
never
found
myself
pulled
into
this
one
.
there
were
some
parts
i
liked
and
it
certainly
had
some
moments
but
there
were
not
enough
of
the
goodies
for
me
to
be
able
to
say
i
liked
it.2.0

.
in
fact
the
research
is
as
important
to
the
plot
as
is
the
book
.
the
only
issue
being
central
character
of
the
plot
was
a
heavy
weight
i
do
n't
mean
just
someone
i
mean
the
big
dog
of
wwii
so
it
may
be
plausible
that
details
of
this
operation
never
showed
up
cause
the
ramifications
if
they
did
were
dastardly
for
many
forces
around
the
world
.
i
would
leave
that
to
you
to
judge
i
for
one
feel
that
it
did
happen2
.
a
german
war
hero
yes
i
am
not
going
to
talk
about
him
because
words
wo
n't
do
justice
to
the
courage
character
or
clarity
of
thought
kurt
steiner
possessed
.
i
am
glad
that
finally
we
saw
one
yes
only
one
war
hero
from
germany
but
what
a
hero
.
he
made
up
for
all
the
years
i
read
found
all
germans
to
be
on
the
board
of
directors
of
satan
's
inc.
again
i
believe
that
kurt
steiner
did
lead
that
outrageous
mission.3
.
character
portraits
the
writer
did
research
thoroughly
for
almost
all
characters
can
be
found
by
a
simple
google
search
read
about
.
worthy
to
remember
that
this
material
would
n't
show
up
because
of
what
it
meant
so
details
are
grainy
but
there
.
what
is
also
stupendous
is
that
each
character
i
mean
each
everyone
of
them
was
essential
to
the
plot
.
what
i
enjoyed
most
was
the
brotherhood
amongst
these
warriors
.
each
everyone
a
just
soldier
unlike
what
we
know
germans
to
be
.
i
felt
sad
every
time
as
the
narrative
would
reach
the
already
foregone
conclusion
that
all
of
them
were
to
be
kia
before
the
book
reached
its
last
pages.4
.
confused
ira
professional
my
second
favorite
character
god
blessed
him
with
a
great
sense
of
humor
.
in
fact
all
irish
men
seem
to
have
it
...
he
seemed
to
have
the
most
of
it
.
in
the
whole
book
devlin
only
once
was
genuinely
sad
otherwise
it
seemed
to
me
that
god
gave
him
a
little
more
of
the
``
happy
hormones
''
none
of
the
sad
ones
.
he
shows
what
the
war
did
in
terms
of
choices
cause
i
have
come
to
believe
that
``
one
man
's
soldier
is
another
man
's
terrorist
''
is
indeed
true
.
again
devlin
lived
till
much
later
met
with
the
writer.5
.
conclusion
i
do
n't
think
i
will
ever
read
another
book
from
higgins
as
i
am
afraid
he
will
let
me
down
.
i
also
think
that
they
should
remake
the
movie
the
earlier
one
was
made
in
the
80s
but
this
generation
must
be
given
a
chance
to
see
germans
in
a
different
light
.
i
am
not
saying
i
have
turned
for
i
hated
reading
about
what
all
they
did
himmler
was
satan
on
earth
as
he
went
about
his
wretched
ways
even
in
this
book
.
but
there
were
indeed
``
a
few
good
men
''
who
were
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
barbed
wire
.

i
read
it
when
i
was
in

enough
ago
that
iâd

if

it

have

and
fewer

on

still
itâs
an

not

cleaner

i
read
it
when

junior
highâlong
enough
ago
that
iâd

if
it

it
would
probably
have
a

fewer

still

me
like
them
and

well

and

the

are

on

about

a
whole

of
action
in

and
interesting

i

even

itâs
obviously
something
that
will
fail
in
the

the
mark
of
a
good

like
this
is
how
the
tale
is
told
right
there
was
a
point
that
the
lead-up

the
operation
was
getting
a

wearisome
however
once
the
operation
started
my
interest
picked
up
quite
a
bit
.
while
the
ending
was
anti-climatic
the
last
3rd
of
the
book
was
great
.
it
was
just
getting
there
that
started
to
wear
on
me
.
so
3
stars
for
a
solid
last
third
of
the
book
and
an
ok
two
thirds
.
i
think
iâll
hunt
down

the
build-up
to
the
preparation
and
fulfillment
of
the
mission
is
gripping
the
suicide
mission
of
the
german
soldiers
in
the
channel
was
my
favourite
part
.
it
also
contributes
to
the
characterisation
of
the
different
men
and
women
involved
.
another
favourite
point
is
the
events
at
the
mill
which
i
did
n't
expect
at
such
moments
a
writer
proves
to
be
imaginative
and
inventive
.
likewise
i
enjoyed
the
churchill
twist
with
so
much
build-up
i
was
starting
to
believe
that
churchill
was
never
to
turn
up
at
all.there
were
feelings
of
brotherhood
and
mutual
respect
between
the
different
soldiers
even
across
the
enemy
lines
with
great
admiration
for
the
protagonist
.
as
a
female
reader
i
felt
my
heart
throbbing
with
so
much
honour
bravery
and
manliness
still
the
aftermath
came
across
as
very
realistic
nazi
germany
was
never
going
to
welcome
a
story
of
defeat
a
story
of
an
ill-advised
mission
that
was
doomed
to
fail
particularly
when
it
had
been
conducted
in
secrecy
.
as
it
happens
the
movie
was
being
shown
on
tv
shortly
after
i
finished
the
novel
so
i
managed
to
experience
the
whole
package
a
very
entertaining
experience
well
suited
to
the
summer
holiday
.

an
area
that
was
not

heavy
surveillance
at
this
point
in
the
war
because
no

was

.
hitler
's
days
are
numbered
at
this
point
in
the
war
but
it
is
considered
treason
to
acknowledge
this
.
this
is
not
flashy
writing
it
does
contain
a
lot
of
detail
about
paratroopers
planes
and
military
equipment
as
well
as
descriptions
of
invading
and
defending
a
small
village
with
its
irregular
terrain
as
well
as
its
crew
of
quirky
uncontrollable
gossipy
villagers
.
but
the
book
is
clearly
written
and
you
wo
n't
forget
these
people
their
personalities
their
relationships
.
the
english
are
forced
to
acknowledge
the
humanity
of
the
germans
despite
wartime
propaganda
painting
them
as
devils
.
but
even
more
unusual
higgins
leads
us
to
anguish
with
the
german
officers
and
soldiers
who
are
caught
in
the
middle
who
are
revolted
by
nazi
extermination
of
the
jews
and
by
the
idea
of
kidnapping
churchill
--
but
who
go
along
with
this
crazy
himmler
plan
knowing
that
if
they
do
not
comply
their
families
will
be
punished
.
of
course
we
want
the
german
plan
to
fail
...
but
we
come
to
know
these
courageous
resourceful
men
so
well
that
we
also
want
them
to
somehow
survive
.
there
are
no
stereotypes

be
made.this
is
the
premise
of
what
is
probably
author
jack
higginsâ
best
known
thriller
the
eagle
has
landed
.
the
plot
of
this
1975
best-selling
novel
is
probably
well-known
if
not
because
youâve
read
it
then
because
youâve
seen
the
1976
movie
with
michael
caine
and
donald
sutherland
.
a
group
of
german
paratroopers
drop

english
country

of

constable
disguised
as
polish
soldiers
in
order
to
capture
or
kill
churchill
while
he
relaxes
at

country
estate

the
plot
goes

trying

rescue
a
small
girl
who
has
fallen
into
a
stream

pulled
from
the
water
the
local
villagers
discover
the
soldier
is
wearing
his
german
army
uniform
under
his
polish
uniform.but
that
movie
was
a
severely
abridged
version
of
higginsâ
story
of
wartime
loyalties
and
betrayals
.
in
the
novel
higgins
takes
time
to
fully
develop
his
characters
.
there
are
few
ranting
nazis
in
this
book
.
the
german
paratroopers
are
simply
good
brave
soldiers
performing
their
duty
and
ferociously
loyal
to
their
commander
lieutenant
colonel
kurt
steiner
a
weary
combat
veteran
who
despises
the
nazis
.
in
fact
the
only
nazi
zealot
among
them
is
a
treasonous
englishman
a
member
of
the
ss
british
free
corps
â
a
pro-nazi
cadre
of
turncoats
â
whom
the
ss
forced
the
paratroopers
to
bring
with
them.higgins
is
best
in
his
development
of
liam
devlin
the
irish
republican
army
member
with
a
poetâs
heart
who
assists
steiner
and
his
men
.
despite
his
life
of
violence
liam
finds
himself
falling
in
love
with
a
much
younger
innocent
english
girl
a
situation
which
exposes
the
killerâs
humanity
and
vulnerabilities
.
you
canât
help
but
root
for
liam
at
the
end
of
the
book.and
when
he
reaches
that
end
higgins
asks
the
question
that
must
be
asked
after
every
battle
and
after
every
war
was
it
all
worth
it
you

the

the
norfolk
coast
where
higgins
the
author
is
futilely
seeking
the
grave
marker
of
an
18th-century
american
sailor
as
part
of
his
research
for
a
freelance
article
he
's
writing
for
a
nautical
magazine
.
in
the
course
of
this
he
stumbles
across
a
hidden
gravestone
from
1943
engraved
with
the
names
and
ranks
of
a
platoon
of
german
paratroopers
.
when
the
local
churchman
attempts
to
run
him
off
the
property
he
is
determined
to
dig
deeper
and
so
unwraps
the
secret
tale
of
german
paratroopers
sent
to
abduct
winston
churchill.apparently
higgins
felt
there
were
a
lack
of
english-language
books
that
portrayed
german
soldiers
in
world
war
ii
as
anything
other
than
foaming-at-the-mouth
nazis
and
wished
to
present
a
more
balanced
depiction
in
keeping
with
his
own
experience
.
the
idea
was
to
present
a
thrilling
scheme
organized
and
conducted
by
largely
sympathetic
professional
german
soldiers
with
the
help
of
somewhat
less
sympathetic
but
nonetheless
engaging
traitorous
helpmates
.
indeed
the
backgrounds
of
these
two
traitors
--
one
is
an
ira
hit
man
the
other
a
boer
widow
--
is
none
too
subtly
calibrated
to
highlight
the
injustice
and
cruelty
of
british
imperial
rule
.
although
the
ira
man
probably
has
the
most
time
on
the
page
and
indeed
returns
in
five
more
books
by
higgins
there
's
no
protagonist
as
such
and
the
cast
includes
a
bevy
of
german
intelligence
officers
a
village
full
of
typical
stolid
citizens
and
a
unit
of
american
troops
commanded
by
a
kind
of
loose
cannon
presumably
meant
to
illustrate
the
ill
discipline
of
the
american
cousins
not
to
mention
the
german
commando
unit
itself
.
everyone
is
kind
of
a
stock
character
without
very
much
depth
but
that
's
pretty
much
ok
for
a
thriller
like
this.the
book
's
opening
graveyard
scene
appears
to
be
a
direct
nod
to
the
1943
film
when
the
day
went
well
itself
based
on
a
graham
greene
short
called
``
the
lieutenant
died
last
''
which
also
opens
in
a
small
english
village
graveyard
with
a
memorial
to
a
platoon
of
german
paratroopers
.
that
story
and
film
which
posit
a
small
force
bent
on
sabotage
must
have
clearly
inspired
higgins
who
then
raised
the
stakes
to
the
highest
possible
level
in
his
version
.
on
the
whole
the
book
is
a
pretty
fun
read
and
very
well
paced
with
the
action
moving
back
and
forth
between
the
various
players
involved
including
himmler
.
it
does
get
a
little
heavy-handed
at
times
especially
the
scene
in
which
the
true
identity
of
the
germans
is
revealed
but
it
's
all
pretty
ingenious
and
well-executed
fun
chock
full
of
interesting
little
details
such
as
the
british
freikorps
and
things
like
that
.
well
worth
reading
by
aficionados
of

and
we
know
this
will
happen
removing
some
of
the
suspense
from
the
story.however
the
book
contains
some
interesting
ideas
.
it
presents
us
with
a
sympathetic
and
likeable
german
hero
steiner
who
is
certainly
preferable
to
his
american
counterpart
who
gets
his
soldiers
needlessly
shot
up
by
the
germans
.
indeed
the
german
plot
falls
apart
when
a
soldier
is
killed
saving
a
child
's
life.as
this
plot
device
indicates
higgins
often
sticks
to
slightly
clunky
devices
to
further
his
plot
.
the
characterisation
is
mostly
rudimentary
and
characters
are
defined
by
two
or
three
unchanging
characteristics
.
hence
.
a
good
character
will
never
be
truly
corrupted
and
a
bad
character
can
never
show
any
redeeming
side
.
the
prose
is
also
rather
stodgy.rather
damningly
higgins
returned
to
the
subject
in
a
sequel
the
eagle
has
flown
.
whilst
the
sequel
undoes
one
of
the
sadder
aspects
of
the
original
book
-
the
death
of
steiner
-
it
also
followed
the
plot
of
this
book
so
closely
that
it
made
higgins
seem
like
a
one-trick
pony
unable
to
effectively
reimagine
different
plots.overall
the
book
is
dated
but
readable
.
certainly
not
a
classic

prior
paul
koenig
commander
of
the
german
e-boat
killed
in
action
three
days
after
d-day
making
a
torpedo
run
on
british
transports
using
mulberry
harbour
when
his
e-boat
was
blown
out
of
the
water
by
the
guns
of
an
american
destroyer
.
john
amery
founding
father
of
the
the
legion
of
st.
george
was
sentenced
to
death
for
high
treason
by
mr
justice
humphreys
in
no
.1
court
at
the
old
bailey
in
november
1945
and
harvey
preston
's
comrades
of
the
british
free
corps
fared
no
better
.
in
spite
of
intensive
recruiting
the
ss
never
succeeded
in
raising
it
beyond
a
strength
of
two
platoons
.
those
who
survived
the
war
received
sentences
varying
from
life
down
to
a
year
or
two
.
an
interesting
photo
still
exists
showing
twenty
men
and
a
sergeant
serving
with
the
ss
panzer
grenadier
division
nordland
.
when
this
unit
was
sent
to
berlin
to
take
part
in
the
last
terrible
battle
for
the
city
the
british
contingent
was
ordered
to
templin
on
15
april
1945
and
their
names
disappear
from
the
division
's
records
.
preston
was
perhaps
in
some
ways
luckier
than
he
knew
.
pamela
vereker
married
harry
kane
in
1945
but
died
of
leukaemia
in
1948
.
brana
lezemnikof
the
little
jewish
girl
steiner
saved
had
jumped
from
the
train
seven
miles
out
of
the
city
and
had
been
found
in
a
ditch
with
a
broken
ankle
by
members
of
a
partisan
unit
.
she
survived
the
war
and
was
last
heard
of
in
1947
on
leaving
warsaw
for
marseilles
with
a
group
of
other
jews
their
intention
being
to
take
passage
on
one
of
the
boats
attempting
to
run
the
british
blockade
into
palestine.totally
awesome
book
and
highly
recommend
it
.

patterson
grew
up
in
belfast
northern
ireland
.
as
a
child
patterson
was
a
voracious
reader
and
later
credited
his
passion
for
reading
with
fueling
his
creative
drive
to
be
an
author
.
his
upbringing
in
belfast
also
exposed
him
to
the
political
and
religious
violence
that
characterized
the
city
at
the
time
.
at
seven
years
old
patterson
was
caught
in
gunfire
while
riding
a
tram
and
later
was
in
a
belfast
movie
theater
when
it
was
bombed
.
though
he
escaped
from
both
attacks
unharmed
the
turmoil
in
northern
ireland
would
later
become
a
significant
influence
in
his
books
many
of
which
prominently
feature
the
irish
republican
army
.
after
attending
grammar
school
and
college
in
leeds
england
patterson
joined
the
british
army
and
served
two
years
in
the
household
cavalry
from
1947
to
1949
stationed
along
the
east
german
border
.
he
was
considered
an
expert
sharpshooter.following
his
military
service
patterson
earned
a
degree
in
sociology
from
the
london
school
of
economics
which
led
to
teaching
jobs
at
two
english
colleges
.
in
1959
while
teaching
at
james
graham
college
patterson
began
writing
novels
including
some
under
the
alias
james
graham
.
as
his
popularity
grew
patterson
left
teaching
to
write
full
time
.
with
the
1975
publication
of
the
international
blockbuster
the
eagle
has
landed
which
was
later
made
into
a
movie
of
the
same
name
starring
michael
caine
patterson
became
a
regular
fixture
on
bestseller
lists
.
his
books
draw
heavily
from
history
and
include
prominent
figuresâsuch
as
john
dillingerâand
often
center
around
significant
events
from
such
conflicts
as
world
