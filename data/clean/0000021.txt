although
a

the

thousands
of
years
before
the
events
of
the
novel
the
dark
lord
sauron
had
forged
the
one
ring
to
rule
the
other
rings
of
power
and
corrupt
those
who
wear
them
the
leaders
of
men
elves
and
dwarves
.
he
was
later
vanquished
in
battle
by
an
alliance
of
elves
and
men
led
by
elendil
and
gil-galad
.
isildur
a
ruler
of
men
cut
the
one
ring
from
sauron
's
finger
claiming
it
as
an
heirloom
for
his
line
and
sauron
lost
his
physical
form
.
when
isildur
was
later
ambushed
and
killed
by
orcs
the
ring
was
lost
in
the
river
anduin
at
gladden
fields
.
over
two
thousand
years
later
the
ring
was
found
by
one
of
the
river-folk
called
dãagol
.
his
friend11
smãagol
immediately
fell
under
the
ring
's
influence
and
strangled
dãagol
to
acquire
it
.
smãagol
was
banished
and
hid
under
the
misty
mountains
where
the
ring
extended
his
lifespan
and
transformed
him
over
the
course
of
hundreds
of
years
into
a
twisted
corrupted
creature
called
gollum
.
he
lost
the
ring
his
``
precious
''
and
as
recounted
in
the
hobbit
bilbo
baggins
found
it
.
meanwhile
sauron
re-assumed
physical
form
and
took
back
his
old
realm
of
mordor
.
gollum
set
out
in
search
of
the
ring
but
was
captured
by
sauron
who
learnt
from
him
that
``
baggins
''
in
the
shire
had
taken
it
.
gollum
was
set
loose
and
sauron
who
needed
the
ring
to
regain
his
full
power
sent
forth
his
powerful
servants
the
nazgãl
to
seize
it
.
the
fellowship
of
the
ring
the
story
begins
in
the
shire
where
the
hobbit
frodo
baggins
inherits
the
ring
from
bilbo
baggins
his
cousinnote
2
and
guardian
.
neither
is
aware
of
its
origin
and
nature
but
gandalf
the
grey
a
wizard
and
old
friend
of
bilbo
suspects
the
ring
's
identity
.
when
he
becomes
certain
he
strongly
advises
frodo
to
take
it
away
from
the
shire
.
frodo

by
his
gardener
and
friend

peregrin
``

.
they
nearly
encounter
the
nazgãl
while
still
in
the
shire
but
shake
off
pursuit
by
cutting
through
the
old
forest
where
they
are
aided
by
the
enigmatic
tom
bombadil
who
alone
is
unaffected
by
the
ring
's
corrupting
influence
.
after
leaving
the
forest
they
stop
in
the
town
of
bree
where
they
meet
strider
who
is
later
revealed
to
be
aragorn
isildur
's
heir
.
he
persuades
them
to
take
him
on
as
guide
and
protector
.
they
flee
from
bree
after
narrowly
escaping
another
assault
but
the
nazgãl
follow
and
attack
them
on
the
hill
of
weathertop
wounding
frodo
with
a
morgul
blade
.
aragorn
leads
the
hobbits
toward
the
elven
refuge
of
rivendell
while
frodo
gradually
succumbs
to
the
wound
.
the
ringwraiths
nearly
overtake
frodo
at
the
ford
of
bruinen
but
flood
waters
summoned
by
elrond
master
of
rivendell
rise
up
and
overwhelm
them
.
frodo
recovers
in
rivendell
under
the
care
of
elrond
.
the
council
of
elrond
reveals
much
significant
history
about
sauron
and
the
ring
as
well
as
the
news
that
sauron
has
corrupted
gandalf
's
fellow
wizard
saruman
.
the
council
decides
that
the
ring
must
be
destroyed
but
that
can
only
be
done
by
returning
it
to
the
flames
of
mount
doom
in
mordor
where
it
was
forged
.
frodo
volunteers
to
take
on

tolkien

work
the

published
in
1937.12
the
popularity
of
the
hobbit
had
led
george
allen
unwin
the
publishers
to
request
a
sequel
.
tolkien
warned
them
that
he
wrote
quite
slowly
and
responded
with
several
stories
he
had
already
developed
.

rejected

allen
unwin
thought
more
stories
about
hobbits
would
be
popular.13
so
at
the
age
of
45
tolkien
began
writing
the
story
that
would
become
the
lord
of
the
rings
.
the
story
would
not
be
finished
until
12
years
later
in
1949
and
would
not
be
fully
published
until
1955
when
tolkien
was
63
years
old
.
writing
persuaded
by
his
publishers
he
started
``
a
new
hobbit
''
in
december
1937.12
after
several
false
starts
the
story
of
the
one
ring
emerged
.
the
idea
for
the
first
chapter
``
a
long-expected
party
''
arrived
fully
formed
although
the
reasons
behind
bilbo
's
disappearance
the
significance
of
the
ring
and
the
title
the
lord
of
the
rings
did
not
arrive
until
the
spring
of
1938.12
originally
he
planned
to
write
a
story
in
which
bilbo
had
used
up
all
his
treasure
and
was
looking
for
another
adventure
to
gain
more
however
he
remembered
the
ring
and
its
powers
and
thought
that
would
be
a
better
focus
for
the
new
work.12
as
the
story
progressed
he
also
brought
in
elements
from
'the
silmarillion
'
mythology.14
writing
was
slow
because
tolkien
had
a
full-time
academic
position
and
needed
to
earn
further
money
as
a
university
examiner.15
tolkien
abandoned
the
lord
of
the
rings
during
most
of
1943
and
only
re-started
it
in
april
194412
as
a
serial
for
his
son
christopher
tolkien
who
was
sent
chapters
as
they
were
written
while
he
was
serving
in
south
africa
with
the
royal
air
force
.
tolkien
made
another
concerted
effort
in
1946
and
showed
the
manuscript
to
his
publishers
in
1947.12
the
story
was
effectively
finished
the
next
year
but
tolkien
did
not
complete
the
revision
of
earlier
parts
of
the
work
until
1949.12

the

i
may

refer
to
my
work
.
the
lord
of
the

in
evidence
the
names
of
persons
and
places
in
this
story
were
mainly
composed
on
patterns
deliberately
modelled
on
those
of
welsh
closely
similar
but
not
identical
.
this
element
in
the
tale
has
given
perhaps
more
pleasure
to
more
readers
than
anything
else
in
it.18
the
lord
of
the

developed
as
a

tolkien

have

the

of
george

the
question
of
a
direct
influence
of
wagner
's
the
nibelung
's
ring
on
tolkien
's
work
is
debated
by
critics
.
tolkien
included
neither
any
explicit
religion
nor
cult
in
his
work
.
rather
the
themes
moral
philosophy
and
cosmology
of
the
lord
of
the
rings
reflect
his
catholic
worldview
.
in
one
of
his
letters
tolkien
states
``
the
lord
of
the
rings
is
of
course
a
fundamentally
religious
and
catholic
work
unconsciously
so
at
first
but
consciously
in
the
revision
.
that
is
why
i
have
not
put
in
or
have
cut
out
practically
all
references
to
anything
like
'religion
'
to
cults
or
practices
in
the
imaginary
world
.
for
the
religious
element
is
absorbed
into
the
story
and
the
symbolism
.
``
19
some
locations
and
characters
were
inspired
by
tolkien
's
childhood
in
birmingham
where
he
first
lived
near
sarehole
mill
and
later
near
edgbaston
reservoir.31
there
are
also
hints
of
the
black
country
which
is
within
easy
reach
of
north
west
edgbaston
.
this
shows
in
such
names
as
``
underhill
''
and
the
description
of
saruman
's
industrialisation
of
isengard
and
the
shire
.
it
has
also
been
suggested
that
the
shire
and
its
surroundings
were
based
on
the
countryside
around
stonyhurst
college
in
lancashire
where
tolkien
frequently
stayed
during
the
1940s.32
the
work
was
influenced
by
the
effects
of
his
military
service
during
world
war
i
to
the
point
that
frodo
has
been
``
diagnosed
''
as
suffering
from
posttraumatic
stress
disorder
or
``
shell-shock
''
which
was
first
diagnosed
at
the
battle

served.33
publication
history
a
dispute
with
his
publisher
george
allen
unwin
led
to
the
book
being
offered
to
collins
in
1950
.
tolkien
intended
the
silmarillion
itself
largely
unrevised
at
this
point
to
be
published
along
with
the
lord
of
the
rings
but
au
were
unwilling
to
do
this
.
after
milton
waldman
his
contact
at
collins
expressed
the
belief
that
the
lord
of
the
rings
itself
``
urgently
wanted
cutting
''
tolkien
eventually
demanded
that
they
publish
the
book
in
1952.34
collins
did
not
and
so
tolkien
wrote
to
allen
and
unwin
saying
``
i
would
gladly
consider
the
publication
of
any
part
of
the
stuff
.
``

largely
to
post-war

shortages
as
well
as
being
a
way
to
keep
down

price
of

delays

in

slightly
later
in

the
return
of
the
king
was
especially
delayed
.
tolkien
moreover
did
not
especially
like
the
title
the
return
of
the
king
believing
it
gave
away
too
much
of
the
storyline
.
he
had
originally
suggested
the
war
of
the
ring
which
was
dismissed
by
his
publishers.35
the
books
were
published
under
a
profit-sharing
arrangement
whereby
tolkien
would
not
receive
an
advance
or
royalties
until
the
books
had
broken
even
after
which
he
would
take
a
large

a
few
critics
have
found
what
they
consider
to
be
racial
elements
in
the
story
generally
based
upon
their
views
of
how
tolkien
's
imagery
depicts
good
and
evil
characters
'
race
e.g
.
elf
dwarf
hobbit
southron
nãºmenã³rean
orc
and
that
the
character
's
race
is
seen
as
determining
their
behaviour.626364
counter-arguments
note
that
race-focused
critiques
often
omit
relevant
textual
evidence
to
the
contrary656667
cite
imagery
from
adaptations
rather
than
the
work
itself68
ignore
the
absence
of
evidence
of
racist
attitudes
or
events
in
the
author
's
personal
life656869
and
claim
that
the
perception
of
racism
is
itself
a
marginal
view.69
critics
have
also
seen
social
class
rather
than
race
as
being
the
determinant
factor
for
the
portrayal
of
good
and
evil.65
commentators
such
as
science
fiction
author
david
brin
have
interpreted
the
work
to
hold
unquestioning
devotion
to
a
traditional
elitist
social
structure.70
in
his
essay
``
epic
pooh
''
science
fiction
and
fantasy
author
michael
moorcock
critiques
the
world-view
displayed
by
the
book
as
deeply
conservative
in
both
the
'paternalism
'
of
the
narrative
voice
and
the
power-structures
in
the
narrative.71
tom
shippey
cites
the
origin
of
this
portrayal
of
evil
as
a
reflection
of
the
prejudices
of
european
middle-classes
during
the
inter-war
years
towards
the
industrial
working
class.72
other
observers
have
cited
christian
and
catholic
themes
in
the
lord
of
the
rings.73
the
book
has
been
read
as
fitting
the
model
of
