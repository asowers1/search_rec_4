transparent
witness
of
the
occurrences
that
took
place
in
the
abbey
whose
name
it
is
only
right
and
pious
now
to
omit
toward
the
end
of
the
year
of
our
lord
1327
when
the
emperor
louis
came
down
into
italy
to
restore
the
dignity
of
the
holy
roman
empire
in
keeping
with
the
designs
of
the
almighty
and
to
the
confusion
of
the
wicked
usurper
simoniac
and
heresiarch
who
in
avignon
brought
shame
on
the
holy
name
of
the
apostle
i
refer
to
the
sinful
soul
of
jacques
of
cahors
whom
the
impious
revered
as
john
xxii
.
perhaps
to
make
more
comprehensible
the
events
in
which
i
found
myself
involved
i
should
recall
what
was
happening
in
those
last
years
of
the
century
as
i
understood
it
then
living
through
it
and
as
i
remember
it
now
complemented
by
other
stories
i
heard
afterwardâââif
my
memory
still
proves
capable
of
connecting
the
threads
of
happenings
so
many
and
confused
.
in
the
early
years
of
that
century
pope
clement
v
had
moved
the
apostolic
seat
to
avignon
leaving
rome
prey
to
the
ambitions
of
the
local
overlords
and
gradually
the
holy
city
of
christianity
had
been
transformed
into
a
circus
or
into
a
brothel
riven
by
the
struggles
among
its
leaders
though
called
a
republic
it
was
not
one
and
it
was
assailed
by
armed
bands
subjected
to
violence
and
looting
.
ecclesiastics
eluding
secular
jurisdiction
commanded
groups
of
malefactors
and
robbed
sword
in
hand
transgressing
and
organizing
evil
commerce
.
how
was
it
possible
to
prevent
the
caput
mundi
from
becoming
again
and
rightly
the
goal
of
the
man
who
wanted
to
assume
the
crown
of
the
holy
roman
empire
and
restore
the
dignity
of
that
temporal
dominion
that
had
belonged
to
the
caesars
thus
in
1314
five
german
princes
in
frankfurt
elected
louis
the
bavarian
supreme
ruler
of
the
empire
.
but
that
same
day
on
the
opposite
shore
of
the
main
the
count
palatine
of
the
rhine
and
the
archbishop
of
cologne
elected
frederick
of
austria
to
the
same
high
rank
.
two
emperors
for
a
single
throne
and
a
single
pope
for
two
a
situation
that
truly
fomented
great
disorder
.
.
.
two
years
later
in
avignon
the
new
pope
was
elected
jacques
of
cahors
an
old
man
of
seventy-two
who
took
as
i
have
said
the
name
of
john
xxii
and
heaven
grant
that
no
pontiff
take
again
a
name
now
so
distasteful
to
the
righteous
.
a
frenchman
devoted
to
the
king
of
france
the
men
of
that
corrupt
land
are
always
inclined
to
foster
the
interests
of
their
own
people
and
are
unable
to
look
upon
the
whole
world
as
their
spiritual
home
he
had
supported
philip
the
fair
against
the
knights
templars
whom
the
king
accused
i
believe
unjustly
of
the
most
shameful
crimes
so
that
he
could
seize
their
possessions
with
the
complicity
of
that
renegade
ecclesiastic
.
in
1322
louis
the
bavarian
defeated
his
rival
frederick
.
fearing
a
single
emperor
even
more
than
he
had
feared
two
john
excommunicated
the
victor
who
in
return
denounced
the
pope
as
a
heretic
.
i
must
also
recall
how
that
very
year
the
chapter
of
the
franciscans
was
convened
in
perugia
and
the
minister
general
michael
of
cesena
accepting
the
entreaties
of
the
spirituals
of
whom
i
will
have
occasion
to
speak
proclaimed
as
a
matter
of
faith
and
doctrine
the
poverty
of
christ
who
if
he
owned
something
with
his
apostles
possessed
it
only
as
usus
facti
.
a
worthy
resolution
meant
to
safeguard
the
virtue
and
purity
of
the
order
it
highly
displeased
the
pope
who
perhaps
discerned
in
it
a
principle
that
would
jeopardize
the
very
claims
that
he
as
head
of
the
church
had
made
denying
the
empire
the
right
to
elect
bishops
and
asserting
on
the
contrary
that
the
papal
throne
had
the
right
to
invest
the
emperor
.
moved
by
these
or
other
reasons
john
condemned
the
franciscan
propositions
in
1323
with
the
decretal
cum
inter
nonnullos
.
it
was
at
this
point
i
imagine
that
louis
saw
the
franciscans
now
the
popeâs
enemies
as
his
potential
allies
.
by
affirming
the
poverty
of
christ
they
were
somehow
strengthening
the
ideas
of
the
imperial
theologians
namely
marsilius
of
padua
and
john
of
jandun
.
and
finally
not
many
months
before
the
events
i
am
narrating
louis
came
to
an
agreement
with
the
defeated
frederick
descended
into
italy
and
was
crowned
in
milan
.
this
was
the
situation
when
iâââa
young
benedictine
novice
in
the
monastery
of
melkâââwas
removed
from
the
peace
of
the
cloister
by
my
father
fighting
in
louisâs
train
not
least
among
his
barons
.
he
thought
it
wise
to
take
me
with
him
so
that
i
might
know
the
wonders
of
italy
and
be
present
when
the
emperor
was
crowned
in
rome
.
but
the
siege
of
pisa
then
absorbed
him
in
military
concerns
.
left
to
myself
i
roamed
among
the
cities
of
tuscany
partly
out
of
idleness
and
partly
out
of
a
desire
to
learn
.
but
this
undisciplined
freedom
my
parents
thought
was
not
suitable
for
an
adolescent
devoted
to
a
contemplative
life
.
and
on
the
advice
of
marsilius
who
had
taken
a
liking
to
me
they
decided
to
place
me
under
the
direction
of
a
learned
franciscan
brother
william
of
baskerville
about
to
undertake
a
mission
that
would
lead
him
to
famous
cities
and
ancientabbeys
.
thus
i
became
williamâs
scribe
and
disciple
at
the
same
time
nor
did
i
ever
regret
it
because
with
him
i
was
witness
to
events
worthy
of
being
handed
down
as
i
am
now
doing
to
those
who
will
come
after
us
.
i
did
not
then
know
what
brother
william
was
seeking
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
still
do
not
know
today
and
i
presume
he
himself
did
not
know
moved
as
he
was
solely
by
the
desire
for
truth
and
by
the
suspicionâââwhich
i
could
see
he
always
harboredâââthat
the
truth
was
not
what
was
appearing
to
him
at
that
moment
.
and
perhaps
during
those
years
he
had
been
distracted
from
his
beloved
studies
by
secular
duties
.
the
mission
with
which
william
had
been
charged
remained
unknown
to
me
while
we
were
on
our
journey
or
rather
he
never
spoke
to
me
about
it
.
it
was
only
by
overhearing
bits
of
his
conversations
with
the
abbots
of
the
monasteries
where
we
stopped
along
the
way
that
i
formed
some
idea
of
the
nature
of
this
assignment
.
but
i
did
not
understand
it
fully
until
we
reached
our
destination
.
our
destination
was
to
the
north
but
our
journey
did
not
follow
a
straight
line
and
we
rested
at
various
abbeys
.
thus
it
happened
that
we
turned
westward
though
we
ought
to
have
been
going
east
almost
following
the
line
of
mountains
that
from
pisa
leads
in
the
direction
of
the
pilgrimâs
way
to
santiago
pausing
in
a
place
which
due
to
what
occurred
there
it
is
better
that
i
do
not
name
but
whose
lords
were
liege
to
the
empire
and
where
the
abbots
of
our
order
all
in
agreement
opposed
the
heretical
corrupt
pope
.
our
journey
lasted
two
weeks
amid
various
vicissitudes
and
during
that
time
i
had
the
opportunity
to
know
never
enough
i
remain
convinced
my
new
master
.

fantastic

but
sloppy
nook
transfer
of

images
this
is
an
excellent
book
but
i
feel
it
useful
to
provide
editing
feedback
in
this
early
stage
of
ebooks
.
the
maps
of
the
abbey
and
the
library
are
poorly
transferred
to
the
ebook
format
.
in
both
cases
only
the
upper
left
corner
of
each
of
these
maps
are
visible
on
the
bn
nook
.
this
does
not
seriously
detract
from
this
fantastic
novel
but
i
was
disappointed
by
the
seeming
lack
of
effort
to
format
these
images
appropriately
for
the
nook

more
from
this
reviewer
a
must
read
if
i
were
asked
which
book
had
greatly
impacted
my
intellectuality
i
would
say
it
was
``
the
name
of
the
rose
''
by
umberto
eco
.
even
though
the
book
was
very
challenging
and
complex
the
literary
elements
used
in
the
novel
made
it
a
very
well
written
book
.
it
entertained
me
for
five
complete
days
in
which
i
was
successfully
forced
to
isolate
myself
from
the
world
only
to
live
this
medieval
experience
at
its
best
.
after
reading
those
exhausting
first
100
pages
that
were
the
most
challenging
from
the
entire
book
in
which
the
abbey
was
being
described
with
excessive
detail
i
really
got
hooked
up
even
more
.
the
plot
advanced
extremely
fast
after
these
first
100
pages
and
before
i
even
knew
it
i
was
finishing
the
novel
with
tremendous
pride
.
after
reading
``
the
name
of
the
rose
''
everything
was
worth
it
all
my
time
my
effort
etc
.
invested
gave
their
respective
``
healthy
fruits
''
.
many
appropriate
elements
in
the
book
not
seen
in
any
other
book
successfully
made
me
feel
as
if
i
were
part
of
the
most
intriguing
era
the
medieval
era
.
the
latin
phrases
disseminated
throughout
the
text
the
magnificent
descriptions
of
the
abbey
the
historical
context
in
which
this
book
took
place
in
but
especially
the
ideas
expressed
in
the
book
were
the
elements
that
made
this
book
superior
from
the
others
to
such
a
level
that
a
movie
was
made
to
fulfill
the
vast
excellence
of
this
work
although
the
movie
is
not
as
good
as
the
book
.
the
author
also
used
an
opportune
book
structure
throughout
the
text
that
was
historically
used
by
the
medieval
intellectuals
the
scholars
.
when
they
wrote
books
the
medieval
scholars
used
summaries
at
the
beginning
of
each
chapter
and
this
made
me
feel
even
more
as
if
i
were
part
of
the
medieval
era
.
all
the
ideas
superstitions
beliefs
etc
exposed
in
the
book
really
made
me
think
seriously
.
it
is
extremely
interesting
how
the
author
combined
religion
and
philosophy
in
the
book
.
for
instance
the
blind
scholar
jorge
of
burgos
feverously
made
a
very
profound
point
about
religion
that
came
in
hand
with
the
philosophy
of
life
or
existentialism
.
jorge
played
a
huge
roll
in
the
novel
using
as
a
justification
for
his
actions
the
seriousness
of
life
not
laughing
at
anything
since
it
is
a
great
offense
to
god
.
this
was
the
main
point
with
many
more
were
philosophy
and
religion
of
the
medieval
era
fought
against
each
other
and
this
combination
really
left
me
pondering
a
lot
.
besides
this
the
book
carried
out
the
idea
of
history
throughout
its
plot
which
i
really
liked
.
this
historical
consistency
seen
throughout
the
novel
gave
me
a
very
high-quality
history
lesson
about
a
specific
part
of
the
medieval
era
.
this
is
a
very
well
written
book
that
should
be
read
only
when
you
feel
intellectually
and
physically
strong
enough
since
this
book
is
not
that
simple
and
requires
quite
a
lot
of
time
.
i
sincerely
recommend
and
it
's
a
must
read
book
.
waste
no
more
time
and
read
it
now

of

it

awesome
book
but
now
my
head
hurts
despite
the
fact
that
reading
an
umberto
eco
book
can
make
a
reader
feel
gravely
undereducated
the
name
of
the
rose
's
core
story
is
truly
a
masterpiece
.
a
patient
attentive
reader
will
be
rewarded
with
a
compelling
suspensful
layered
mystery
combined
with
keen
insight
into
the
disturbing
religious
zeal
of
europe
in
the
middle
ages
.
the
only
drawback
i
found
was
the
occasional
long-winded
digressions
into
things
that
did
n't
seem
to
contribute
much
if
anything
to
the
story
.

a
thriller
that
will
surprise
you
in
the
year
1327
brother
william
of
baskerville
is
assigned
an
investigation
of
a
possible
heresy
in
a
wealthy
italian
abbey
abbaye
de
la
source
somewhere
between
pompeii
and
passy
.
the
novel
is
narrated
by
a
young
benedictine
novice
and
william
's
assistant
adso
of
melk
.
the
story
occurs
in
seven
days
of
1327
and
the
chapters
are
related
to
the
daily
monastic
life
of
a
benedictine
convent
's
canonical
hours
matins
lauds
prime
terce
sext
nones
vespers
and
compline
.
the
book
is
503
pages
long
so
it
comes
to
around
72
pagesday
.
the
religious
bacground
is
ruled
by
the
protagonists
pope
john
xxii
1249
-
december
4
1334
born
jacques
du232ze
or
d'euse
who
was
pope
from
1316
to
1334
.
he
was
the
second
pope
of
the
avignon
papacy
.
1309-1377
elected
by
a
conclave
in
lyon
assembled
by
philip
v
of
france
.
like
his
predecessor
clement
v
he
centralized
power
and
income
in
the
papacy
living
a
princely
life
in
avignon
and
spending
a
lot
of
money
for
his
court
and
his
wars
.
the
pope
opposed
louis
iv
of
bavaria
as
emperor
and
louis
in
turn
invaded
italy
and
set
up
an
antipope
nicholas
v.
pope
john
xxii
had
set
a
a
constitution
concerning
the
taxae
sacrae
poenitentiariae
in
which
the
pope
exploited
the
sins
of
the
religious
in
order
to
squeeze
out
more
money
by
creating
the
indulgence
.
however
the
franciscans
had
a
vow
of
poverty
and
opposed
this
doctrine
thus
the
pope
wanted
to
declare
them
heretics
because
the
franciscan
belief
was
not
good
for
his
business
.
so
william
of
baskerville
arrives
to
the
abbaye
de
la
source
to
see
if
a
mediation
is
possible
between
the
two
factions
since
there
is
a
suspicion
that
some
of
the
members
of
the
abbey
are
against
the
indulgences
.
his
mission
is
overshadowed
by
a
series
of
bizarre
deaths
and
accusations
of
homosexuality
between
certain
monks-so
brother
william
aided
by
adso
turn
detectives
.
their
mission
now
is
to
find
the
killer
before
the
two
factions
the
italians
who
believe
in
the
vow
of
poverty
and
the
french
who
want
to
continue
the
practice
of
indulgence
arrive
for
a
meeting
to
consider
a
compromise
.
william
's
tools
are
the
logic
of
aristotle
the
theology
of
aquinas
the
empirical
insights
of
roger
bacon-all
sharpened
to
a
glistened
edge
by
wry
humor
and
a
ferocious
curiosity
.
william
collects
evidence
deciphers
secret
symbols
and
coded
manuscripts
and
digs
into
the
eerie
labyrinth
of
the
abbey
where
the
most
interesting
things
happen
at
night
.
his
foes
are
secrecy
religious
rules
and
a
secret
desire
to
guard
the
library-for
only
the
librarian
can
control
the
knowledge
that
leaves
the
convent
.
it
is
no
accident
that
the
book
starts
out
as
a
mystery
and
continues
to
deceive
the
reader
until
the
climactic
end-until
the
reader
realizes
that
this
is
a
mystery
in
which
very
little
is
discovered
and
the
good
detective
is
defeated
.
it
is
no
accident
either
that
the
book
should
have
been
edited-it
contains
long
didactic
passages
that
even
the
book
editors
requested
be
edited
out
.
the
author
's
explanation
for
boring
you
too
death
with
them
is
that
if
somebody
wanted
to
enter
the
abbey
and
live
there
for
seven
days-he
had
to
accept
the
abbey
's
slow
pace
.
therefore
there
are
several
hundred
pages
that
are
purposely
left
as
a
penance
or
an
initiation
.
unfortunately
for
us
the
readers
the
penance
is
almost
all
the
way
to
the
end-until
we
discover
that
the
historical
premise
and
the
crimes
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
book
.
but
rather
it
was

read
this
book
was
tough
for

to
get
through

i
kept
at
it
because
i
was
certain
it

and
it
did
there
were
parts
that
were
very
wordy
and
rather
dull

the
good

were
great

in

i

very
glad
i
stuck
with
it

the
historical
aspects
were
very
thought
provoking
and
it
was
a
darn

would
recommend
it
to
an
adventurous
serious
reader
but
not
for
a

the

what

's

epitomizes
everything
that

fictional

set
in
true

eco
's
mastery
of
medieval

his
depictions

the

the

the

intricately
tied
to
the

the

are

unless

highly
recommend
purchasing
the

for
the

i
strongly
recommend
this
italian
novel
written
by
umberto
eco
it
is
set
in
north
of
italy
in
the
middle
ages
and
the
main
characters
are
2
franciscan
monks
who
investigate
some
murders
which
happen
in
a
monastery
.
the
book
is
a
historical
novel
and
it
has
been
considered
an
authentic
masterpiece.what
pushed
me
to
read
the
book
is
the
fact
that
the
film
based
on
this
book
has
always
been
my
favourite
.
so
i
decided
to
read
it
and
surprisingly
enough
i
found
it
even
more
memorable
than
the
film
.
it
really
immerses
you
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
time
and
the
plot
so
full
of
suspanse
makes
the
book
unputdownable.what
struck
me
has
been
the
possibility
to
find
in
the
book
a
mixture
of
different
elements
such
as
the
romanticism
of
a
love
story
the
suspense
of
a
detective
book
and
above
all
a
deep
reflection
and
criticism
on
the
society
of
the
time
considered
by
the
writter
as
the
childhood
of
our
modern
europe.in
this
novel
you
will
flind
everything
you
could
look
for
in
a
book
.
i
can
assure
that
reading
it
will
be
an
unforgettable
experience

genius
a
hundred
miles
behind
eco
.
to
say
that
umberto
eco
is
a
literary
phenomenon
would
not
be
going
too
far
.
'the
name
of
the
rose
'
is
a
wonderfully
written
novel
that
intertwines
mystery
and
philosophy
in
the
captivating
late
middle
ages
.
it
is
a
book
that
can
be
enjoyed
by
both
the
thinker
and
the
sleuth
although
i
think
that
one
who
is
both
will
get
even
more
out
of
it
.
i
read
'angels
and
demons
'
as
well
as
'the
da
vinci
code
'
and
'the
name
of
the
rose
'
is
still
the
uncontested
heavyweight
champ
.
also
the
movie
does
little
to
reveal
signore
eco
's
literary
skill
so
stick
with
the
book
.

while

i
loved
it
if

you
will
understand

the
book
gives

makes

a

tedious
but

a
great
read
the
name
of
the
rose
is
a
masterful
blending
of
fiction
history
and
a
whole
lot
of
murders
.
it
seemed
to
run
similar
to
an
agatha
christie
novel
with
the
historical
aspects
of
the
book
shining
through
to
add
to
the
feeling
that
the
book
expresses
.
the
book
is
a
historical
fiction
and
a
murder
mystery
too
which
makes
for
a
fast
paced
plot
that
keeps
you
riveted
till
the
shocking
conclusion
.
a
must
for
anyone
who
loves
mysteries
historical
fiction
or
just
a
good
book
to
read

ruined

i

i
decided

buy

i
was
n't
disappointed
either

ca
n't
say
i
understood

that
the
intricate

development
was

lots
of
filler
when
it
comes
right
down
to
it
i
was
disappointed
with
this
book
.
there
is
a
murder
mystery
in
there
and
that
part
of
the
book
is
decent
overall
.
it
features
mysterious
circumstances
and
involves
well
developed
characters
.
it
kept
me
guessing
as
to
who
the
murderer
was
.
however
there
is
so
much
else
in
this
book
that
one
can
easily
forget
there
's
a
murder
mystery
taking
place
.
i
'd
say
the
book
is
half
and
half
half
a
murder
mystery
half
other
story
.
many
reviewers
seemed
to
really
like
that
.
however
i
found
it
distracting
.
i
wanted
a
murdery
mystery
.
what
i
found
in
this
book
was
a
murder
mystery
buried
in
another
story
.

i
would
only
recommend
this
book
for
true
bibliophiles
.
however
even
for
us
i
would
say
that
this
book
could
have
been
much
better
if
it
were
about
a
hundred
pages
lighter
.
thematically
it
