designing
lolita

designing
a
cover
for
a
controversial
novel
is
always
a
fraught
endeavor
but
few
novels
come
with
as
much
visual
baggage
as
lolita
.
nabokovs
daring
story
has
confounded
book
designers
from
the
beginning
the
cover
of
the
first
edition
published
in
1955
was
solid
green
.
in
the
decades
since
lolita
has
become
closely
associated
with
certain
images
most
indelibly
the
nymphet
in
red
heart-shaped
sunglasses
on
the
poster
for
stanley
kubricks
1962
movie
adaptation
which
many
book
versions
have
reproduced
.
but
the
sexualized
vision
of
lolita
perpetuated
by
popular
culture
has
very
little
to
do
with
the
text
of
nabokovs
novel
in
which
lolita
is
not
a
teen-aged
seductress
but
a
sexually
abused
twelve-year-old
girl
.
a
new
book
lolita
the
story
of
a
cover
girl
vladimir
nabokovs
novel
in
art
and
design
edited
by
john
bertram
and
yuri
leving
challenges
this
prevailing
misrepresentation
with
essays
by
book
designers
artists
and
nabokov
scholars
and
a
preface
by
mary
gaitskill
that
considers
the
problem
of
capturing
nabokovs
psychologically
complex
story
in
a
single
image
.
the
books
centerpiece
is
the
lolita
book
cover
project
for
which
bertram
an
architect
based
in
los
angeles
commissioned
designers
to
create
new
covers
for
the
book
.
we
spoke
with
bertram
by
e-mail
.
roughly
how
many
published
covers
for
lolita
exist
and
from
how
many
countries
the
nabokov
scholar
and
translator
dieter
e.
zimmer
has
about
a
hundred
and
eighty-five
covers
from
thirty-six
countries
in
his
online
covering
lolita
gallery
right
now
although
there
are
a
few
that
dont
properly
count
at
least
one
is
for
an
lp
and
two
are
for
books
about
the
novel
.
however
i
have
seen
other
covers
that
dont
appear
on
his
site
so
i
would
say
the
number
is
closer
to
or
may
exceed
two
hundred
.
you
write
that
nabokov
had
strong
opinions
about
how
lolita
covers
should
look
including
a
no
girls
dictum
that
he
later
revoked
.
could
you
explain
the
evolution
of
nabokovs
feelings
about
the
covers
the
nabokov
scholar
stephen
blackwell
argues
that
nabokov
was
always
intent
on
controlling
his
public
image
and
his
reputation
and
that
this
extended
to
translations
interviews
and
book
covers
.
of
lolitas
cover
design
he
originally
wrote
to
his
publisher
i
want
pure
colors
melting
clouds
accurately
drawn
details
a
sunburst
above
a
receding
road
with
the
light
reflected
in
furrows
and
ruts
after
rain
.
and
no
girls
.
he
also
said
who
would
be
capable
of
creating
a
romantic
delicately
drawn
non-freudian
and
non-juvenile
picture
for
lolita
a
dissolving
remoteness
a
soft
american
landscape
a
nostalgic
highwaythat
sort
of
thing
there
is
one
subject
which
i
am
emphatically
opposed
to
any
kind
of
representation
of
a
little
girl
.
but
nabokov
eventually
saw
in
the
lolita
controversy
that
his
novel
had
a
life
of
its
own
especially
after
he
sold
the
film
rights
which
along
with
the
success
of
the
book
afforded
him
the
chance
to
quit
teaching
move
to
switzerland
and
focus
solely
on
his
writing
and
later
when
the
book
was
absorbed
into
the
promotional
whirlwind
for
kubricks
adaptation
.
also
after
the
success
of
lolita
nabokov
was
kept
extremely
busy
with
translating
his
earlier
russian-language
novels
into
english
and
lolita
into
russian
and
with
new
writing
endeavors
and
he
had
less
time
or
inclination
to
monitor
public
treatments
of
his
book
.
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
he
ended
up
being
rather
willing
to
give
lolita
over
to
popular
culture
.
many
of
the
covers
guilty
of
misrepresenting
lolita
as
a
teen
seductress
feature
images
from
hollywood
movie
adaptations
of
the
book
kubricks
1962
version
starring
sue
lyon
and
adrian
lynes
1997
one
.
are
those
films
primarily
to
blame
for
the
sexualization
of
lolita
as
is
argued
in
several
of
the
books
essays
the
promotional
image
of
sue
lyon
in
the
heart-shaped
sunglasses
taken
by
photographer
bert
stern
is
easily
the
most
significant
culprit
in
this
regard
much
more
so
than
the
kubrick
film
itself
significantly
neither
the
sunglasses
nor
the
lollipop
ever
appears
in
the
film
or
the
later
film
by
adrian
lyne
.
once
this
image
became
associated
with
lolitaand
its
important
to
remember
that
in
the
film
lolita
is
sixteen
years
old
not
twelveit
really
didnt
matter
that
it
was
a
terribly
inaccurate
portrait
.
it
became
the
image
of
lolita
and
it
was
ubiquitous
.
there
are
other
factors
that
have
contributed
to
the
incorrect
reading
from
the
books
initial
publication
in
olympia
presss
travellers
series
essentially
a
collection
of
dirty
books
to
kubricks
startlingly
unfaithful
adaptation
.
at
the
heart
of
all
of
this
seems
to
be
the
desire
to
make
the
sexual
aspect
of
the
novel
more
palatable
.
very
few
of
the
covers
designed
for
the
lolita
cover
project
feature
a
girl
on
their
covers
they
tend
to
take
more
conceptual
or
text-centric
approaches
.
what
are
some
of
the
main
themes
of
lolita
that
the
designers
tended
to
focus
on
and
why
do
you
think
so
few
chose
to
feature
lolita
herself
although
no
restrictions
were
placed
on
the
designers
commissioned
to
provide
covers
for
the
book
most
were
at
least
aware
of
my
criticism
of
many
of
the
published
covers
and
they
seemed
to
take
it
to
heart
.
most
of
the
designers
were
also
quite
sensitive
to
the
idea
of
placing
a
sexualized
child
on
the
cover
.
also
many
of
the
designers
love
the
book
and
id
like
to
think
that
because
of
this
their
designs
were
more
carefully
considered
.
many
covers
featured
objects
that
indirectly
represented
lolita
or
her
vulnerability
socks
mary
janes
a
scrunchie
and
others
focussed
on
the
theme
of
obsession
or
what
the
design
critic
alice
twemlow
in
her
essay
calls
humberts
worldview
.
however
once
lolita
herself
is
eliminated
from
the
cover
its
natural
to
focus
on
words
themselves
which
nabokov
truly
savored
.
mary
gaitskill
writes
in
her
introductory
essay
that
no
cover
could
ever
succeed
in
fully
expressing
the
impossible
infernal
combinations
of
love
and
cruelty
contained
in
lolita
.
having
seen
the
richness
and
diversity
of
the
cover
project
results
do
you
agree
with
her
absolutely
.
although
there
are
many
covers
here
that
i
love
a
complete
picture
is
really
only
achieved
through
seeing
the
covers
in
aggregate
and
for
me
the
joy
of
this
endeavor
lies
in
never
being
forced
to
choose
a
single
cover
to
represent
the
novel
