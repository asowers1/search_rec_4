a

new

see
all
my
reviews
i
just
came
out
of
the
movie
30
minutes
ago
as
it
was
released
a
day
before
america
over
here.the
movie
is
visually
stunning
-
the
cgi
is
top
rate
and
you
wo
n't
spend
the
whole
film
groaning
about
how
fake
things
appear
on
the
screen.acting
was
brilliant
.
johnny
depp
once
again
proves
why
he
's
the
only
man
alive
who
can
play
the
role
of
cap
.
jack
sparrow
.
there
's
a
great
number
of
returning
characters
from
the
first
film
-
including
a
couple
i
was
very
happy
to
see
again.my
only
fault
was
perhaps
that
this
film
lack
a
certain
'heart
'
that
the
first
film
had
which
i
believe
came
because
the
first
film
was
something
very
different
which
of
course
this
film
could
n't
contend
with.that
aside
you
will
hardly
notice
it
.
there
's
a
good
plot
wonderful
sets
great
acting
and
plenty
of
laughs
.
one
of
the
best
films
i
've
seen
all
year
thus
far
