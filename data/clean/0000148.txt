behind
the
scenes
joss
whedon
talked
about
the
power
levels
of
the
various
avengers
``
i
had
to
find
a
way
to
service
all
the
characters
to
figure
out
why
they
're
in
the
room
in
the
first
place
.
my
biggest
concern
was
that
if
i
did
n't
pay
enough
attention
to
minutiae
then
the
film
would
become
generic
in
its
concepts
and
visuals
.
or
that
i
'd
be
so
concentrated
on
those
things
i
'd
look
around
and
the
film
would
n't
be
about
anything
.
''
on
the
action
scenes
and
what
whedon
terms
``
the
hierarchy
of
power
''
.
``
if
this
guy
hits
someone
he
falls
down
.
if
this
guy
hits
someone
he
flies
backwards
.
its
very
complicated
.
''
whedon
commented
on
mark
ruffalo
's
'hulk
'
actions
``
it
's
fun
to
say
that
mark
ruffalo
and
i
fought
a
great
deal
because
he
's
the
sweetest
man
that
i
may
ever
have
met
.
yes
we
did
actually
lay
out
some
mats
and
tussle
but
just
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
hulk
would
be
doing
what
a
person
does
in
a
real
fight
.
once
he
gets
angry
you
have
to
keep
asking
``
well
what
's
making
him
angry
now
...
''
and
go
moment-to-moment
.
that
's
been
the
hardest
thing
in
this
movie
.
mark
is
tremendous
i
think
he
's
going
to
blow
people
away
-
again
-
and
we
've
gone
where
nobody
has

we
have
hulk
in
the
house

everything
pisses

trivia
the
roster
of
the
team
is
similar
to
that
of
the
ultimates
roster
in
the
comic
book
miniseries
the
ultimates
.
the
ultimates
were
conceived
as
the
ultimate
marvel
universe
's
equivalent
of
the
mainstream
avengers
.
the
avengers
of

cinematic
universe

a

team
to
