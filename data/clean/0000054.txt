an

a

from
which
hundreds
of
stone
blocks
protrude
jutting
down
to
form
a

each
block
is
carved
with
a
symbol
seemingly
at

creating
a
cipher
of
unfathomable
proportion

modern

have
never
been

to
break
this

and
a
generous
reward
is
offered
to
anyone
who
can
decipher
the

ultrasounds
have
revealed
the
startling
presence

da

slap
on
the
wrist
da
vinciâs
original
commission
for
his
famous
madonna
of
the
rocks
came
from
an
organization
knock
as
the
confraternity
of
the
immaculate
conception
which
needed
a
painting
for
the
centerpiece
of
an
altar
triptych
in
their
church
of
san
francesco
grand
in
milan
.
the
nuns
gave
a
leonardo
specific
dimensions
and
a
desired
theme
â
the
virgin
mary
baby
john
the
baptist
uriel
and
baby
jesus
sheltering
in
a
cave
.
although
da
vinci
did
as
they
requested
when
he
delivered
the
work
the
group
reacted
with
horror
.
the
painting
contained
several
disturbing
âun-christianâ
anomalies
that
seemed
to
convey
a
hidden
message
and
alternative
meaning
.
da
vinci
eventually
mollified
the
confraternity
by
painting
a
second
version
of
madonna
of
the
rocks
which
now
hangs
in
londonâs
national
gallery
under
the
name
virgin
of
