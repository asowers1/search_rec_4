i
was
born
in
1910
in
paris
.
my
father
was
a
gentle
easy-going
person
a
salad
of
racial
genes
a
swiss
citizen
of
mixed
french
and
austrian
descent
with
a
dash
of
the
danube
in
his
veins
.
i
am
going
to
pass
around
in
a
minute
some
lovely
glossy-blue
picture-postcards
.
he
owned
a
luxurious
hotel
on
the
riviera
.
his
father
and
two
grandfathers
had
sold
wine
jewels
and
silk
respectively
.
at
thirty
he
married
an
english
girl
daughter
of
jerome
dunn
the
alpinist
and
granddaughter
of
two
dorset
parsons
experts
in
obscure
subjects
--
paleopedology
and
aeolian
harps
respectively
.
my
very
photogenic
mother
died
in
a
freak
accident
picnic
lightning
when
i
was
three
and
save
for
a
pocket
of
warmth
in
the
darkest
past
nothing
of
her
subsists
within
the
hollows
and
dells
of
memory
over
which
if
you
can
still
stand
my
style
i
am
writing
under
observation
the
sun
of
my
infancy
had
set
surely
you
all
know
those
redolent
remnants
of
day
suspended
with
the
midges
about
some
hedge
in
bloom
or
suddenly
entered
and
traversed
by
the
rambler
at
the
bottom
of
a
hill
in
the
summer
dusk
a
furry
warmth
golden
midges
.
my
mother
's
elder
sister
sybil
whom
a
cousin
of
my
father
's
had
married
and
then
neglected
served
in
my
immediate
family
as
a
kind
of
unpaid
governess
and
housekeeper
.
somebody
told
me
later
that
she
had
been
in
love
with
my
father
and
that
he
had
lightheartedly
taken
advantage
of
it
one
rainy
day
and
forgotten
it
by
the
time
the
weather
cleared
.
i
was
extremely
fond
of
her
despite
the
rigidity
--
the
fatal
rigidity
--
of
some
of
her
rules
.
perhaps
she
wanted
to
make
of
me
in
the
fullness
of
time
a
better
widower
than
my
father
.
aunt
sybil
had
pink-rimmed
azure
eyes
and
a
waxen
complexion
.
she
wrote
poetry
.
she
was
poetically
superstitious
.
she
said
she
knew
she
would
die
soon
after
my
sixteenth
birthday
and
did
.
her
husband
a
great
traveler
in
perfumes
spent
most
of
his
time
in
america
where
eventually
he
founded
a
firm
and
acquired
a
bit
of
real
estate
.
i
grew
a
happy
healthy
child
in
a
bright
world
of
illustrated
books
clean
sand
orange
trees
friendly
dogs
sea
vistas
and
smiling
faces
.
around
me
the
splendid
hotel
mirana
revolved
as
a
kind
of
private
universe
a
whitewashed
cosmos
within
the
blue
greater
one
that
blazed
outside
.
from
the
aproned
pot-scrubber
to
the
flanneled
potentate
everybody
liked
me
everybody
petted
me
.
elderly
american
ladies
leaning
on
their
canes
listed
toward
me
like
towers
of
pisa
.
ruined
russian
princesses
who
could
not
pay
my
father
bought
me
expensive
bonbons
.
he
mon
cher
petit
papa
took
me
out
boating
and
biking
taught
me
to
swim
and
dive
and
water-ski
read
to
me
don
quixote
and
les
misérables
and
i
adored
and
respected
him
and
felt
glad
for
him
whenever
i
overheard
the
servants
discuss
his
various
lady-friends
beautiful
and
kind
beings
who
made
much
of
me
and
cooed
and
shed
precious
tears
over
my
cheerful
motherlessness
.
i
attended
an
english
day
school
a
few
miles
from
home
and
there
i
played
rackets
and
fives
and
got
excellent
marks
and
was
on
perfect
terms
with
schoolmates
and
teachers
alike
.
the
only
definite
sexual
events
that
i
can
remember
as
having
occurred
before
my
thirteenth
birthday
that
is
before
i
first
saw
my
little
annabel
were
a
solemn
decorous
and
purely
theoretical
talk
about
pubertal
surprises
in
the
rose
garden
of
the
school
with
an
american
kid
the
son
of
a
then
celebrated
motion-picture
actress
whom
he
seldom
saw
in
the
three-dimensional
world
and
some
interesting
reactions
on
the
part
of
my
organism
to
certain
photographs
pearl
and
umbra
with
infinitely
soft
partings
in
pichon
's
sumptuous
la
beauté
humaine
that
i
had
filched
from
under
a
mountain
of
marble-bound
graphics
in
the
hotel
library
.
later
in
his
delightful
debonair
manner
my
father
gave
me
all
the
information
he
thought
i
needed
about
sex
this
was
just
before
sending
me
in
the
autumn
of
1923
to
a
lycée
in
lyon
where
we
were
to
spend
three
winters
but
alas
in
the
summer
of
that
year
he
was
touring
italy
with
mme
.
de
r.
and
her
daughter
and
i
had
nobody
to
complain
to
nobody
to
consult
.
3
annabel
was
like
the
writer
of
mixed
parentage
half-english
half-dutch
in
her
case
.
i
remember
her
features
far
less
distinctly
today
than
i
did
a
few
years
ago
before
i
knew
lolita
.
there
are
two
kinds
of
visual
memory
one
when
you
skillfully
recreate
an
image
in
the
laboratory
of
your
mind
with
your
eyes
open
and
then
i
see
annabel
in
such
general
terms
as
``
honey-colored
skin
''
''
thin
arms
''
``
brown
bobbed
hair
''
``
long
lashes
''
``
big
bright
mouth
''
and
the
other
when
you
instantly
evoke
with
shut
eyes
on
the
dark
innerside
of
your
eyelids
the
objective
absolutely
optical
replica
of
a
beloved
face
a
little
ghost
in
natural
colors
and
this
is
how
i
see
lolita
.
let
me
therefore
primly
limit
myself
in
describing
annabel
to
saying
she
was
a
lovely
child
a
few
months
my
junior
.
her
parents
were
old
friends
of
my
aunt's
and
as
stuffy
as
she
.
they
had
rented
a
villa
not
far
from
hotel
mirana
.
bald
brown
mr.
leigh
and
fat
powdered
mrs.
leigh
born
vanessa
van
ness
.
how
i
loathed
them
at
first
annabel
and
i
talked
of
peripheral
affairs
.
she
kept
lifting
handfuls
of
fine
sand
and
letting
it
pour
through
her
fingers
.
our
brains
were
turned
the
way
those
of
intelligent
european
preadolescents
were
in
our
day
and
set
and
i
doubt
if
much
individual
genius
should
be
assigned
to
our
interest
in
the
plurality
of
inhabited
worlds
competitive
tennis
infinity
solipsism
and
so
on
.
the
softness
and
fragility
of
baby
animals
caused
us
the
same
intense
pain
.
she
wanted
to
be
a
nurse
in
some
famished
asiatic
country
i
wanted
to
be
a
famous
spy
.
all
at
once
we
were
madly
clumsily
shamelessly
agonizingly
in
love
with
each
other
hopelessly
i
should
add
because
that
frenzy
of
mutual
possession
might
have
been
assuaged
only
by
our
actually
imbibing
and
assimilating
every
particle
of
each
other
's
soul
and
flesh
but
there
we
were
unable
even
to
mate
as
slum
children
would
have
so
easily
found
an
opportunity
to
do
.
after
one
wild
attempt
we
made
to
meet
at
night
in
her
garden
of
which
more
later
the
only
privacy
we
were
allowed
was
to
be
out
of
earshot
but
not
out
of
sight
on
the
populous
part
of
the
plage
.
there
on
the
soft
sand
a
few
feet
away
from
our
elders
we
would
sprawl
all
morning
in
a
petrified
paroxysm
of
desire
and
take
advantage
of
every
blessed
quirk
in
space
and
time
to
touch
each
other
her
hand
half-hidden
in
the
sand
would
creep
toward
me
its
slender
brown
fingers
sleepwalking
nearer
and
nearer
then
her
opalescent
knee
would
start
on
a
long
cautious
journey
sometimes
a
chance
rampart
built
by
younger
children
granted
us
sufficient
concealment
to
graze
each
other
's
salty
lips
these
incomplete
contacts
drove
our
healthy
and
inexperienced
young
bodies
to
such
a
state
of
exasperation
that
not
even
the
cold
blue
water
under
which
we
still
clawed
at
each
other
could
bring
relief
.
among
some
treasures
i
lost
during
the
wanderings
of
my
adult
years
there
was
a
snapshot
taken
by
my
aunt
which
showed
annabel
her
parents
and
the
staid
elderly
lame
gentleman
a
dr.
cooper
who
that
same
summer
courted
my
aunt
grouped
around
a
table
in
a
sidewalk
café
.
annabel
did
not
come
out
well
caught
as
she
was
in
the
act
of
bending
over
her
chocolate
glacé
and
her
thin
bare
shoulders
and
the
parting
in
her
hair
were
about
all
that
could
be
identified
as
i
remember
that
picture
amid
the
sunny
blur
into
which
her
lost
loveliness
graded
but
i
sitting
somewhat
apart
from
the
rest
came
out
with
a
kind
of
dramatic
conspicuousness
a
moody
beetle-browed
boy
in
a
dark
sport
shirt
and
well-tailored
white
shorts
his
legs
crossed
sitting
in
profile
looking
away
.
that
photograph
was
taken
on
the
last
day
of
our
fatal
summer
and
just
a
few
minutes
before
we
made
our
second
and
final
attempt
to
thwart
fate
.
under
the
flimsiest
of
pretexts
this
was
our
very
last
chance
and
nothing
really
mattered
we
escaped
from
the
cafe
to
the
beach
and
found
a
desolate
stretch
of
sand
and
there
in
the
violet
shadow
of
some
red
rocks
forming
a
kind
of
cave
had
a
brief
session
of
avid
caresses
with
somebody
's
lost
pair
of
sun-glasses
for
only
witness
.
i
was
on
my
knees
and
on
the
point
of
possessing
my
darling
when
two
bearded
bathers
the
old
man
of
the
sea
and
his
brother
came
out
of
the
sea
with
exclamations
of
ribald
encouragement
and
four
months
later
she
died
of
typhus
in
corfu
.
4
i
leaf
again
and
again
through
these
miserable
memories
and
keep
asking
myself
was
it
then
in
the
glitter
of
that
remote
summer
that
the
rift
in
my
life
began
or
was
my
excessive
desire
for
that
child
only
the
first
evidence
of
an
inherent
singularity
when
i
try
to
analyze
my
own
cravings
motives
actions
and
so
forth
i
surrender
to
a
sort
of
retrospective
imagination
which
feeds
the
analytic
faculty
with
boundless
alternatives
and
which
causes
each
visualized
route
to
fork
and
re-fork
without
end
in
the
maddeningly
complex
prospect
of
my
past
.
i
am
convinced
however
that
in
a
certain
magic
and
fateful
way
lolita
began
with
annabel
.
i
also
know
that
the
shock
of
annabel
's
death
consolidated
the
frustration
of
that
nightmare
summer
made
of
it
a
permanent
obstacle
to
any
further
romance
throughout
the
cold
years
of
my
youth
.
the
spiritual
and
the
physical
had
been
blended
in
us
with
a
perfection
that
must
remain
incomprehensible
to
the
matter-of-fact
crude
standard-brained
youngsters
of
today
.
long
after
her
death
i
felt
her
thoughts
floating
through
mine
.
long
before
we
met
we
had
had
the
same
dreams
.
we
compared
notes
.
we
found
strange
affinities
.
the
same
june
of
the
same
year
1919
a
stray
canary
had
fluttered
into
her
house
and
mine
in
two
widely
separated
countries
.
oh
lolita
had
you
loved
me
thus
i
have
reserved
for
the
conclusion
of
my
``
annabel
''
phase
the
account
of
our
unsuccessful
first
tryst
.
one
night
she
managed
to
deceive
the
vicious
vigilance
of
her
family
.
in
a
nervous
and
slender-leaved
mimosa
grove
at
the
back
of
their
villa
we
found
a
perch
on
the
ruins
of
a
low
stone
wall
.
through
the
darkness
and
the
tender
trees
we
could
see
the
arabesques
of
lighted
windows
which
touched
up
by
the
colored
inks
of
sensitive
memory
appear
to
me
now
like
playing
cards
--
presumably
because
a
bridge
game
was
keeping
the
enemy
busy
.
she
trembled
and
twitched
as
i
kissed
the
corner
of
her
parted
lips
and
the
hot
lobe
of
her
ear
.
a
cluster
of
stars
palely
glowed
above
us
between
the
silhouettes
of
long
thin
leaves
that
vibrant
sky
seemed
as
naked
as
she
was
under
her
light
frock
.
i
saw
her
face
in
the
sky
strangely
distinct
as
if
it
emitted
a
faint
radiance
of
its
own
.
her
legs
her
lovely
live
legs
were
not
too
close
together
and
when
my
hand
located
what
it
sought
a
dreamy
and
eerie
expression
half-pleasure
half-pain
came
over
those
childish
features
.
she
sat
a
little
higher
than
i
and
whenever
in
her
solitary
ecstasy
she
was
led
to
kiss
me
her
head
would
bend
with
a
sleepy
soft
drooping
movement
that
was
almost
woeful
and
her
bare
knees
caught
and
compressed
my
wrist
and
slackened
again
and
her
quivering
mouth
distorted
by
the
acridity
of
some
mysterious
potion
with
a
sibilant
intake
of
breath
came
near
to
my
face
.
she
would
try
to
relieve
the
pain
of
love
by
first
roughly
rubbing
her
dry
lips
against
mine
then
my
darling
would
draw
away
with
a
nervous
toss
of
her
hair
and
then
again
come
darkly
near
and
let
me
feed
on
her
open
mouth
while
with
a
generosity
that
was
ready
to
offer
her
everything
my
heart
my
throat
my
entrails
i
gave
her
to
hold
in
her
awkward
fist
the
scepter
of
my
passion
.
i
recall
the
scent
of
some
kind
of
toilet
powder
--
i
believe
she
stole
it
from
her
mother
's
spanish
maid
--
a
sweetish
lowly
musky
perfume
.
it
mingled
with
her
own
biscuity
odor
and
my
senses
were
suddenly
filled
to
the
brim
a
sudden
commotion
in
a
nearby
bush
prevented
them
from
overflowing
--
and
as
we
drew
away
from
each
other
and
with
aching
veins
attended
to
what
was
probably
a
prowling
cat
there
came
from
the
house
her
mother
's
voice
calling
her
with
a
rising
frantic
note
--
and
dr.
cooper
ponderously
limped
out
into
the
garden
.
but
that
mimosa
grove
--
the
haze
of
stars
the
tingle
the
flame
the
honey-dew
and
the
ache
remained
with
me
and
that
little
girl
with
her
seaside
limbs
and
ardent
tongue
haunted
me
ever
since
--
until
at
last
twenty-four
years
later
i
broke
her
spell
by
incarnating
her
in
another
