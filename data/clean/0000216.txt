the
animation
by
which
it
stands
or
falls
is
as
brilliant
as
ever
and
though
it
would
n't
really
be
right
to
call
it
totally
anti-disney
it
certainly
trumps
that
institution
for
sharpness
of
focus
notably
as
far
as
the
screenplay
is
concerned

shrek

it

the

shrek
2
½
making
a
sequel
to
shrek
was
both
a
complete
no-brainer
and
a
cause
for
great
concern
.
the
first
film
was
a
huge
hit
taking
more
than
eight
times
its
budget
at
the
box
office
and
winning
over
critics
and
audiences
alike
with
its
intelligent
storytelling
and
witty
script
.
but
with
the
continued
success
of
pixar
first
with
monsters
inc.
and
then
finding
nemo
you
would
have
been
within
your
rights
to
doubt
that
any
sequel
could
compete.fortunately
shrek
2
is
a
great
second
outing
thanks
in
part
to
the
continued
presence
of
andrew
adamson
behind
the
camera
as
a
co-writer
now
as
well
as
co-director
.
the
film
may
not
be
quite
as
edgy
as
its
predecessor
perhaps
due
to
dreamworks
head
honcho
jeffrey
katzenberg
wanting
to
play
it
safe
to
secure
further
outings
.
but
the
film
is
every
bit
as
funny
as
the
first
one
if
not
slightly
moreso
and
continues
to
develop
and
deepen
its
unique
fairytale
world.making
a
sequel
to
any
film
can
go
one
of
two
ways
depending
on
the
attitude
of
the
people
behind
it
and
the
potential
present
in
the
characters
.
on
the
one
hand
the
film
can
repeat
all
the
basic
rhythms
of
the
first
film
either
with
the
main
character
being
replaced
so
that
the
journey
appears
to
be
new
or
by
the
stakes
being
raised
so
that
it
feels
like
the
action
is
more
significant
.
occasionally
this
approach
works
wonders
-
as
on
evil
dead
2
-
but
often
it
results
in
tired
formulaic
offerings
such
as
the
many
straight-to-video
sequels
produced
by
disney.on
the
other
hand
the
film
can
attempt
to
tell
a
new
story
with
the
characters
undergoing
a
new
challenge
and
more
characteristics
of
their
universe
being
revealed
.
this
approach
is
harder
to
get
right
but
when
things
come
together
the
results
regularly
outclass
their
predecessors
.
the
empire
strikes
back
mad
max
2
the
road
warrior
and
the
rescuers
down
under
are
all
examples
of
this
approach
working
well
-
and
now
we
can
add
shrek
2
to
that
list.the
basic
principle
that
operates
in
shrek
2
is
the
same
one
that
operated
in
shrek
taking
familiar
aspects
of
the
fairy
tale
genre
and
turning
them
on
their
heads
with
plenty
of
humour
.
but
rather
than
simply
create
lord
farquaad
mark
ii
the
obstacles
facing
shrek
are
different
and
perhaps
more
nuanced
.
not
only
that
but
shrek
is
a
slightly
different
person
or
ogre
having
married
fiona
at
the
end
of
the
first
film.both
of
the
main
villains
are
as
entertainingly
subversive
as
farquaad
or
any
characters
from
the
first
film
.
the
fairy
godmother
played
brillaintly
by
jennifer
saunders
is
not
a
benevolent
aid
to
our
heroes
but
a
scheming
manipulative
power-hungry
despot
wanting
to
rule
the
kingdom
through
her
son
not
unlike
livia
in
i
claudius
.
magic
is
not
the
universal
force
for
good
that
it
is
in
disney
's
cinderella
the
fairy
godmother
is
more
like
her
mafia
namesake
granting
favours
in
return
for
power
and
influence.as
for
prince
charming
he
anything
but
lips
up
to
his
name
.
while
many
of
his
disney
counterparts
are
painted
as
occasionally
bland
ideals
of
masculinity
charming
is
vain
self-centred
effeminate
and
a
total
mummy
's
boy
.
rupert
everett
's
clipped
yet
world-weary
delivery
perfectly
conveys
the
frustration
of
the
character
whose
ego
and
sense
of
entitlement
take
a
severe
blow
over
the
running
time.as
far
as
the
story
of
shrek
2
goes
it
's
a
natural
continuation
of
the
first
film
in
terms
of
theme
and
plot
.
beneath
all
its
fairy
tale
trappings
and
pop
culture
references
shrek
is
a
film
about
inner
beauty
the
hard
work
that
goes
into
relationships
and
why
the
rules
of
a
given
world
are
n't
always
fair
.
bringing
fiona
's
parents
into
the
mix
is
a
logical
decision
adding
a
new
obstacle
or
source
of
prejudice
with
the
twist
of
wanting
acceptance
from
said
source
for
the
sake
of
those
one
loves.disney
films
often
get
accused
of
presenting
a
shallow
view
of
what
constitutes
beauty
in
the
little
mermaid
for
instance
the
female
lead
signs
away
her
most
distinctive
features
just
so
she
can
get
a
husband
.
shrek
2
does
the
opposite
using
a
radical
physical
transformation
to
show
how
little
such
a
transformation
changes
and
how
little
such
a
change
matters
.
the
filmakers
deserve
enormous
credit
for
following
through
with
this
idea
and
it
resonates
really
strongly
right
up
to
the
end.it
's
arguable
that
because
shrek
2
has
a
more
tongue-in-cheek
parodic
sensibility
it
can
get
away
with
such
a
heartwarming
message
purely
by
virtue
of
not
looking
or
sounding
like
a
disney
film
.
in
reality
it
earns
the
right
to
do
this
by
developing
the
characters
we
love
in
a
genuine
and
convincing
way
.
fiona
has
become
so
comfortable
in
her
ogre
self
that
it
makes
sense
for
her
to
scream
when
she
first
sees
her
human
face
in
the
mirror
.
likewise
shrek
may
still
be
bad-tempered
and
cantankerous
but
he
's
more
noble
in
the
causes
for
which
he
fights
and
a
little
more
cunning
in
the
fights
that
he
chooses
to
pick.what
this
means
is
that
the
increased
amount
of
reference
humour
in
shrek
2
does
n't
jar
like
it
does
in
later
dreamworks
efforts
.
there
are
some
cracking
reference
gags
here
whether
it
's
prince
charming
's
slow-motion
hair
flick
heartbreakers
the
wire
rescue
of
our
main
characters
mission
impossible
or
donkey
fearing
that
he
will
melt
when
it
rains
the
wizard
of
oz
.
and
that
's
not
to
mention
all
the
pops
at
brands
like
starbucks
baskin
robbins
and
versace
.
but
like
the
best
work
of
aardman
these
touches
or
little
sight
gags
take
a
back
seat
to
the
plot
and
the
film
still
works
whatever
age
or
however
culture-literate
you
may
be.on
top
of
everything
else
shrek
2
is
really
really
funny
.
many
of
the
best
gags
are
those
which
are
completely
unexpected
such
as
puss
in
boots
'
hairball
or
pinocchio
's
brief
stint
as
a
real
boy
.
others
are
the
product
of
really
good
editing
such
as
the
dinner
table
sequence
a
nod
to
rocky
horror
or
the
parallel
conversations
when
shrek
first
meets
fiona
's
parents
.
the
big
set-pieces
are
inventive
and
fast-paced
and
the
film
is
never
afraid
to
take
its
characters
down
a
peg
or
two
by
things
not
climaxing
quite
as
we
might
expect.the
performances
in
shrek
are
all
extremely
good
.
mike
myers
eddie
murphy
and
cameron
diaz
remain
as
convincing
and
enjoyable
as
before
with
adamson
and
his
co-directors
managing
to
focus
the
two
male
leads
.
of
the
newcomers
jennifer
saunders
is
very
impressive
and
john
cleese
is
a
very
fine
choice
for
king
harold
.
but
of
course
the
show
is
stolen
by
antonio
banderas
who
ribs
on
his
own
work
in
the
mask
of
zorro
to
make
puss
in
boots
truly
unforgetable.shrek
2
is
every
bit
as
good
as
the
original
and
may
even
be
slightly
funnier
in
terms
of
the
quantity
and
quality
of
its
jokes
.
despite
being
more
rounded
than
its
edgy
predecessor
this
is
still
a
very
intelligent
offering
populated
by
interesting
ideas
and
a
host
of
compelling
characters
.
in
hindsight
it
's
a
shame
that
the
series
could
n't
continue
to
progress
in
such
a
positive
way
after
this
instalment
but
shrek
2
remains
a
sterling
effort
both
in
this
context
and
on
its
own
terms
.
