trivia
director
andrew
stanton
originally
planned
to
reveal
the
fate
of
marlin
's
wife
gradually
through
flashbacks
seen
periodically
as
the
story
unfolded
.
after
a
few
early
in-house
screenings
he
found
that
marlin
came
off
as
too
much
of
a
worrywart
and
decided
to
reveal
the
entire
back-story
up
front
thus
making
marlin
more
appealing
by
establishing
the
reason
for
his
over-protectiveness
.

''
actually
at
150
crush
would
be
almost
twice
the
normal
lifespan
of
a
sea
turtle
which
is
about
80
years
.
contrary
to
popular
belief
not
all
kinds
of
turtles
have
lifespans
of
over
100
years
.
it
is
tortoises
which
are
land
turtles
that
are
known
for
their
very
long
lifespans
and
even
then
the
current
record
is
188
years
old
not
much
older
relatively
speaking
than
