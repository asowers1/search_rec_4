best
queen
songs
whether
they
're
charging
hard
rock
piano-based
pop
or
epic
mini-symphonies
go
a
long
way
in
explaining
why
the
group
is
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
most
diverse
eclectic
and
wide-ranging
bands
to
earn
their
way
into
the
hearts
of
music
lovers
around
the
world
.
in
honor
of
what
would
have
been
late
singer
freddie
mercury
's
65th
birthday
today
sept.

we
present
our
list
of
the
10
best
queen
songs
10
'stone
cold
crazy'
from
'sheer
heart
attack
'
1974
do
n't
let
the
impeccably
produced
eclectic
pop
records
they
're
most
famous
for
make
you
forget
the
fact
that
queen
could
rock
the
heck
out
when
they
felt
like
it
.
none
other
than
the
mighty
metallica
gave
this
song
their
seal
of
approval
years
later
by
recording
a
cover
and
playing
the
song
from
time
to
time
at
their
own
concerts
.

'tie
your
mother
down'
from
'a
day
at
the
races
'
1976
after
confirming
their
international
super-stardom
in
the
mid-'70s
with
some
of
the
more
ornate
and
poppish
songs
you
'll
find
later
on
this
list
it
seems
possible
queen
wanted
to
prove
they
could
still
bring
the
riffs
.
here
they
combine
the
assault
of
those
early
records
with
their
newfound
studio
wizardy
to
create
one
of
the
most
enduring
staples
of
the
band
's
live
concert
setlists
.

'killer
queen'
from
'sheer
heart
attack
'
1974
after
two
records
focused
largely
on
hard
and
progressive
rock
queen
broke
through
to
the
mainstream
with
this
ode
to
a
high-priced
call
girl
from
their
third
album
.
it
features
a
jaunty
piano
part
and
healthy
doses
of
the
multi-tracking
and
vocal
harmonizing
methods
that
would
go
on
to
become
big
parts
of
their
signature
sound
.
7
'somebody
to
love'
from
'a
day
at
the
races
'
1976
the
range
and
diversity
of
queen
's
music
is
nearly
unmatched
in
the
rock
world
a
fact
proved
to
astonishing
degree
by
the
wide
range
of
artists
that
performed
at
the
1992
freddie
mercury
tribute
concert
following
the
singer
's
death
.
broadway
stars
rubbed
shoulders
with
rock
legends
metalheads
and
pop
heroes
and
everybody
was
able
to
find
a
great
queen
song
that
fit
their
style
perfectly
.
whatever
you
may
think
of
george
michael
's
public
image
try
not
to
get
swept
up
in
the
moment
when
he
leads
72000
on
the
chorus
of
'somebody
to
love
.
'
watch
george
michael
perform
'somebody
to
love'

'crazy
little
thing
called
love'
from
'the
game
'
1980
freddie
mercury
reportedly
wrote
this
song
during
a
10-minute
flash
of
inspiration
using
his
self-described
limited
guitar
abilities
to
create
a
fantastic
rockabilly
number
worthy
of
elvis
presley
himself
.
he
plays
the
role
of
``
the
king
''
to
the
fullest
vocally
as
well
crooning
in
a
low
register
so
playful
you
can
practically
see
the
curled
lip
and
slicked-back
hair
.

'fat
bottomed
girls'
from
'jazz
'
1978
is
there
anything
we
could
write
about
this
song
that
would
possibly
explain
its
appeal
or
tickle
your
eyes
as
much
as
that
gorgeous
a
cappella
intoduction
--
``
arrrrrrrrre
you
gon
na
take
me
home
tonight
ohhhh
down
beside
the
red
firelight
''
thrills
your
ears
together
with
its
partner
on
wax
'bicycle
race
'
this
song
may
have
done
as
much
for
the
cycling
industry
as
anyone
this
side
of
lance
armstrong
.

'under
pressure
'
with
david
bowie
from
'hot
space
'
1982
queen
team
up
with
art-rock
hero
david
bowie
to
create
a
song
so
infectious
sturdy
and
undeniable
that
it
was
able
to
stand
up
to
and
ultimately
outlast
one
of
the
most
heinous
and
large-scale
assaults
on
musical
good
taste
that
's
ever
been
foisted
on
the
world
.
we
've
got
nothing
against
sampling
when
it
reveals
new
angles
of
the
original
music

to
public

but
as
nice
a
guy
as

'another
one
bites
the
dust'
from
'the
game
'
1980
queen
bassist
roger
deacon
steps
into
the
spotlight
recording
nearly
all
the
instruments
for
this
disco-rock
classic
after
reportedly
hanging
out
in
the
studio
with
'good
times
'
creators
chic
.
mercury
contrasts
the
menacing
low
groove
of
the
song
with
one
of
his
most
impassioned
and
fiery
vocal
performances
creating
a
masterpiece
of
tongue-in-cheek
boastful
taunting
.

'we
will
rock
you
we
are
the
champions'
from
'news
of
the
world
'
1977
obviously
either
of
these
songs
could
be
on
a
list
of
the
best
queen
songs
all
by
themselves
but
it
feels
weird
to
talk
about
one
without
the
other
.
without
these
living
breathing
audio
representations
of
motivation
and
victory
where
would
the
sports
world
be
here
's
a
question
we
'd
like
answered
what
did
baseball
basketball
hockey
and
football
players
listen
to
when
they
won
the
world
title
before
1977
1
'bohemian
rhapsody'
from
'a
night
at
the
opera
'
1975
was
there
really
a
question
what
would
top
the
best
queen
songs
list
this
multi-part
epic
painstakingly
created
with
razor
blades
on
state
of
the
art
machinery
that
could
still
barely
match
the
sounds
in
freddie
mercury
's
head
has
gone
on
to
become
universally
accepted
as
their
masterwork
.
each
facet
of
the
band
's
wide
range
of
talent
and
ambition
is
revealed
in
one
of
'rhapsody
''
s
six
completely
different
sections
.
it
's
video
was
equally
groundbreaking
and
we
've
never
ever
met
a
person
capable
of
shutting
this
song
off
before
it
ended
.
watch
queen
's
'bohemian
rhapsody
'
video
watch
the
'wayne

what
queen
songs
rule
your
castle
queen
are
far
too
diverse
and
long-running
of
a
band
to
ever
have
their
career
boiled
down
to
just
10
songs
.

songs
would
be
