a
tale
of
two
cities
summary
back
next
how
it
all
goes
down
itâs
1775
.
trouble
is
a-brewinâ
in
the
french
countryside
.
apparently
the
folks
out
there
donât
like
to
be
starved
and
taxed
to
death
.
who
wouldâve
guessed
it
ehas
our
novel
starts
a
very
businessman-like
british
gentleman
makes
his
way
into
the
heart
of
paris
.
heâs
on
a
very
unsettling
mission
.
in
fact
itâs
almost
enough
to
make
a
businessman
cry
.
you
see
eighteen
years
ago
a
french
doctor
was
imprisoned
without
any
warning
or
any
trial
.
heâs
been
locked
up
in
the
worst
prison
of
all
prisons
the
bastille
.
after
almost
two
decades
he
was
released
â
again
without
any
explanation
â
and
heâs
currently
staying
with
an
old
servant
of
his
ernst
defarge
.
today
mr.
lorry
thatâs
our
british
businessman
is
on
a
mission
to
the
french
doctor
back
to
england
where
he
can
live
in
peace
with
his
daughter.dr
.
manette
may
be
free
but
heâs
still
a
broken
man
.
he
spends
most
of
his
time
cobbling
together
shoes
and
pacing
up
and
down
in
his
dark
room
.
too
accustomed
to
the
space
of
a
prison
to
understand
that
he
can
actually
leave
his
room
dr.
manette
seems
doomed
to
live
a
pitiful
life.fortunately
for
dr.
manette
and
for
mr.
lorry
now
that
we
think
about
it
he
happens
to
have
the
worldâs
perfect
daughter
.
lucie
the
child
he
left
eighteen
years
ago
is
now
a
grown-up
smiling
blond
perfect
ray
of
sunshine
.
everything
she
touches
seems
to
turn
to
gold
.
vomit
if
youâd
like
but
lucie
is
indeed
perfect
.
and
sheâll
need
every
ounce
of
that
perfection
to
restore
her
father
back
to
health.of
course
she
does
manage
to
bring
dr.
manette
back
into
the
everyday
world
.
we
never
doubted
her
for
a
second
.
within
the
space
of
five
years
thatâs
1780
for
those
of
you
who
are
counting
dr.
manette
is
a
new
man
.
heâs
a
practicing
doctor
again
he
and
lucie
live
in
a
small
house
in
soho
.
they
donât
have
much
money
dr.
manetteâs
cash
was
all
seized
in
france
but
lucie
manages
to
shine
her
rays
of
wonderfulness
over
their
lives
.
in
other
words
theyâre
pretty
happy
.
and
theyâve
adopted
mr.
lorry
as
a
sort
of
drop-in
uncle.as
we
pick
up
the
story
in
1780
dr.
manette
and
lucie
have
been
called
as
witnesses
in
a
treason
case
.
apparently
a
young
man
named
charles
darnay
is
accused
of
providing
classified
information
to
the
french
government
.
english
trials
at
the
time
resemble
smoke-and-mirror
tricks
dickens
takes
great
delight
in
mocking
the
``
esteemed
''
members
of
the
court
.
thanks
to
lucieâs
compassionate
testimony
and
some
quick
work
by
a
man
who
looks
strangely
like
charles
darnay
however
our
man
charles
is
off
the
hook.a
free
man
charles
darnay
immediately
realizes
just
how
perfect
our
perfect
lucie
actually
is
.
he
sets
up
shop
in
the
manette
house
coming
to
visit
almost
every
day
.
the
charles
look-alike
a
disreputable
but
letâs
face
it
really
likable
guy
called
sydney
carton
also
takes
a
liking
to
lucie
.
if
charles
is
shiny
and
good
and
perfect
sydney
isâ
not
any
of
those
things
.
he
also
likes
to
beat
himself
up
a
lot
.
in
fact
weâre
thinking
that
he
could
really
use
one
of
those
twelve-step
esteem
boosting
programs.sydney
loves
lucie
with
all
his
heart
but
heâs
convinced
that
he
could
never
deserve
her
.
what
does
he
do
well
he
tells
her
precisely
why
she
could
never
love
him
.
surprise
surprise
she
agrees
.
sheâd
like
to
help
him
be
a
better
person
but
he
would
rather
wallow
in
his
misery
.
after
all
wallowing
sounds
like
so
much
fun
doesnât
it
wallow
wallow
wallow
.
thatâs
sydney
in
a
nutshell.charles
meanwhile
fares
a
little
bit
better
.
he
marries
lucie
.
on
the
day
of
his
wedding
he
tells
dr.
manette
a
secret
heâs
actually
a
french
nobleman
in
disguise
.
a
very
particular
french
nobleman
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
marquis
evrãmonde
.
because
everything
in
a
dickens
novel
has
to
fit
into
a
neat
pattern
itâs
no
real
surprise
that
the
evrãmondes
were
the
evil
brothers
who
locked
dr.
manette
up
in
the
first
place
.
the
good
doctor
is
a
bit
shocked
of
course
but
he
eventually
realizes
that
charles
is
nothing
like
his
father
or
his
uncle
the
evil
evrãmondes
brothers
.
dr.
manette
is
willing
to
love
charles
for
the
man
he
is
not
the
family
he
left
behind.things
are
going
swimmingly
in
england
.
charles
moves
in
with
the
manettes
he
makes
a
decent
wage
as
a
tutor
and
dr.
manette
seems
to
be
as
happy
as
ever
.
but
wait
wasnât
this
a
tale
of
two
cities
what
happened
to
the
other
cityok
you
got
us
.
while
everythingâs
coming
up
roses
in
london
everythingâs
coming
up
dead
in
paris
.
we
only
wish
we
were
kidding
.
people
are
starving
the
noblemen
run
over
little
children
with
their
carriages
and
everyone
is
pretty
unhappy
.
in
fact
theyâre
so
unhappy
that
theyâre
beginning
to
band
together
as
``
citizens
''
of
a
new
republic
.
right
now
ernst
defarge
and
his
wife
are
at
the
center
of
a
revolutionary
group
.
we
can
tell
that
theyâre
revolutionary
because
theyâre
super-secret
.
and
they
also
call
each
other
``
jacques
.
''
thatâs
``
jack
''
in
french.in
the
village
of
the
evrãmondes
the
marquis
has
been
stabbed
in
the
night
.
gasp
the
government
hangs
the
killer
but
tensions
donât
ever
really
settle
down
.
finally
the
steward
of
the
evrãmonde
estate
sends
a
desperate
letter
to
the
new
marquis
because
folks
hated
the
old
marquis
so
much
theyâre
now
throwing
the
steward
into
prison.a
bunch
of
fluke
accidents
conspire
to
make
sure
that
charles
gets
the
letter
.
heâs
the
marquis
remember
even
though
heâs
thrown
off
his
old
title
and
his
old
lands
entirely
he
canât
help
but
feel
responsible
for
the
fate
of
this
steward
.
without
telling
his
wife
or
his
father-in-law
anything
about
whatâs
been
going
on
he
secretly
sets
off
for
france.unfortunately
for
charles
he
picked
a
bad
time
for
a
summer
vacation
.
by
the
time
he
arrives
on
the
shores
of
france
the
revolutionaries
have
overturned
the
country
.
the
king
is
about
to
be
beheaded
.
the
queen
soon
follows
suit
.
murder
and
vengeance
and
mob
mentality
are
all
boiling
over
.
immediately
detained
charles
soon
realizes
that
heâs
made
a
big
big
mistake
.
by
the
time
he
reaches
paris
heâs
become
a
prisoner
.
new
laws
dictate
that
heâs
going
to
be
executed
by
la
guillotine
.
fortunately
dr.
manette
hears
about
his
fate
.
with
lucie
in
tow
he
rushes
to
paris
.
it
turns
out
that
heâs
something
of
a
celebrity
there
anybody
who
was
falsely
arrested
under
the
aristocratic
rule
of
old
is
now
revered
as
one
of
the
heroes
of
the
new
republic
.
the
doctor
shows
up
at
charles
's
trial
and
wows
the
judges
with
his
heroic
plea
to
save
his
son-in-law.everything
seems
happy
again
.
sure
itâs
the
middle
of
the
french
revolution
but
the
manettes
and
charles
are
in
the
clear
.
or
at
least
thatâs
how
it
seems
for
a
few
hours
.
all
too
quickly
however
charles
is
arrested
again
.
this
time
the
defarges
have
accused
him
of
being
a
member
of
the
nobility
and
a
stain
on
the
countryâs
name.frantic
doctor
manette
tries
to
intervene
.
the
court
case
for
charlesâs
second
trial
goes
very
differently
from
the
first
one
though
.
ernst
defarge
produces
a
letter
written
by
dr.
manette
himself
which
condemns
charles
to
death.wait
a
second
dr.
manette
impossible
well
not
exactly
.
long
ago
dr.
manette
scribbled
down
the
history
of
his
own
imprisonment
and
secreted
it
in
a
wall
of
the
bastille
.
the
history
tells
a
sordid
tale
of
rape
and
murder
â
crimes
committed
by
charlesâs
father
and
brother
.
incensed
the
jury
of
french
revolutionary
``
citizens
''
decides
that
charles
should
pay
for
the
crimes
of
his
father.before
he
can
be
executed
however
sydney
carton
comes
to
the
rescue
.
a
few
good
tricks
and
a
couple
of
disguises
later
charles
is
a
free
man
.
he
and
his
family
head
back
to
england
in
relative
safety
.
sydney
however
doesnât
fare
so
well
.
he
takes
charlesâs
place
in
prison
and
dies
on
the
guillotine.crazy
huh
the
novel
however
thinks
that
his
sacrifice
is
pretty
heroic
.
and
weâve
got
to
say
we
agree
.
