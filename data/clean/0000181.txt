on

stuff
helps
thanks
for
makin
these
vids
bigdhardy
speaking
of
lifeless
the
reviews
here
are
excellent
.
a
good
thing
to
do
in
life
active
is
punching
the
face
of
idiots
using
cosplay
starwars
.
ve
done
this
several
times
with
my
brothers
i
recomend
guest
i
have
viewed
your
review
i
muat
say
i
dont
agree
with
your
synopsis
of
the
video
.
i
agree
that
the
phantom
menace
has
its
faults
and
flaws
but
its
obvious
that
you
grew
up
with
the
original
three
movies
and
have
a
closed
opinion
on
the
newer
ones
as
most
star
wars
fanboys
have
darkcyberelf
â
i
was
born
in
the
90s
and
was
about
8
or
9
years
old
when
i
first
saw
this
film
and
im
going
to
be
honest
i
didnt
know
what
the
hell
was
going
on
and
i
certainly
dont
know
now
.
it
is
the
most
confusing
and
pointless
of
the
star
wars
films
.
is
it
entertaining
yes
at
time
.
but
mostly
its
just
complete
shit
compared
to
the
simplicity
originality
and
development
the
original
trilogy
had
.
everything
this
guy
said
was
completely
valid
regardless
of
which
films
you
prefer
.
i
personally
like
this
film
but
for
illogical
reasons
.
this
movie
is
bad
.
this
is
the
worst
star
wars
movie
.
those
are
facts
he
has
just
proven
.
okorugaijin
the
security
chief
says
their
security
volunteers
which
makes
them
sound
like
mall
cops
or
concert
bouncersâthese
are
the
people
in
charge
of
protecting
the
queen
and
the
rest
of
the
planet
would
be
no
match
againsta
battle-hardened
federation
army
what
when
the
big
final
battle
takes
place
theyre
almost
entirely
fighting
regiments
of
droids
.
the
term
battle-hardened
refers
to
someone
who
has
been
through
numerous
wars
and
conflicts
and
has
had
their
sensitivities
resilience
and
training
steeled
over
as
a
result
.
usually
this
person
is
pretty
valuable
in
a
fight
.
battle-hardened
would
be
appropriate
if
you
were
referring
to
like
a
human
or
some
other
type
of
carbon-based
life
form
that
could
experience
things
like
fear
pain
or
emotion
.
but
these
are
fucking
robots
.
the
most
life-like
thing
they
do
is
say
roger
roger
back
to
the
giant
computer
that
probably
controls
them
.
theyre
not
the
fucking
uruk-hai
.
besides
from
the
way
the
jedi
cut
these
things
in
half
by
the
dozen
id
say
theyre
pretty
expendablenot
valuable
.
theyre
like
cheap
plastic
toys
that
all
look
the
same
cue
were
in
the
money
music
.
as
soon
as
one
gets
demolished
it
just
gets
replaced
by
another
on
that
looks
exactly
the
same
and
has
the
same
orders
.
they
dont
need
to
be
battle-hardened
from
numerous
conflicts
.
cablecar830
i
agree
with
your
point
that
he
seems
like
he
loved
the
originals
too
much
but
a
lot
of
it
was
pretty
pointless
but
overall
i
love
all
of
the
films
its
more
than
a
story
its
a
legend
and
everyone
that
picks
on
it
in
way
too
much
detail
isnt
aware
that
george
lucas
made
it
the
way
he
wanted
to
and
now
hed
got
billions

so
good

incredible
quality
of
analysis

production
in
this
video

why
i
like
it
is
that
its
fucking
funny
.
how
long
do
these
take
to
produce

you
have
a

material
and
edit

sincerely
dont

it

just
like
how
russia

the
joke
is
hes
deliberately
getting
the
names

historical
events
wrong
you
fucking
idiot
.
http
its
funny
john
johnson
imho
1
.
when
you
have
a
story
that
cant
really
hold
up
to
a
complicated
scrutiny
of
plot
details
like
sw
as
opposed
to
star
trek
which
can
work
as
a
nerd
niche
you
really
have
to
focus
on
universal
elements
of
storytelling
and
visuals
you
cant
just
have
a
bunch
of
mindless
logistical
dialogue
that
creates
all
these
new
rules
.
thats
why
this
is
fantasy
in
space
as
opposed
to
sci-fi
its
supposed
to
be
fucking
universal
and
accessible
2
.
anakin
should
have
been
the
luke
of
the
prequels
starting
ep1
the
same
age
as
luke
in
epiv
.
lucas
could
have
just
aped
the
sequels
and
no
one
would
have
faulted
him
.
no
one
wanted
godfather
here
just
sw.
making
the
character
of
anakin
switch
actors
33
of
the
way
through
the
trilogy
is
absolutely
mind
boggling
obviously
the
reasoning
was
now
it
gots
a
little
kid
the
closest
i
can
get
to
identifying
a
protagonist
in
this
mess
is
ep1
obiwan
qui-gon
and
anakin
are
all
the
protagonist
.
ep2
obiwan
and
anakin
are
both
the
protagonist
.
ep3
anakin
is
the
protagonist
3
.
anakin
and
obiwans
friendship
doesnt
make
very
much
sense
due
to
their
age
difference
of
ill
say
at
least
10
years
.
actually
the
way
these
movies
work
its
almost
as
if
anakin
catches
up
in
age
to
obiwan
.
this
movie
is
13
years
old
and
i
still
cant
forget
how
much
of
a
clusterfuck
it
was
.
john
johnson
a
bigger
idiot
than
you
what
a
conundrum
.
cameron
is
an
asshole
which
the
painfully
terrible
tv
series
or
the
animated
film
that
got
19
percent
http
michael
technically
the
uruk-hai
were
made
right
before
helms
deep
meaning
they
werent
battle-hardened
either
at
least
thats
my
recollection
http
the
uruk-hai
were
active
in
the
events
of
the
first
book
where
they
attack
the
fellowship
and
kill
boromir
.
they
also
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
fighting
small
bands
of
rohirim
and
raiding
settlements
.
so
they
were
not
wholly
untested
but
neither
had
they
faced
determined
resistance
with
out
most
of
them
being
killed
tom
am
i
the
only
one
slightly
put
off
by
the
fact
that
padme
seems
about
three
times
annakins
age
in
the
first
movie
yet
by
the
third
anakin
seems
slightly
older
bananna
hammock
apparently
you
missed
the
big
if
right
before
that
statement
.
grandam
the
prequels
are
such
a
colossal
failure
because
they
lack
the
most
basic
elements
that
make
a
movie
worth
watching
.
it
lacks
characters
and
a
coherent
story
.
its
as
if
they
took
all
the
old
star
wars
staples
and
electrofied
them
.
they
didnt
bother
with
a
story
or
characters
.
its
totally
obvious
.
im
not
a
writer
and
i
could
have
made
a
better
story
.
heres
something
just
off
the
top
of
my
head
.
it
wouldnt
be
that
hard
to
do
and
it
ties
up
the
story
nicely
to
coincide
with
the
start
of
a
new
hope
.
obiwan
is
a
younger
more
hotheaded
jedi
than
in
the
original
trilogy
.
he
finds
anakin
and
wants
to
train
him
because
he
senses
his
potential
with
the
force
.
when
he
asks
the
permission
of
the
jedi
council
they
deny
him
the
opportunity
so
he
trains
him
in
secret
.
yoda
finds
out
that
obiwan
is
secretly
training
anakin
and
has
anakin
brought
into
the
jedi
order
so
obiwan
doesnt
get
into
trouble
.
anakin
advances
through
his
training
quickly
.
he
becomes
more
and
more
powerful
but
hes
reckless
and
prone
to
giving
in
to
his
emotions
.
the
council
is
wary
of
this
and
slows
his
training
and
ascent
through
the
ranks
.
anakin
starts
to
become
impatient
with
the
council
always
doubting
him
.
he
believes
theyre
jealous
and
scared
of
his
true
potential
.
palpatine
talks
to
anakin
tells
him
that
there
is
another
group
that
uses
the
force
that
would
allow
him
to
advance
much
quicker
and
to
attain
even
greater
power
with
the
force
.
anakin
slowly
turns
to
the
dark
side
becoming
more
and
more
distant
to
the
jedi
order
.
obiwan
realizes
this
and
eventually
finds
out
that
anakin
is
consorting
with
a
sith
lord
.
he
eventually
confronts
anakin
and
duels
him
in
an
effort
to
stop
him
.
obiwan
wins
the
duel
but
cant
bring
himself
to
kill
anakin
.
instead
he
leaves
him
severely
maimed
hoping
that
this
will
stop
his
quest
for
power
.
this
is
where
anakin
becomes
darth
vader
.
filled
with
hatred
for
the
jedi
particularly
his
old
friend
obiwan
he
works
with
palpatine
to
eliminate
the
jedi
council
as
theyre
the
only
group
that
has
any
real
power
to
oppose
him
.
all
the
jedi
are
hunted
down
and
eliminated
only
a
few
manage
to
escape
.
obiwan
takes
baby
luke
and
heads
off
to
tatooine
leaving
baby
leia
to
the
organas
on
alderaan
.
he
does
this
out
of
fear
that
darth
vaders
children
would
be
equally
as
powerful
with
the
force
and
that
theyd
be
corrupted
to
the
dark
side
.
he
goes
into
hiding
on
tatooine
so
he
can
watch
luke
while
avoiding
being
killed
in
the
ensuing
hunt
for
the
remaining
jedi
.
he
also
hides
out
of
shame
for
having
brought
the
end
of
the
jedi
order
which
had
existed
for
thousands
of
generations
.
yoda
flees
to
dagobah
because
he
fears
the
jedi
order
is
destroyed
and
there
is
nothing
else
he
can
do
to
change
that
.
fill
that
basic
outline
with
scenes
depicting
obiwan
and
anakin
going
through
adventures
and
youd
have
a
much
better
trilogy
.

to

i
dont
even
know

http
you
better
get
out
before
plinkett
explains
to
you
how
much
of

you
are

gets
pretty
murderous
when
he
explains
things
.
http
nobodys
saying
there
wasnt
a
blockade
in

its
just
that
the
joke
was
self-evidently
about
confusing
historical
event
to
someone
who
took
even
the
smallest
second
to
ponder
it
.
the
point
is
just
so
youre
still
a
fucking
idiot
for
not
thinking
things
through
before
you
committed
yourself
to
a
full-on
comment
on
the
internet

hes
a

point

doing
unreasonable
things

hes
more
contemplative

brilliant
analysis
q.
http
i
really
like
the
three
old
movies
because
of
the
story
and
the
great
idea
but
what
captured
my
attention
in
the
star
wars
saga
was
exactly
what
isnt
considered
so
good
the
action
.
although
it
does
not
fit
well
in
the
universe
of
star
wars
the
paper
of
the
action
in
the
new
trilogy
is
to
attract
the
new
audience
making
it
justified
.
and
what
sabotages
the
new
movies
is
the
numbers
of
details
that
were
tried
to
be
put
in
the
movie
because
of
the
lack
of
answers
in
the
old
trilogy
.
they
put
a
lot
of
details
because
they
needed
not
only
to
tell
a
new
story
but
to
explain
an
already
existed
one
this
makes
difficult
to
conceal
and
the
problems
are
seen
more
easily
.
as
a
17
years
old
nerd
i
would
put
the
films
in
this
order
worst
i
iii
iv
ii
v
vi
-best
.
i
would
put
this
in
my
opinion
that
nobody
needs
to
share
if
you
dont
will
to
because
of
the
action
involved
and
the
story
.
and
in
the
problems
in
the
story
appeared
not
only
in
the
new
trilogy
who
would
put
a
week
point
in
a
massive
weapon
like
the
death
star
why
there
is
a
hole
that
take
it
to
the
reactor
it
doesnt
makes
sense
at
all
.

jarjar4evr
please
review
return
of
the
jedi
i
know
everyone
refers
to
star
wars
as
some
immaculate
and
flawless
trilogy
of
sci-fi
perfection
but
have
any
of
you
seen
rotj
recently
episode
iv
was
breathtaking
and
revolutionary
episode
v
picked
up
from
where
it
left
off
and
added
an
intensity
the
first
was
missing
and
delved
deeper
into
the
themes
and
characters
star
wars
created
then
episode
vi
came
along
and
fucked
everything
up
.
youve
done
an
excellent
job
of
explaining
why
episodes
i-iii
are
unbearable
pieces
of
shit
so
why
omit
return
of
the
jedi
that
movie
is
the
worst
of
the
ot
by
far
and
id
argue
the
worst
of
the
saga
.
the
only
reason
an
adult
would
enjoy
that
movie
is
if
they
saw
it
as
a
child
and
are
incapable
of
viewing
it
objectively
.
all
of
the
terrible
qualities
of
the
prequels
are
there
.
go
and
give
it
a
rewatch
i
implore
you
.
halde
how
ironic
.
was
about
to
watch
this
when
i
see
a
clone
wars
animated
series
blueray
commercial
by
dvdoo.com
xd
http
so
disney
have
bought
lucasfilm
and
announced
three
more
star
wars
movies
.
get
your
notebook
ready
mike
.
guest
your
alternative
is
generic
and
highly
cliche
but
coherent
and
understandable
.
at
its
core
lucas
script
for
episodes
i
ii
and
iii
is
very
much
the
same
.
its
generic
and
not
particularly
clever
but
its
coherent
.
think
about
it
if
i
simplified
the
story
to
its
most
basic
elements
wed
get
something
that
sounds
as
palatable
as
your
own
proposal
.
obi
wan
is
a
young
somewhat
impulsive
jedi
being
mentored
by
liemni
sohn
a
powerful
jedi
master
.
while
traveling
a
barren
desert
world
they
stumble
across
a
young
boy
named
anakin
whose
innate
potential
with
the
force
is
so
great
that
it
astonishes
both
of
them
.
obi-wan
senses
that
he
is
destined
for
great
things
and
covets
the
chance
to
be
the
one
who
trains
him
allowing
his
desire
to
do
so
to
cloud
his
normally
sound
judgment
.
the
young
anakin
grows
in
power
but
as
he
enters
his
tumultuous
adolescence
he
chafes
under
what
he
feels
is
the
oppression
of
the
jedi
order
.
at
the
core
of
his
rebellion
is
a
disagreement
the
jedi
order
demands
that
its
adherents
master
and
suppress
their
emotion
because
failure
to
do
so
has
led
jedi
in
the
past
to
wield
their
power
to
do
horrible
things
in
pursuit
of
their
passions
.
anakin
does
not
understand
this
and
wouldnt
agree
with
it
even
if
he
did
.
all
he
sees
is
that
the
order
is
trying
to
keep
him
from
the
woman
he
loves
passionately
.
he
carries
on
his
quiet
rebellion
out
of
the
sights
of
the
jedi
order
.
some
of
the
higher-ups
know
but
keep
their
eyes
half-shut
because
on
some
level
they
feel
the
code
is
too
strict
as
well
.
anakin
grows
in
power
and
begins
to
perceive
new
subtleties
in
the
force
.
one
day
tapping
deeply
into
it
he
has
a
vision
that
terrifies
him
of
his
beautiful
wife
dying
.
he
refuses
to
accept
that
this
is
true
.
he
fights
to
try
to
find
a
way
around
it
.
everything
he
knows
about
the
force
suggests
that
what
hes
seen
is
unavoidable
.
finally
hes
faced
with
a
choice
accept
that
his
wife
has
to
die
or
throw
away
every
shred
of
the
things
hes
been
taught
in
a
desperate
bid
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
force
the
side
hes
been
taught
is
evil
there
may
be
an
answer
for
him
.
meanwhile
on
the
other
side
a
very
powerful
and
intelligent
evil
sees
this
and
senses
an
opportunity
to
turn
one
of
the
most
powerful
jedi
ever
produced
into
his
loyal
servant
.
all
he
has
to
do
is
lie
and
tell
the
young
man
that
on
the
dark
side
there
really
is
a
way
to
save
his
wife
.
and
so
anikin
allows
himself
to
be
corrupted
and
by
the
time
he
realizes
what
is
happening
hes
too
late
to
change
what
hes
become
or
the
horrible
things
he
has
done
.
he
wakes
to
find
hes
a
slave
to
a
new
master
.
fill
that
basic
outline
with
scenes
depicting
obiwan
and
anakin
going
through
adventures
and
youd
have
a
pretty
decent
trilogy
or
well
you
might
.
the
problem
is
not
the
basic
plot
idea
that
lucas
used
.
the
problem
is
how
he
fleshed
it
out
.
he
took
the
simple
central
narrative
of
the
first
three
episodes
which
could
have
been
brilliant
in
the
hands
of
somebody
who
cared
about
things
like
logic
and
coherency
and
buried
it
under
several
layers
of
shit
neglect
and
bad
acting
.
he
made
no
apparent
effort
to
screen
it
for
internal
contradictions
apparently
never
asked
himself
if
the
characters
were
believable
and
didnt
bother
to
go
out
of
his
way
to
bring
a
great
performance
out
of
the
actors
.
and
he
did
this
because
he
is
at
hart
an
effects
man
.
he
loves
graphics
.
he
wanted
to
build
a
wonderful
and
complex
world
and
to
use
computer
graphics
to
create
a
visual
cinematic
experience
that
was
like
nothing
seen
before
.
and
he
did
that
and
brilliantly
.
but
in
his
rush
to
do
that
he
thought
he
could
get
away
with
neglecting
the
other
half
of
the
moviethe
story
that
ties
it
all
together
.
and
thats
where
he
fell
apart
and
why
i
hate
the
first
trilogy
so
much
.
anakins
desperate
battle
against
fate
isnt
the
problem
.
its
that
lucas
makes
him
act
so
insipid
and
stupid
that
the
audience
feels
he
turned
to
the
dark
side
because
he
was
a
whiny
man-bitch
and
not
because
he
was
a
desperate
and
brilliant
jedi
who
was
at
heart
just
a
boy
trying
to
save
the
girl
he
loved
.
lucas
didnt
treat
a
single
plot
idea
he
had
with
the
respect
it
deserved
.
and
he
and
the
rest
of
us
paid
for
it
.
james
h.
i
like
your
alternative
.
its
a
bit
generic
and
i
dont
mean
that
in
a
rude
way
and
predicated
on
the
idea
that
anakin
was
kind
of
rotten
to
begin
with
but
its
coherent
and
i
think
that
youre
absolutely
right
that
it
would
have
made
a
good
framework
for
the
first
three
episodes
if
it
was
treated
properly
.
i
get
the
feeling
that
lucas
wanted
to
play
up
the
tragic
hero
angle
and
thats
why
he
went
the
direction
he
did
.
but
i
do
disagree
with
you
about
one
strong
point
.
i
dont
think
that
the
problem
with
star
wars
i
ii
and
iii
is
the
central
narrative
.
at
its
core
lucas
script
for
episodes
i
ii
and
iii
is
very
much
the
same
as
your
own
.
its
coherent
and
understandable
and
could
serve
as
the
basis
for
a
great
film
but
only
if
treated
properly
.
think
about
it
if
i
simplified
the
story
to
its
most
basic
elements
wed
get
something
that
sounds
as
palatable
as
your
own
proposal
.
something
like
this
obi
wan
is
a
young
somewhat
impulsive
jedi
being
mentored
by
liemni
sohn
a
powerful
jedi
master
.
while
traveling
a
barren
desert
world
they
stumble
across
a
young
boy
named
anakin
whose
innate
potential
with
the
force
is
so
great
that
it
astonishes
both
of
them
.
obi-wan
senses
that
he
is
destined
for
great
things
and
covets
the
chance
to
be
the
one
who
trains
him
allowing
his
desire
to
do
so
to
cloud
his
normally
sound
judgment
.
the
young
anakin
grows
in
power
but
as
he
enters
his
tumultuous
adolescence
he
chafes
under
what
he
feels
is
the
oppression
of
the
jedi
order
.
at
the
core
of
his
rebellion
is
a
disagreement
the
jedi
order
demands
that
its
adherents
master
and
suppress
their
emotion
because
failure
to

has

what

you

it
really
wasnt

complicated
.
sex

act
back
dan
i
think
the
worst
parts
are
the
endless
droning
on
in
luke
and
vaders
lightsaber
battle
.
it
was
trying
to
build
suspense
but
it
just
got
boring
.
and
also
i
dont
mind
the
ewoks
as
much
as
most
but
they
should
have
played
a
smaller
role
.
that
being
said
the
speeder
chase
in
the
forest
was
pretty
cool
.
and
what
you
said
about
seeing
it
as
a
kid
i
saw
both
the
old
trilogy
on
vhs
not
the
shitty
remade
dvds
and
the
prequels
as
a
kid
.
personally
i
think
that
people
give
the
prequels
too
much
shit
and
that
they
had
too
high
of
expectations
going
into
it
.
also
my
personal
favorite
is
esb
.
it
is
the
most
thoughtful
and
conflicted
one
.
cthulhugamete
my
only
gripe
with
this
the
best
review
of
this
steaming
pile
of
shit
of
a
movie
is
mo
mention
of
kurosawa
godard
or
bergman
might
be
shy
an
italian
or
two
.
and
i
know
hes
an
acquired
taste
but
esp
.
if
your
a
painter
greenaways
movies
are
a
visual
candy
shop
.
since
the
disney
buyout
and
discussions
about
the
next
possible
film
ive
encountered
some
thru
the
eyes
of
a
child
apologists
for
this
trope
fest
.
just
needed
a
reminder
that
i
wasnt
losing
mind
.
this
is
a
terrible
movie
and
needs
to
be
remembered
as
such
.
besides
maul
the
only
redeeming
quality
of
pm
is
that
comparatively
it
makes
the
ewoks
bearable
.
cthulhugamete
no
mention
of
kurosawa

alex
ok
so
the

rings
the

makes
a

as

not
gives
a

from
which
point
on
the

they
take
off
cuz
in

theres
no
ups
and

so
why
to
go

the

ring
go

back

alex
now
i
see
what
who
d
made
lucas
sell
his
company
to
disney
.
nicely
done
darthbaneforever
im
still
a
fan
of
the
star
wars
prequels
i
cant
wait
to
see
episodes
7
8
and
9
orbis
but
the
irony
is
that
even
the
special
effects
are
not
that
good
the
cgi
looks
really
fake
for
example
terminator
2
made
10
years
before
had
better
special
effects
than
episode
2
also
the
special
effects
are
none
near
as
ground
braking
as
the
original
star
wars
piwiator
ok
so
i
used
shazam
and
nothing
came
up
what
is
the
name
of
the
song
at
the
end
of
his
reviews
ninjacat
the
fact
that
the
droids
get
cut
down
like
butter
is
only
a
problem
if
you
look
at
tpm
as
a
stand
alone
movie
and
everyone
in
the
audience
knew
they
were
seeing
only
13rd
of
a
trilogy
.
1
the
seeming
superiority
of
the
jedi
.
what
makes
their
eventual
fall
so
dramatic
is
the
destruction
of
their
status
as
nearly
invincible
figures
.
this
has
to
happen
out
of
order
from
the
original
trilogy
in
order
to
make
narrative
sense
.
the
jedi
start
with
power
and
lose
to
evil
rather
than
start
as
goodie
underdogs
.
its
ok
that
their
primary
opponents
are
incompetent
in
the
first
movie
since
youve
already
accepted
that
you
are
in
for
a
trilogy
.
faulting
this
aspect
of
the
first
film
after
the
whole
trilogy
was
a
failure
is
unfair
.
2
the
superiority
of
the
clones
versus
droids
.
ever
wonder
why
the
empire
would
bother
training
and
using
live
humans
or
at
least
humanoids
under
those
stormtrooper
outfits
rather
than
mass
produce
a
bunch
of
robots
i
certainly
wondered
that
as
a
kid
.
this
was
actually
a
clever
way
to
answer
that
question
by
showing
the
incompetence
and
unreliability
of
the
mass
produced
machine
and
eventual
necessity
of
the
mass
produced
cloned
soldier
.
3
queens
are
more
exciting
than
rooks
.
the
lack
of
tension
throughout
the
film
was
the
result
of
mostly
absent
villains
and
a
long
drought
of
story
spent
on
the
silly
pod
race
.
what
would
a
more
competent
droid
army
accomplish
the
audience
isnt
there
to
watch
the
conflict
with
the
droids
they
are
there
for
the
conflict
with
the
sith
the
story
of
luke
and
leias
birth
and
anakins
descent
into
the
dark
side
.
the
fact
that
very
little
of
the
story
has
any
relevance
to
these
conflicts
is
more
damning
than
whether
the
droids
were
worthy
adversaries
.
love
the
reviews
just
disagree
on
a
few
things
.
http
i
always
thought
the
droids
were
the
protagonists..
in
all
honesty
i
feel
that
way
about
all
six
movies..
chuck
groin
punch
the
uruk_hais
uncanny
fighting
ability
can
at
least
be
explained
away
through
magic
because
tolkien
was
never
stupid
enough

the
prequels
are
stylistically
designed
to
be
that
way
but
we
can
dimish
the
effects
of
it
not
paying
to
see
the
movies
.
johnny_dk
i
like
the
battel
droide
jw6
you
can
rationalize
it
however
you
want
but
i
am
99.5
sure
that
lucas
was
not
thinking
anything
you
said
here
so
those
points
of
criticism
are
totally
accurate
.
no
theres
a
conspiracy
theory
i
heard
that
the
whole
reason
george
made
the
prequels
is
to
show
how
shitty
the
old
republic
was
.
after
the
6th
movie
there
was
an
invasion
by
a
species
that
turns
planets
into
organic
ships
in
a
matter
of
days
if
palpatine
knew
this
in
advance
then
itd
be
freaking
genius
to
overthrow
the
republic
to
protect
it
.
jesus
christ
look
how
retarded
both
the
senate
and
the
jedi
are
in
dealing
with
a
bunch
of
fucking
retarded
droids
.
the
empire
has
trillions
of
troops
and
has
a
station
that
can
blow
up
motherfucking
planets
ya
know
ones
that
couldve
been
turned
into
genocidal
spaceships
.
but
yeah
the
sith
are
the
bad
guys
the
rebellion
just
caused
the
genocides
of
a
dozen
or
so
species
.
grandam
lucas
has
a
very
poor
track
record
with
movies
.
plinkett
says
that
lucas
gets
too
much
credit
for
star
wars
and
i
agree
.
i
wouldnt
trust
lucas
with
any
movie
if
i
wanted
it
to
be
more
than
eye
candy
.
you
could
say
my
idea
for
the
story
is
similar
to
his
but
he
doesnt
tell
the
story
very
well
at
all
.
so
its
hard
to
tell
if
its
actually
similar
or
not
.
its
as
if
he
added
in
so
much
crap
because
he
wanted
it
to
be
epic
.
it
became
convoluted
and
bogged
down
with
meaningless
scenes
.
the
first
sequel
could
be
thrown
out
entirely
and
it
wouldnt
change
the
story
at
all
.
that
is
the
problem
.
he
told
a
story
that
could
fill
one
movie
spread
it
over
three
and
filled
the
void
with
pointless
action
and
visuals
.
but
when
he
filled
the
void
he
watered
down
the
story
so
that
it
is
hard
to
follow
and
understand
.
zero_miles_per_hour
i
think
there
might
have
been
an
earlier
draft
where
its
explained
that
the
trade
federation
is
an
alliance
of
the
most
wealthy
planets
and
the
sith
are
manipulating
them
through
their
greed
to
destroy
the
republic
from
within
and
padme
is
a
threat
because
shes
trying
to
make
a
counter-alliance
.
this
would
explain
their
name
their
robot
armies
and
their
desire
to
kill
padme
.
pod
such
stupid
reviews
zero_miles_per_hour
it
seems
to
me
like
what
they
should
have
done
is
not
make
the
jedi
avoid
romance
instead
they
should
avoid
politics
.
like
they
could
make
anakin
secretly
have
a
crush
on
senator
padme
who
is
organizing
a
counter-alliance
against
the
trade
federation
and
gets
kidnapped
by
the
apprentice
sith
because
palpatine
is
backing
the
trade
federation
to
destroy
the
republic
from
within
so
anakin
will
agree
to
help
the
republic
save
padme
using
the
alias
darth
vader
so
the
jedi
wont
know
but
hes
not
powerful
enough
to
do
it
and
palpatine
is
drawn
by
his
force
and
his
immense
rage
and
convinces
him
to
become
his
apprentice
with
the
promise
of
godlike
power
without
realizing
that
this
will
result
in
the
death
of
his
other
apprentice
and
this
causes
anakin
to
become
darth
vader
permanently
and
also
married
to
padme
and
worshipped
by
the
republic
as
their
savior
so
palpatine
decides
to
abandon
the
trade
federation
and
use
his
new
apprentice
to
weasel
his
way
into
the
republic
meanwhile
the
jedi
have
figured
out
the
darth
vader
thing
by
now
and
come
to
stop
it
but
anakin
personally
slaughters
them
all
except
yoda
whos
too
powerful
and
obi-wan
who
was
the
only
jedi
he
actually
knew
personally
but
using
that
much
force
in
one
battle
nearly
kills
him
so
the
republic
builds
him
the
suit
and
the
two
remaining
jedis
flee
and
turn
the
trade
federation
into
the
rebel
alliance
eventually
joined
by
padme
who
flees
with
her
and
anakins
kids
when
palpatine
turns
the
republic
into
the
empire
.
kevin
nice
idea
where
did
anakins
kids
come
from
though
http
yeah
that
is
fucked
up
.
i
think
shes
supposed
to
be
like
seven
eight
or
nine
years
older
.
i
always
thought
she
was
a
bit
of
a
cougar
.
but
what
you
pointed
out
makes
no
sense
.
i_the_r
maybe
they
are
saying
that
the
steel
that
the
droids
are
made
out
of
has
been
hardened
to
optimal
battle
specs
thus
making
them
battle-hardened
.
http
tropes
are
not
bad
.
http
i
think
you
can
attribute
that
oversight
to
the
fact
that
nobody
gives
a
shit
about
maul
.
the
only
time
he
was
ever
cool
was
on
the
posters
and
shit
before
you
saw
the
movie
.
it
made
you
think
he
was
going
to
be
a
cool
bad
guy
and
a
part
of
the
story
but
it
was
just
a
bait
and
switch
like
sam
jackson
.
potential
isnt
really
the
word
because
all
maul
is
is
a
stuntman
with
spikes
on
his
head
.
yeaidontthinkso
too
long

na
listen
.
dear
butthurt
basement
dweller
it
helps
to
actually
explain
and
rationalize
your
accusations
and
criticisms
of
a
movie
.
not
bring
up
a
point
and
immediately
cut
away
to
some
long
winded
rant
that
only
serves
to
make
fun
of
it
never
once
delivering
any
message
or
comparative
reasoning
to
support
your
original
point
.
when
you
actually
do
manage
to
make
a
reasonable
point
you
fail
to
realize
that
it
is
just
another
common
movie
fallacy
.
on
this
note
for
every
whining
you
have
against
tpm
i
could
find
the
same
criticism
in
the
original
trilogy
.
it
was
full
of
just
as
many
tropes
and
irrational
decisions
the
only
difference
is
you
choose
to
deny
that
out
of
fandom
.
this
isnt
any
sort
of
a
review
its
an
hour
of
you
crying
because
you
dont
like
anything
new
.
the
mere
fact
you
went
into
seeing
this
movie
with
an
already
preconceived
notion
that
it
was
going
to
suck
should
be
reason
enough
to
dismiss
any
possibility
of
sound
criticism
.
rob
too
long
not
gon
na
listen
.
thats
the
mentality
of
a
dumb
child
.
no
wonder
youre
defending
the
prequels
.

http
i
have
not
laughed
this
much
in
a
very
very
long
time
.
my

mates
actually
came

i
was
ok.
haha
puttanesca
omg
im
watching
it
again

all
i
have
in
my

is
mr

views

http
would
have
worked
a
lot
better
if
anakin
just
rose
through
the
ranks
of
the
jedi
while
dealing
with
the
clone
wars
alongside
obi
wan
leaving
the
prequels
on
a
high
note
and
forcing
us
to
fill
in
the
blanks
as
far
as
his
transition
into
darth
vader
.
the
clone
wars
could
have
been
something
a
lot
more
emotional-
like
maybe
the
clones
were
all
abominations
created
by
a
widowed
scientist
trying
to
resurrect
his
lost
love-
theyre
all
mutated
horrors
and
this
causes
the
galactic
senate
to
intervene-
creating
a
wwi-esque
conflict-
the
senate
occupying
planet
after
planet
to
continue
their
manhunt
until
the
alliance
fractures-
with
planets
pointing
fingers
and
forming
ententes
.
war
threatens
to
break
out
add
ravage
the
galaxy
which
all
serves
as
a
backdrop
to
the
quest
that
obi
and
anakin
embark
on
hoping
to
find
the
scientist
and
pull
the
galaxy
back
from
the
brink
.
the
scientist
could
even
have
been
long
dead
by
the
time
they
find
him-
the
victory
of
the
jedi
is
incomplete
and
were
left
with
a
galaxy
barely
held
together
with
tense
one-eye-open
alliances
.

man

wow
i
never
realized
how
bad
this
movie
is
.
i
watched
it
in
the
theater
with
my
parents
back
then
when
it
came
out
and
all
i
remembered
was
jar
jar
binks
pod
racing
and
the
final
battle
with
the
guy
with
double-bladed
lightsaber
and
they
made
a
3d
version
of
this
charnelhouse
interesting
approach
.
i
would
not
start
episode
i
with
obi
wan
as
a
jedi
.
i
would
reach
back
further
to
his
line
in
to
yoda
in
empire
strikes
back
was
i
any
different
when
you
taught
me
we
have
thus
established
that
yoda
taught
obi
wan
to
be
a
jedi
.
why
abandon
that
episode
i
should
have
been
about
yoda
discovering
obi
wan
and
training
him
to
become
a
jedi
.
then
the
emperor
tempts
him
with
the
dark
side
and
he
refuses
.
or
something
as
long
as
your
fill
out
obi
wans
backstory
.
but
keep
the
focus
on
the
core
characters
without
introducing
all
the
static

jfbrian
at

of
part

are
they
looking
out
a
window
or
is
that
supposed
to
be
a
viewscreen
it
looks
like
a
window
to
me
but
they
are
looking
out
it
at
an
upward
angle
and
seeing
straight
down
into
the
street
.
ziggy
this
is
probably
the
most
educational
video
ive
ever
watched
cereus
remember
when
jar
jar
spits
out
that
weird
shovel
headed
salamander
the
thing
that
i
just
remembered
is
why
he
spits
it
out
because
he
finds
out
how
much
it
costs
.
how
does
a
fucking
moron
from
an
insular
society
who
has
lived
in
the
fucking
woods
alone
for
years
understand
the
currency
of
a
planet
he
probably
hadnt
heard
of
before
he
most
likely
has
a
very
basic
understanding
of
non
gungan
naboo
culture
if
that
.
so
yeah
very
minor
point
but
ive
just
been
realising
how
little
time
goes
by
between
stupid
shit
in
this
movie
.
guest
what
is
it
with
ricks
you
forgot
santorum
.
cegolal
oh
this
is
just
great
.
a
stupid
review
site
full
of
nerdy
stupid
explanations
trying
to
put
some
value
to
stupid
flaws
just
because
theyre
old
.
lets
just
start
once
again
the
bullshit-counter
job
first
of
all
im
not
even
start
defending
the
script
of
phantom
menace
in
general
.
it
is
a
great
movie
with
great
story
.
ill
just
comment
your
reasons
.
the
need
of
a
protagonist
the
audience
needs
a
protagonist
who
the
hell
told
you
that
you
are
bound
to
the
past
where
all
action
movies
followed
the
very
same
linear
structure
repeated
over
and
over
again
due
to
lack
of
creativity
.
only
1
person
and
his
problems
filling
the
whole
picture
.
the
most
stupid
things
on
the
older
movies
was
the
centering
around
luke
.
nobody
knew
shit
about
the
rest
of
the
galaxy
.
what
is
the
senate
where
is
it
empire
of
what
you
see
dagobah
hoth
tattoine
and
endor
and
none
of
them
has
any
trace
of
government
.
the
only
place
you
see
that
has
the
slight
sign
of
administration
is
bespin
and
thats
not
even
an
important
place
in
the
whole
galaxy
.
from
that
you
have
to
imagine
how
is
the
rest
of
the
galaxy
.
i
remember
that
when
i
was
a
kid
most
people
used
to
think
that
the
whole
empire
was
just
an
empire
of
spaceships
that
dominated
underdeveloped
planets
and
thats
all
and
the
worst
thing
is
that
according
to
iv
v
and
vi
thats
acceptable
.
even
more
the
whole
universe
is
at
war
but
all
you
see
is
the
adventures
of
luke
.
how
stupid
is
that
i
cant
blame
lucas
.
he
said
himself
that
he
regrets
not
having
the
tech
or
money
to
make
the
story
as
wide
as
it
should
be
at
the
time
.
centering
on
luke
is
a
limitation
not
something
to
be
praised
.
the
i
ii
and
iii
rightfully
placed
the
characters
stories
below
or
at
least
in
the
same
level
as
the
rest
of
the
universe
what
shouldve
been
done
to
the
iv
v
and
vi
as
well
.
sorry
but
all
i
see
here
is
someone
complaining
about
not
having
a
boring
1
person
story
about
a
single
individual
saving
the
whole
universe
in
his
every
move
what
is
really
ridiculous
to
think
even
for
a
country
what
to
say
for
a
whole
galaxy
.
im
really
glad
that
lucas
fixed
that
and
that
now
i
can
see
that
the
whole
galaxy
is
not
made
of
1
person
.
description
of
characters
ill
pretty
much
get
into
your
game
.
han
solo
hes
a
rogue
.
he
got
a
strange
facial
expression
and
keeps
uninitentionally
smilling
due
to
lack
of
interpretation
from
h.
ford
that
only
do
serious
roles
.
all
of
his
faces
are
overly
expressed
like
he
is
doing
mimics
with
too
widely
opened
eyes
like
japanese
theater
wich
is
great
but
totally
incoherent
for
a
movie
.
from
the
whole
cast
he
was
the
only
one
that
made
me
see
that
it
was
an
actor
not
a
character
always
speaking
as
if
there
was
a
third
person
seeing
him
act
.
qui
gon
he
is
very
calm
and
experienced
.
know
what
to
do
even
at
the
worst
time
possible
and
is
very
patient
.
everything
is
under
his
control
but
if
something
isnt
he
doesnt
mind
breaking
some
rules
and
being
a
little
rebel
if
he
think
its
needed
for
a
greater
good
.
that
just
perfectly
fits
the
personality
obi-wan
shows
in
the
older
movies
.
the
only
difference
is
that
the
old
obi-wan
is
not
a
rebel
in
any
way
since
there
is
no
jedi
order
.
c3po
just
a
clown
nothing
more
.
it
is
exactly
the
same
role
played
by
jar
jar
or
even
by
himself
on
the
i
ii
and
iii
.
amidala
very
serious
and
focused
person
.
she
can
endure
any
hardship
with
the
same
fearless
determination
.
she
appears
to
have
no
feelings
while
leading
her
planet
but
she
is
sweet
smart
and
corageus
when
she
is
not
in
the
rule
of
queen
os
senator
and
this
is
great
.
actually
i
cant
even
imagine
a
queen
being
any
other
way
.
what
should
she
be
sterical
and
stubborn
like
leia
her
image
is
the
same
as
angela
merkels
or
queen
elizabeths
.
also
does
everyone
in
your
world
must
have
a
non-regular
behaviour
somehow
maybe
you
dont
know
serious
people
but
they
do
exist
.
also
stop
asking
morons
what
they
think
about
the
sagas
ask
someone
that
at
least
understood
the
movies
.
lets
just
make
another
question
game
shall
we
describe
the
galaxy
in
the
2
trilogies
without
describing
specifically
any
planet
i
ii
and
iii
a
bible
of
content
.
iv
v
and
vi
nothing
wait
hoth
story
let
me
see
the
whole
galaxy
is
at
piece
and
you
want
a
pointless
action
scene
at
the
beginning
of
phantom
menace
how
ridiculous
is
that
you
want
action
at
the
beginning
watch
revenge
of
the
sith
and
fill
your
eyes
with
grandiosity
and
shame
for
ever
having
said
that
youve
seen
a
great
space
battle
before
.
asnwer
me
this
based
only
in
the
iv
v
and
vi
how
does
the
galaxy
work
what
does
a
jedi
do
the
answer
is
silence
because
there
is
nothing
about
the
rest
of
the
universe
in
the
older
trilogy
.
i
believe
you
thought
that
a
jedi
would
just
go
wherever
crime
is
and
destroy
everyone
like
a
super
hero
so
naive
if
youre
more
than
15yo
.
lucas
spent
some
time
showing
everyone
what
is
the
galaxy
and
what
a
jedi
do
and
all
you
can
do
is
complain
about
not
having
a
battle
go
watch
braddock
damn
it
the
i
ii
and
iii
are
so
full
of
iformation
because
the
have
to
set
their
own
background
and
the
background
of
the
older
trilogy
that
was
so
incomplete
.
the
older
trilogy
could
even
be
renamed
to
the
space
adventures
of
luke
skywalker
and
it
would
fit
because
there
is
nothing
else
to
the
movie
now
try
to
do
that
to
the
new
trilogy
you
cant
and
you
know
why
because
there
are
many
important
facts
and
characters
happening
everywhere
in
the
galaxy
covered
all
the
time
in
different
takes
.
the
movie
is
rich
.
the
real
star
wars
can
only
be
seen
in
the
i
ii
and
iii
because
the
old
movies
dont
have
a
galaxy
only
4
or
5
unexplored
planets
1
moon
and
some
teddy
bears
.
im
stopping
here
because
if
i
go
on
ill
find
much
more
flaws
on
your
review
much
more
than
i
thought
.
but
at
least
ill
just
explain
your
point
of
view
.
back
in
the
70s-80s
science
fiction
wasnt
so
explored
as
it
is
today
and
thats
a
great
part
of
the
success
of
a
new
hope
.
the
whole
movie
was
like
nothing
youve
ever
seen
before
.
the
feeling
that
you
must
have
felt
when
you
saw
it
on
the
theater
must
have
been
incredible
almost
impossible
to
describe
.
i
envy
you
for
ive
never
seen
those
movies
in
a
theather
since
i
was
born
in
1980
.
unfortunately
that
feeling
clouded
your
judgement
because
you
expected
the
same
feeling
in
the
new
saga
and
thats
impossible
because
science
fiction
and
aliens
are
just
a
very
commom
subject
today
.
also
you
have
the
oldmans
revolt
.
i
created
the
name
but
it
is
a
very
well
known
syndrome
where
old
people
desperately
try
to
enrich
their
youth
to
see
it
as
fasr
superior
to
todays
youth
even
young
people
that
hates
nowadays
life
style
can
have
that
syndrome
.
that
makes
you
love
every
single
piece
of
shit
from
the
past
even
flaws
and
mistakes
.
because
of
that
feeling
you
tend
to
say
that
everything
that
was
old
is
better
but
look
at
yourself
you
are
complaining
about
the
new
movies
because
a
queen
does
look
like
a
queen
and
a
jedi
master
does
look
like
a
jedi
master
.
or
even
because
you
are
being
filled
with
information
about
the
galaxy
politics
governments
species
knowledge
thats
just
absurd
.
you
praise
the
incomplete
and
despises
what
is
well
described
.
i
know
this
is
not
lucas
fault
.
he
already
said
that
he
didnt
have
the
money
or
tech
to
make
the
old
movies
as
wide
as
they
should
be
but
limitiations
are
to
be
just
respected
not
praised
so
i
tend
to
overlook
these
flaws
.
dont
get
me
wrong
im
really
confident
that
im
one
of
the
biggest
fans
star
wars
will
ever
have
but
even
so
its
hard
to
let
pass
things
like
lack
of
good
choreographers
this
was
responsible
by
horrible
fight
between
old
kenobi
and
vader
.
obi-wan
looked
like
an
old
man
using
a
cane
to
scare
off
a
dog
and
made
me
think
that
a
jedi
was
a
piece
of
shit
lightsaber
and
all
.
that
was
not
dramatic
but
a
shit
fight
.
also
han
shaking
his
blaster
while
shooting
is
pretty
ridiculous
looks
like
a
kid
saying
bang
characters
breathing
in
space
solo
and
crew
no
comments
lack
of
background
of
the
rest
of
the
galaxy
only
fucking
luke
ive
said
enough
about
this
already
.
ridiculous
outfits
specially
those
turtle
helmets
and
the
plastic
armor
of
the
storm
troopers
.
now
you
have
to
learn
that
what
is
old
is
not
necessarily
good
.
some
things
are
but
not
everything
.
also
all
the
old
saga
was
incomplete
and
full
of
flaws
due
to
lack
of
time
money
and
expertise
and
nothing
of
that
happenend
to
the
new
saga
made
as
lucas
intended
star
was
to
be
.
everything
on
the
new
movies
is
made
to
fix
the
old
olnes
and
make
everything
a
whole
with
sense
.
they
even
refused
to
use
cg
to
make
the
wookiees
just
to
avoid
creating
a
big
gap
between
them
and
that
poorly
made
chewbacca
costume
from
the
old
saga
.
if
something
is
wrong
is
in
the
old
movies
not
in
the
new
ones
.
stop
loving
crap
and
start
fundamenting
your
opinions
in
a
more
solid
way
aside
from
your
own
feelings
of
revolt
.
http
whos
the
bigger
nerd
the
nerd
that
complains
or
the
nerd
that
writes
a
mile
long
essay
about
those
complaints

cegolal
simpletons
please
keep
out
of
this
argument
.
go
watch
reality
shows
which
suits
more
your
level

that
probably
would
have
been
useful
to
mention
in
the
movie

mrmandude
my
star
wars
prequel
ideas
i
just
made
up
right
now
yoda
obi-wan
the
republic
stormtroopers
republic
army
and
the
rest
of
the
jedi
order
are
fighting
a
massive
galactic
war
with
a
separatist
army
thats
rumored
to
be
led
by
a
pair
of
sith
warriors
.
obi-wan
and
yoda
are
among
a
group
of
jedi
trying
to
find
more
leads
into
this
mystery
while
other
jedi
fight
the
separatist
group
.
they
chase
leads
on
dangerous
grimy
crime
separatist
controlled
planets
looking
for
leads
.
they
finally
find
the
sith
apprentice
and
a
part
of
the
separatist
army
on
an
urban
planet
.
obi-wan
and
yoda
try
to
kill
him
and
discover
that
the
apprentice
and
his
team
have
been
laying
the
groundwork
for
a
full
scale
invasion
.
yoda
and
obi-wan
have
to
get
off
the
planet
to
send
word
to
the
council
.
they
search
the
city
for
an
adequete
pilot
scince
they
dont
have
enough
credits
to
buy
a
new
ship
and
yoda
forbids
stealing
one
even
thogh
obi-wan
suggests
it
.
they
hear
about
a
great
pilot
known
as
anakin
.
they
find
anakin
whos
supprisingly
15-16
ish
.
anakin
is
street
smart
and
sly
as
well
as
arrogant
.
but
yoda
senses
an
extreme
potential
in
the
force
within
anakin
.
yoda
and
obi-wan
start
training
him
hoping
he
might
be
a
good
ally
.
they
have
to
convince
the
council
to
let
them
do
so
given
anakins
age
.
the
chancellor
refuses
to
send
support
to
the
system
but
is
assasinated
assasin
made
it
look
like
an
accident
.
palpatine
rises
to
power
and
decides
to
send
support
to
the
planet
hoping
to
gain
popularity
and
even
more
power
through
a
military
win
.
the
planet
is
liberated
from
the
separatists
but
the
sith
gets
away
.
anakin
has
not
reached
his
potential
but
he
adapted
to
the
force
very
rapidly
.
palpatine
aka
darth
sidious
has
a
few
conversations
with
his
apprentice
throughout
the
movie
.
this
explains
palpatines
goal
of
seizing
complete
control
of
the
republic
and
restoring
sith
dominance
in
the
galaxy
.
he
hopes
to
do
so
by
establishing
a
fake
separatistrebel
army
to
create
enough
tension
in
the
galaxy
to
expose
the
undecisive
democratic
senate
.
he
will
gain
his
power
this
way
until
he
has
the
reigns
.
while
the
participants
in
the
rebellion
beleive
it
to
be
a
true
revolution
they
dont
know
its
true
purpose
.
thats
the
end
of
number
one
.
mrmandude
numero
2
a
few
years
have
past
scince
obi-wan
and
yoda
met
anakin
.
yoda
is
nearly
fully
devoted
to
his
time
on
the
council
and
cant
go
on
so
many
missions
anymore
.
anakin
is
now
pretty
expirienced
and
obi-wan
is
no
longer
a
padawan
and
hasnt
been
scince
anakin
officialy
joined
the
jedi
.
yoda
used
to
be
more
actively
involved
in
training
anakin
but
because
of
anakins
quick
ascent
through
force
skills
and
yodas
increasing
council
duties
not
much
is
left
to
teach
.
anakin
and
obi-wan
work
together
very
often
along
with
jedi
ky
muul
and
anya
firdassa
i
made
them
up

muul
is
a
stoic
and
honorable
green
nautolan
jedi
master

hes
strong
and
weilds
a
double
bladed
blue
lightsaber
.
anya
is
a
young
energetic
tough
and
spunky
jedi
knight
.
shes
agile
and
weilds
two
green
lightsabers
.
she
is
a
tan
human
.
the
team
of
four
is
sent
to
naboo
to
finish
joining
naboo
to
the
republics
side
in
the
war
.
when
they
get
there
theyre
introduced
to
padme
amidala
the
queen
of
naboo
.
anakin
and
padme
meet
after
a
round
of
dealings
and
begin
a
secret
relationship
.
anakin
and
the
other
jedi
need
to
secure
naboos
loyalty
by
promising
protection
.
padme
becomes
the
new
senator
giving
up
the
throne
to
serve
in
the
galactic
senate
.
meanwhile
the
team
of
jedi
is
sent
to
track
down
a
lead
on
the
most
powerful
information
broker
in
the
galaxy
.
the
broker
has
acquired
sensitive
information
that
could
cause
a
war
between
naboo
and
another
system
.
the
jedi
also
find
this
mission
to
their
advantage
the
broker
having
possible
knowlege
on
the
separatists
.
they
eventually
find
the
location
of
the
brokers
base
a
massive
space
station
.
when
they
get
there
they
reallize
that
the
separatists
too
are
onboard
the
station
and
have
already
begun
their
assault

in

if

had
thought
of
that
they
wouldnt
have
had
to
spend
so
much
time
being
shot
at

the

basically
they
unneccesarily
sent

beavobeave
hey
pause
part
2
of
this
review
at
2309..
does
anyone
notice
anything
weird
about
the
angle
of
the
street
with
the
window
they
are
looking
out
of
its
like
the
building
theyre
in
hangs
over
the
street
.
http
wow
thats
almost
like
what
actually
happened
.
you
no
doubt
have
the
gift
of
delusions
of
grandeur
.
get
a
grip
jackass
.
someone
but
i
can
describe
the
obi-wan
and
qui-gon
of
the
prequels
.
see
obi-wan
is
a
man
who
genuinely
loves
his
teacher
and
wants
to
do
the
right
thing
.
he
tries
to
help
people
whenever
he
can
but
hes
young
so
he
can
be
rash
.
he
goes
through
a
tremendous
character
arc
growing
up
after
the
death
of
his
father
figure
and
raising
a
child
who
eventually
turns
against
him
.
qui-gon
loves
his
student
more
deeply
than
really
he
should
.
he
was
mentored
by
someone
who
eventually
became
what
he
considered
evil
and
was
thus
much
more
sympathetic
to
that
sort
of
evil
person
making
obi-wan
likewise
sympathetic
.
he
cared
more
about
people
than
politics
and
tried
to
help
people
whenever
he
could
though
he
retained
too
much
respect
for
those
who
had
taught
him
to
disobey
them
in
a
major
way
.
momrocker
i
laughed
at
all
the
people
who
didnt
get
the
joke
.
marvin
falz
im
a
person
and
my
name
is
anakin
something
in
me
died
when
i
heard
this
line
the
first
time
.
its
time
to
kill
the
jedi
oh
good
always
makes
me
laugh
.
deerstop
the
whole
quite
rebellion
is
not
exactly
a
very
good
idea
because
being
different
is
permitted
to
some
point
.
its
never
said
in
the
movies
but
as
i
vaguely
remember
from
the
books
qui
gon
jinn
was
a
bit
of
rebel
himself
and
often
disagreed
with
jedi
council
.
in
fact
thats
why
he
wore
a
long
hair
which
supposedly
is
prohibited
by
the
jedi
code
or
something
.
http
are
you
fucking
serius

there
wasnt
a
joke.i
wonder
what
you
think

laughing
at
anonymous
the
cuban

called

i

if
you
like
these

you
will
really
like

http
youngkob
what
i
dont
get
is
how
anakin
is
the
most
powerful
jedi
but
he
is
not
as
powerful
as
the
emperor
or
starkiller
.
its
like
hes
a
basic
sith
.
youngkob
if
jedi
arent
allowed
to
love

how
do
they

more
specifically
simon
made

this
review
in
their
latest
video

http
http
i
hate
to
come
out
the
gate
here
being
full
of
vitriol
but
after
watching
the
funny
and
brilliant
review
for
tpm
and
then
afterwards
reading
some
of
the
comments
on
here
about
the
review
itself
i
have
to
say
that
so
many
of
you
miss
the
point
of
something
like
this
.
obviously
redlettermedia
uses
comedic
themes
to
create
a
premise
and
that
premise
runs
through
all
of
their
material
especially
hitb
and
gamestation
2.0
.
in
these
reviews
mr.
plinkett
is
executing
a
style
of
humor
called
satire
.
in
fact
one
might
even
call
it
sardonic
or
cynical
or
drydark
humor
.
the
intention
of
this
review
and
a
lot
of
other
plinkett
reviews
is
to
insist
upon
the
fact
that
something
as
silly
as
a
star
wars
prequel
is
completely
overtaking
his
mind
and
he
is
driving
himself
crazy
to
the
point
of
obsession
and
rumination
over
the
smallest
details
of
the
movie
.
imo
theres
a
meta-joke
hidden
in
the
character
of
mr.
plinkett
mr.
plinketts
literally
murderous
and
defensive
standpoint
on
his
own
opinion
is
ironically
a
lot
like
a
stereotypical
internet
commentators
might
be
.
with
that
in
mind
the
reason
why
this
review
ends
up
being
brilliant
is
because
the
cynical
tone
of
the
review
unintentionally
points
out
a
great
deal
of
plot
holes
technical
errors
and
bad
scriptwriting
that
is
present
in
the
movie
.
i
can
say
that
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
star
wars
especially
the
ot
so
im
biased
as
well
.
furthermore
its
implied
that
mike
s.
mr.
plinkett
is
a
fan
of
the
previous
movies
because
someone
who
hasnt
seen
the
ot
or
who
didnt
appreciateworship
it
wouldnt
dedicate
so
much
time
to
pointing
out
the
inadequacies
in
the
continuation
of
such
a
beloved
and
hallowed
series
of
films
.
if
you
ask
me
i
personally
thought
tpm
was
boring
.
to
me
the
only
cool
and
interesting
part
of
tpm
was
the
lightsaber
duel
between
qui-gon
obi-wan
and
darth
maul
and
thats
only
because
i
liked
the
lightsaber
fight
scenes
in
empire
and
jedi
so
much
.
im
biased
yet
we
are
all
biased
with
us
being
the
imperfect
irrational
carbon-based
heliotropes
that
we
are
.
this
brings
me
back
to
my
original
point
these
reviews
are
made
for
fun
and
entertainment
.
rlm
never
takes
themselves
too
seriously
and
thats
probably
why
theyve
garnered
so
many
fans
.
its
funny
because
its
absurd
that
is
the
entire
point
of
comedy
.
it
seems
almost
impalpable
that
so
many
people
choose
to
nitpick
a
cheeky
silly
interpretation
of
a
terrible
movie
from
their
own
perspective
all
while
taking
themselves
too
seriously
.
this
armchair
critic
bullshit
is
like
asking
for
a
gold
star
from
the
denizens
of
the
internet
.
so
whats
next
a
review
of
the
review
of
tpm
or
a
review
of
the
review
of
the
review
of
tpm
gim
me
a
fucking
break
.
i
have
a
feeling
that
the
naysayers
on
this
site
and
on
the
internet
in
general
are
just
simple
contrary
assholes
with
nothing
better
to
do
than
to
rip
on
someone
whos
doing
something
funny
and
original
.
redlettermedia
makes
hilariously
satrical
low-budget-yet-well-conceived
internet
videos
for
people
and
ask
for
very
little
in
return
.
that
to
me
is
a
lost
art
.
the
art
of
subtlety
.
it
seems
a
lot
of
you
could
use
a
little
.
http
the
pizza
roll
scene
is
genuinely
creepy
http
its
strange
because
even
as
a
kid
the
prequels
still
bored
me
to
death
because
space
politics
.
http
seems
like
ur
nitpicking
.
i
really
like
you
fanboys
ur
never
happy
.
honestly
idk
why
ur
bitching
.
i
liked
it
a
lot
.
in
fact
its
better
than
the
first
3
.
adl
is
it
bad
that
ive
watched
these
reviews
like
5
times
but
i
still
find
myself
coming
back
to
watch
them
again

jim
campbell
if
the
reviewer
were
nerdy
or
a
voice
of
authority
that
implies
that
special
knowledge
or
expertise
was
necessary
to
make
those
judgments
.
the
plinkett
character
is
an
effective
device
that
tells
the
viewer
even
an
ignorant
psychopath
can
see
whats
wrong
with
this
.
it
also
helps
the
writer
behind
the
character
to
go
over
the
top
andor
meaner
with
his
criticism
.
aimed
at
a
deserving
target
and
used
intelligently
that
also
seems
to
work
out
well
.

part
about

was
dumb

it
wasnt

complicated

well
if
you
accept
that

only
fell
because
he
saw
no
way
to
save
the
woman
he
loves

its
possible
his
nature
was
always
more
good
than
evil

limiting
his
darkside

the

sucked

dunag
he
was

http
to
be
charitable
to
lucas
your
interest
in
the
wider
universe
sounds
like
what
ive
always
assumed
about
the
guy
â
he
was
fascinated
by
the
big
picture
in
his
head
.
the
first
problem
is
either
you
make
a
fictional
almanac
or
you
make
a
work
of
drama
.
even
if
lucas
writing
were
competent
plots
are
all
about
human
interest
and
pacing
â
if
you
set
out
to
tell
a
story
the
audience
is
going
to
expect
a
story
not
a
recitation
of
indices
.
the
second
problem
is
that
lucas
understanding
of
his
world
is
and
was
always
nebulous
â
the
prequels
feel
like
recycled
fan-fic
because
it
was
creative
people
around
him
who
brought
the
original
star
wars
movies
to
life
by
introducing
their
own
interpretations
suggestions
and
challenges
.
lucas
was
the
spark
sure
but
his
one-man
show
proved
he
was
nothing
more
.
storyguy
i
have
read
some
of
suggestions
for
a
different
version
of
star
wars
prequels
.
well
here
is
my
suggestion
.
after
the
title
crawl
an
organian
ship
bursts
onto
the
screens
as
it
drops
out
of
hyper-space
.
immediately
you
can
tell
that
the
ship
is
in
distress
as
the
lights
and
power
flicker
on
the
ship
and
it
is
trailing
smoke
.
the
two
man
cockpit
shows
to
pilots
one
is
franticly
pulling
up
star
charts
while
the
other
hitting
buttoms
to
keep
the
ship
operational
and
asking
where
did
we
end
up
.
the
other
explains
were
about
25
parsecs
from
our
distinition
.
were
not
going
to
making
it
are
we
.
the
other
explains
without
hyper
drive
were
not
going
anywhere
.
find
us
a
place
to
put
down
quick
theyre
right
on
our
tail
.
then
the
one
looking
at
the
star
maps
points
to
a
planet
.
the
ship
cruises
toward
the
planet
.
suddeningly
another
ship
drops
out
of
hyperspace
.
its
roughly
the
same
size
but
with
different
marking
and
configuration
.
the
crippled
ship
enters
the
atmosphere
of
a
desolate
desert
planet
tattooine
.
the
ship
crashes
just
outside
a
city
.
the
pilots
abandon
the
ship
grabbing
a
damaged
and
inoperable
asto-mech
droid
as
they
escape
to
smoldering
wreckage
.
they
carry
the
droid
on
a
gaurney
as
they
head
toward
the
city
in
the
distance
.
the
two
men
try
to
find
an
in
where
they
can
hide
and
none
of
the
locals
will
say
anything
.
once
they
secure
a
place
to
hide
they
look
for
a
repair
shop
to
get
the
droid
fixed
.
meanwhile
the
persuing
ship
lands
near
the
wreckage
of
the
first
.
two
men
in
long
robes
exit
the
ship
and
begin
investigating
the
wreckage
.
jawas
and
local
people
are
scavengering
about
the
ship
.
the
two
hooded
men
are
a
young
obiwan
and
mace
windu
.
thats
just
a
start
.
essentially
the
plot
would
be
that
the
pilots
of
the
organa
ship
are
sabotuers
.
the
damages
droid
is
r2-d2
.
one
of
the
men
knows
the
ways
of
the
force
.
obiwan
and
mace
chase
the
men
down
and
catch
up
to
them
after
a
long
foot
chase
through
the
crowded
city
with
the
sabotuers
shooting
at
them
and
the
jedi
deflecting
them
while
trying
to
protect
civilians
.
no
stupid
super
speed
running
they
corner
the
vilians
were
one
pulls
out
a
lightsaber
and
they
duel
.
but
civilians
get
in
the
way
and
the
sith
endangers
them
just
at
that
moment
a
young
man
a
street
performer
intercedes
because
his
mother
and
grand-mother
are
under
threat
.
he
uses
great
acrobatic
skills
and
defeats
the
sith
.
the
jedi
are
amazed
the
force
is
strong
with
him
this
simple
street
performer
from
poor
means
a
begger
using
his
great
powers
and
skill
to
support
his
family
his
mother
and
grandmother
.
he
is
anikin
skywalker
.
no
stupid
little
kid
anakin
knows
about
the
force
but
his
family
was
always
too
poor
to
do
anything
about
it
.
but
anakin
is
confused
by
the
evil
force
user
the
sith
.
mace
explains
that
long
ago
before
men
ever
counted
the
days
.
there
were
2
kinds
of
people
force
users
and
regular
people
.
some
force
users
were
kind
and
generous
and
others
were
selfish
.
but
they
all
used
the
force
for
personal
gains
.
later
as
societies
grew
force
users
were
made
into
kings
.
some
kings
were
just
others
were
corrupt
.
finally
some
forcer
users
studied
the
force
deeply
and
became
priests
.
they
realized
that
the
force
was
in
all
things
and
was
meant
to
be
user
for
the
good
of
all
people
collectively
.
but
others
disagreed
they
felt
what
was
the
use
of
having
these
powers
if
they
couldnt
use
them
to
benefit
their
own
tribe
or
kingdom
or
family
.
there
was
a
great
divide
and
the
priests
became
known
as
jedi
and
others
became
sith
.
obiwan
is
confused
because
their
should
be
no
more
sith
.
anakin
joins
the
jedis
as
they
travel
to
corrisant
to
report
their
finding
and
recover
what
r2
was
carrying
.
the
information
he
was
carrying
was
from
queen
amadala
.
it
was
the
notification
of
a
plot
on
the
part
of
a
group
of
star
systems
to
susseed
from
the
republic
and
form
a
separatist
group
.
why
because
of
their
lack
of
representation
in
the
senate
.
these
star
systems
are
all
corporate
and
industrial
manufacturing
planets
.
planets
of
commerce
and
wealth
.
they
want
majority
representation
but
the
republic
holds
to
equal
representation
.
the
seperatists
want
majority
rule
inorder
to
set
policies
in
their
favor
.
to
drive
down
wages
and
increase
their
assets
.
the
separatists
are
pressuring
her
star
system
of
organa
not
naboo
no
jar
jar
to
join
their
group
or
else
theyll
sanction
here
planet
and
shoot
down
any
ship
that
leave
the
system
.
the
jedi
were
to
rendezvous
with
the
organain
ship
in
secret
but
it
was
taken
over
by
separatists
as
the
pilots
were
taking
the
info
to
their
leaders
of
proof
that
amadala
had
sold
them
out
.
luckily
they
intercepted
the
ship
and
with
anakins
help
they
had
stopped
the
bad
guys
from
exposing
amadala
testamony
about
the
separatists
.
anakin
explains
that
being
from
an
outlaying
planet
these
corporate
planets
use
tattoonie
for
labor
and
pay
them
nothing
.
these
separatist
want
to
exploit
other
star
systems
the
same
way
.
they
induct
anakin
into
the
jedi
order
and
obiwan
is
to
begin
training
him
.
no
prophecy
yoda
is
proud
of
obiwans
progress
.
obi
is
yodas
student
.
they
all
go
organa
to
free
the
queen
and
here
people
from
the
separatists
pressure
and
assault
.
they
go
free
the
people
and
the
queen
and
find
that
sith
influence
is
involved
with
the
separatists
.
nice
big
battle
no
goofy
gungans
anakin
personally
rescues
amadala
and
immediately
he
puts
the
moves
on
her
and
she
likes
him
too
.
they
share
a
kiss
.
the
jedi
are
not
forbidding
to
love
or
marry
but
if
they
do
marry
they
are
not
allowed
to
have
advanced
training
.
that
would
conflict
with
their
devotions
.
you
can
not
serve
2
masters
.
in
part
2
you
could
have
obi
trying
to
pressure
anakin
to
not
take
his
relationship
with
amadala
too
seriously
but
anakin
has
skill
and
powers
and
potiential
to
get
a
great
jedi
master
.
obi
insists
that
because
anakin
is
so
strong
with
the
force
he
owns
it
to
himself
to
reach
his
fullest
potiential
.
but
anakin
is
alreeady
falling
for
padame
and
she
for
him
.
dont
have
anakin
be
a
bad
apple
from
the
start
.
he
should
be
idealistic
and
smooth
and
very
likable
with
the
ladies
.

in
the
distance
.
the
two
men
try
to
find
an
in
where
they
can
hide
and
none
of
the
locals
will
say
anything
.
once
they
secure
a
place
to
hide
they
look
for
a
repair
shop
to
get
the
droid
fixed
.
meanwhile
the
pursuing
ship
lands
near
the
wreckage
of
the
first
.
two
men
in
long
robes
exit
the
ship
and
begin
investigating
the
wreckage
.
jawas
and
local
people
scavenge
about
the
ship
.
the
two
hooded
men
are
a
young
obiwan
and
mace
windu
maybe
qui-gan
.
thats
just
a
start
.
essentially
the
plot
would
be
that
the
pilots
of
the
organa
ship
are
sabotuers
.
the
damages
droid
is
r2-d2
.
one
of
the
men
knows
the
ways
of
the
force
.
obiwan
and
mace
chase
the
men
down
and
catch
up
to
them
after
a
long
foot
chase
through
the
crowded
city
with
the
sabotuers
shooting
at
them
and
the
jedi
deflecting
them
while
trying
to
protect
civilians
.
no
stupid
super
speed
running
they
corner
the
vilians
were
one
pulls
out
a
lightsaber
and
they
duel
.
but
civilians
get
in
the
way
and
the
sith
endangers
them
just
at
that
moment
a
young
man
a
street
performer
intercedes
because
his
mother
and
grand-mother
are
under
threat
.
he
uses
great
acrobatic
skills
and
defeats
the
sith
.
the
jedi
are
amazed
the
force
is
strong
with
him
this
simple
street
performer
from
poor
means
a
begger
using
his
great
powers
and
skill
to
support
his
family
his
mother
and
grandmother
.
he
is
anikin
skywalker
.
no
stupid
little
kid
anakin
knows
about
the
force
but
his
family
was
always
too
poor
to
do
anything
about
it
.
but
anakin
is
confused
by
the
evil
force
user
the
sith
.
mace
explains
that
long
ago
before
men
ever
counted
the
days
.
there
were
2
kinds
of
people
force
users
and
regular
people
.
some
force
users
were
kind
and
generous
and
others
were
selfish
.
but
they
all
used
the
force
for
personal
gains
.
later
as
societies
grew
force
users
were
made
into
kings
.
some
kings
were
just
others
were
corrupt
.
finally
some
forcer
users
studied
the
force
deeply
and
became
priests
.
they
realized
that
the
force
was
in
all
things
and
was
meant
to
be
user
for
the
good
of
all
people
collectively
.
but
others
disagreed
they
felt
what
was
the
use
of
having
these
powers
if
they
couldnt
use
them
to
benefit
their
own
tribe
or
kingdom
or
family
.
there
was
a
great
divide
and
the
priests
became
known
as
jedi
and
others
became
sith
.
obiwan
is
confused
because
there
should
be
no
more
sith
.
anakin
joins
the
jedis
as
they
travel
to
corrisant
to
report
their
finding
and
recover
what
r2
was
carrying
.
the
information
he
was
carrying
was
from
queen
amadala
.
it
was
the
notification
of
a
plot
on
the
part
of
a
group
of
star
systems
to
succeed
from
the
republic
and
form
a
separatist
group
.
why
because
of
their
lack
of
representation
in
the
senate
.
these
star
systems
are
all
corporate
and
industrial
manufacturing
planets
.
planets
of
commerce
and
wealth
.
they
want
majority
representation
but
the
republic
holds
to
equal
representation
.
the
seperatists
want
majority
rule
in
order
to
set
policies
in
their
favor
to
drive
down
wages
and
increase
their
assets
.
the
separatists
are
pressuring
her
star
system
of
organa
not
naboo
no
jar
jar
to
join
their
group
because
they
are
a
critical
industrial
system
theyâre
using
old
gangster
tactics
or
pressure
and
intimidation
.
no
occupying
forces
just
lobbyists
and
ambassadors
of
the
planetâs
they
represent
following
her
around
and
constantly
approaching
her
when
she
is
talking
to
other
representatives
to
eaves
drop
on
their
conversation
.
they
keep
trying
to
reason
with
her
to
support
them
and
that
they
have
the
right
to
form
their
own
coalition
.
the
jedi
were
to
rendezvous
with
the
organain
ship
in
secret
but
it
was
taken
over
by
separatists
as
the
pilots
were
taking
the
info
to
their
leaders
as
proof
that
amadala
had
sold
them
out
.
luckily
they
intercepted
the
ship
and
with
anakins
help
they
had
stopped
the
bad
guys
from
exposing
amadala
testamony
about
the
separatists
to
the
separatists
.
anakin
explains
that
being
from
an
outlaying
planet
these
corporate
planets
use
tattoonie
for
labor
and
pay
them
nothing
.
these
separatist
want
to
exploit
other
star
systems
the
same
way
.
no
boring
senate
meeting
they
induct
anakin
into
the
jedi
order
and
obiwan
is
to
begin
training
him
.
no
prophecy
yoda
is
proud
of
obiwans
progress
.
obi
is
yodas
student
.
they
all
go
organa
obiwan
mace
maybe
qui-gan
anakin
and
r2
to
support
the
queen
and
her
people
from
the
separatists
pressure
and
assault
.
they
sneak
in
to
speak
to
the
queen
and
find
that
sith
influence
is
involved
with
the
separatists
.
then
when
they
confront
to
separatists
they
find
that
they
have
a
small
detachment
of
about
20
cloned
human
soldiers
with
them
.
nice
lazer
verses
saber
battle
no
goofy
gungans
anakin
personally
rescues
amadala
from
the
fighting
and
immediately
he
puts
the
moves
on
her
and
she
likes
him
too
.
they
share
a
kiss
.
the
jedi
are
not
forbidding
to
love
or
marry
but
if
they
do
marry
they
are
not
allowed
to
have
advanced
training
.
that
would
conflict
with
their
devotions
.
you
can
not
serve
2
masters
.
in
part
2
you
could
have
obi
trying
to
pressure
anakin
to
not
take
his
relationship
with
amadala
too
seriously
but
anakin
has
skill
and
powers
and
potiential
to
get
a
great
jedi
master
.
obi
insists
that
because
anakin
is
so
strong
with
the
force
he
owns
it
to
himself
to
reach
his
fullest
potiential
.
but
anakin
is
already
falling
for
padame
and
she
with
him
.
dont
have
anakin
be
a
bad
apple
from
the
start
.
he
should
be
idealistic
and
smooth
and
very
likable
with
the
ladies
.
anyway
as
anakin
leads
padame
away
from
the
fighting
they
get
confronted
by
another
sith
.
anakin
has
no
light-saber
.
but
must
use
his
skill
to
fight
the
sith
.
obiwan
sees
anakin
fighting
then
joins
him
in
fighting
the
sith
.
anakin
distracts
him
while
obiwan
fight
shim
.
mace
and
qui-gan
run
to
join
but
are
detained
by
the
soldiers
.
the
sith
is
almost
cornered
and
disarmed
when
he
take
anakin
hostage
.
just
as
anakin
escapes
the
sith
is
able
to
kill
qui-gan
.
then
before
being
disarmed
by
obiwan
mace
and
anakin
who
takes
up
qui-ganâs
saber
the
sith
commits
suicide
.
at
the
end
organa
is
placed
under
the
exclusive
protection
of
the
republicâs
space
flight
guard
to
prevent
any
retaliation
by
the
separatists
.
the
republic
and
the
jedi
are
worried
about
the
proliferation
of
sith
knights
and
the
evidence
that
the
separatists
have
clone
soldiers
already
and
maybe
planning
to
move
against
the
republic
if
they
have
enough
clone
soldiers
.
part
2
should
open
with
the
separatistâs
first
all
out
attack
on
outlaying
star
systems
and
occupying
them
as
they
push
their
way
towards
the
core
systems
.
this
attack
comes
just
a
month
before
the
supreme
chancellorâs
re-election
.
the
chancellor
declares
a
state
of
emergency
and
deploys
republic
forces
to
try
to
retake
the
occupied
systems
.
one
of
the
occupied
systems
is
tattoonie
.
anakin
has
been
sending
his
stipends
and
allowance
to
support
the
family
during
his
early
jedi
training
.
palpatine
senator
of
organa
runs
for
office
and
criticizes
the
chancellor
for
not
acting
sooner
to
reconcile
the
separatists
or
deal
with
them
before
this
heinous
attack
.
he
claims
that
the
chancellors
inaction
has
led
them
to
war
.
the
chancellor
argues
that
there
may
still
be
time
to
negotiate
with
the
separatists
that
we
need
not
go
to
war
.
but
palpatine
argues
that
we
are
in
a
state
of
war
and
that
we
must
act
now
to
crush
the
separatist
movement
before
it
destroys
the
republic
.
had
the
chancellor
done
so
earlier
this
war
would
not
have
engulfed
the
republic
.
the
chancellor
disputes
that
has
he
acted
that
way
earlier
we
would
have
been
plunged
into
war
sooner
.
war
would
not
have
been
averted
.
he
argues
that
palpatine
is
war
mongering
.
plapatine
claims
that
chancellor
is
the
war
monger
for
threatening
the
separatists
instead
of
reconciling
them
.
which
is
what
the
chancellor
has
been
doing
palpatine
is
using
double
speak
and
has
been
inciting
the
separatists
not
to
reconcile
with
the
republic
and
holding
off
an
attack
until
election
time
was
close
.
meanwhile
anakin
is
having
meditation
lessons
with
obiwan
.
obiwan
explains
that
when
the
force
is
in
harmony
it
flows
like
a
river
seeping
into
every
corner
of
existence
.
filling
all
living
things
up
and
where
ever
the
force
flows
life
grows
.
obi
tells
anakin
the
force
is
strong
with
him
because
of
where
he
is
from
.
a
place
that
was
weak
a
place
missing
life
.
so
the
force
flowed
into
him
to
make
life
flourish
in
the
desert
.
the
force
knows
where
it
is
needed
.
but
yodi
interrupts
and
tells
obi
that
something
is
interrupting
the
flow
of
the
force
.
obi
agrees
they
can
all
feel
a
disturbance
in
the
force
.
something
like
a
great
stone
is
scattering
the
flow
of
the
force
.
the
force
can
not
flow
freely
where
it
is
needed
most
.
the
strength
of
anakinâs
force
makes
him
a
good
candidate
to
restore
the
balance
of
the
force
.
it
seems
the
force
chose
him
for
this
.
but
anakin
is
distracted
his
mind
is
on
padame
and
he
worries
about
his
mother
under
separatist
occupation
.
http
in
theory
thats
a
possibility
but
watching
episodes
2
and
3
do
you
actually
get
even
the
tiniest
inkling
that
his
nature
was
ever
more
good
than
evil
.
i
remember
even
shortly
after
watching
attack
of
the
clones
and
i
actually
liked
the
prequels
when
i
was
younger
my
thoughts
were
huh
i
didnt
think
he
was
supposed
to
fall
to
the
dark
side
until
next
movie
.
ari
asulin
your
star
trek
review
where
you
went
to
great
lengths
to
defend
that
fad
hacker
abrams
was
most
disappoint
.
i
am
boycotting
all
future
reviews
by
you
of
that
particular
movie
.
sorry
.
learn
your
lesson
.
coolclouds
the
actors
were
not
the
problem
.
they
did
what
they
could
with
what
little
they
had
.
also
your
assessment
that
a
storys
basic
outline
is
generic
is
meaningless
.
at
this
point
every
story
is
essentially
generic
at
its
core
.
the
uniqueness
doesnt
come
from
the
basic
outline
.
it
comes
from
maybe
the
setting
the
dialogue
or
the
characters
themselves
.
there
are
no
new
stories
anymore
and
there
never
will
be
.
all
thats
left
is
stories
with
the
same
basic
premises
with
an
interesting
twist
in
one
of
the
things
i
mentioned
.
http
its
because
lucas
dont
think
of
the
star
wars
universe
like
we
do
.
we
perceived
it
mostly
trough
games
comic
books
and
the
new
movies
where
the
forcetraining
level
of
the
characters
matter
.
but
in
reality
in
the
original
trilogy
your
power
level
didnt
matter
so
much
as
the
motivation
for
your
character
.
thats
why
they
send
a
vulnerable
princess
in
disguise
to
jabas
lair
first
instead
of
sending
the
jedi
knight
to
fuck
everyone
up
and
steal
solos
tablet
.
i
think
the
new
movies
should
be
directed
at
the
new
audience
because
the
old
themes
from
the
original
trilogy
would
certainly
alienate
us
more
logic
and
action-craving
people
and
the
usual
moviegoing
nowadays
audience
.
it
would
be
a
sure
hit
.
i
hope
j.j.
abrahams
does
something
like
that
but
with
great
streamlined
character
development
and
emotion
his
work
is
known
for
.
canrespub
is
it
just
me
or
did
george
lucas
forget
that
the
imperial
senate
supported
the
rebellion
it
sounded
like
the
empire
was
established
through
a
military
or
fascist
coup
something
that
lucas
shouldve
focussed
on
in
the
prequels
.
http
lmao
matt
thats
great
that
you
feel
that
way
.
but
youre
wrong
and
this
movie
sucked
.
i
cant
comprehend
how
stupid
you
are
if
you
just
watched
this
review
and
didnt
believe
it
.
the
basterd
anybody
who
actually
liked
these
films
comes
from
what
i
like
to
call
the
instant
gratification
generation
its
a
generation
that
dislikes
things
like
plot
exposition
story
development
protagonists
antagonists
plot.these
things
mean
shit
to
this
generation
because
its
too
intangible
they
want
explosions
and
sparkling
vampires
and
shitty
sci
fi
revamps
that
dont
hold
a
candle
to
the
originals
because
if
they
did
then
this
generation
would
find
that
shit
boring
as
well
john
ha
damn
man
.
100
spot
on
obliteration
of
this
terrible
shit
movie
.
http
good
point
but
none
of
the
jedi
really
act
like
they
should
in
the
prequels
so
lets
just
say
its
bad
writing
and
be
done
with
it
http
no
its
not
.
eddyk
nobody
cares
.
the
pizza
roll
plinkett
you
bastard
you
will
deliver
me
my
fellow
brethren
or
there
will
be
hell
to
pay
i
shall
force
you
to
watch
the
star
wars
christmas
special
if
you
refuse
elliot
its
explained
in
the
attack
of
the
clones
whenever
dooku
captures
obi-wan
.
thats
one
thing
about
the
prequels
.
they
really
require
that
you
watch
all
3
for
them
to
make
sense
and
it
can
be
difficult
to
catch
everything
.
elliot
1
.
i
agree
the
prequels
are
better
in
the
fact
that
they
explain
star
wars
on
a
galactic
level
as
opposed
to
focusing
on
just
a
few
characters
.
everything
makes
more
sense
with
the
addition
of
the
prequel
trilogy
and
it
adds
replay
value
to
the
old
trilogy
because
you
now
have
an
understanding
of
vader
and
why
he
does
what
he
does
.
i
personally
like
both
trilogies
each
for
their
own
reason
.
william
shakesman
i
think
youve
got
it
completely
backwards
.
the
review
takes
itself
extremely
seriously
but
inserts
comedy
constantly
to
make
it
seem
like
it
doesnt
.
the
comedy
keeps
you
engaged
while
the
points
are
hammered
home
.
you
may
not
have
noticed
but
your
brain
did
.
qui
gon
booze
even
if
true
qui
gon
died
before
dooku
became
evil
and
never
knew
.
even
then
the
other
jedi
didnt
even
know
they
just
considered
him
a
political
idealist
.
so
if
you
truly
think
that
was
part
of
qui
gons
character
then
youve
been
punked
.
qui
gon
booze
i
always
assumed
they
had
to
go
down
the
trench
because
there
were
too
many
defense
turrets
along
the
surface
to
approach
from
that
direction
.
oddly
enough
there
were
even
turrets
in
the
trench
.
nope
ewan
mcgregor
is
the
main
character
as
obi-wan
kenobi
.
i
am
confused
as
to
what
your
character
point
is
.
http
tldr
you
should
open
a
dictionary
and
look
up
the
definition
of
the
word
irony
.
http
facepalm
nopantsbaby
hes
the
main
character
on
paper
but
he
is
not
integral
to
anything
that
actually
happens
.
you
could
replace
him
with
any
jedi
if
it
wasnt
for
the
3
originals
.
most
of
his
scenes
are
also
not
to
progress
the
plot
but
to
whine
and
bitch
.
http
sometimes
theyll
even
get
the
girl
in
the
end
as
icing
on
the
cake
willie
wonka
in
the
corner
just
made
me
cry
laughing
pure
genius

kevin
catlin
why
did
you
post
a
complaint
of
a
star
trek
review
on
a
review
of
the
phantom
menace
also
you
left
the
ing
off
of
the
end
of
disappoint
.
that
makes
you
look
like
a
retard
.
sorry
.
learn
your
lesson
.
kevin
catlin
its
a
called
a
joke
dipshit
.
sektor
i
watch
this
every
few
months
it
is
pure
gold
.
http
the
90
second
non
advertising
thing
is
bullshit
.
this
was
my
first
visit
to
the
site
and
if
you
want
to
prove
it
is
run
by
douche
bags
.
well
then
well
done
.
oh
yeah
.
wont
be
back
of
course
.
polarman
drop
the
ads
damnit
.
i
mean
im
still
going
to
watch
but
its
annoying
as
shit
hix
if
you
guys
the
complaining
viewers
dont
understand
why
there
are
ads
before
or
during
the
things
you
want
to
watch
then
you
probably
dont
understand
how
things
work
like
at
all
.
you
see
rlm
has
to
pay
for
webspace
and
junk
in
order
to
host
videos
and
whatever
.
they
dont
have
like
some
kinda
server
farm
and
a
satellite
in
orbit
.
and
since
they
know
you
probably
dont
want
to
pay
cash
every
time
you
want
to
watch
a
video
then
they
make
you
pay
the
only
other
way
possible
with
thirty
seconds
of
your
time
time
you
can
spend
not
paying
attention
to
the
ad
anyways
.
you
see
companies
pay
just
have
the
chance
to
get
your
attention
.
nave
oh
oh..oh
.
patrick
yeah
i
just
installed
adblock
a
week
or
so
ago
because
i
felt
like
i
was
going
to
kill
myself
if
i
had
to
watch
another
30
second
ad
for
a
000016
second
video
on
youtube
but
im
going
to
disable
it
for
rlms
website
since
they
actually
do
deserve
it
.
http
i
love
every
mr
plinkett
review
.
perceptive
fun
and
witty
.
helps
me
understand
why
i
despise
this
crap
http
youre
either
a
troll
or
too
young
to
give
a
shit
about
the
importance
of
character
development
and
a
solid
story
.
this
movie
had
neither
of
those
going
for
it
.
please
go
back
to
school
and
hopefully
youll
accidentally
learn
something
.
http
sorry
but
youre
wrong
.
this
review
summed
things
up
from
how
a
film
should
be
made
.
your
first
line
to
defend
this
film
against
this
review
was
the
audience
needs
a
protagonist
who
the
hell
told
you
that
i
stopped
reading
there
because
you
obviously
have
no
fucking
idea
what
youre
talking
about
.
almost
every
engaging
movie
has
a
central
character
we
know
more
about
than
the
other
characters
in
the
film
.
this
review
explains
this
.
it
spends
5
to
10
minutes
establishing
this
point
.
are
you
mental
stop
using
synonyms
and
spell
check
to
sound
smarter
than
you
actually
are
.
it
doesnt
help
the
fact
that
you
are
calling
everybody
here
nerds
and
morons
for
just
being
here
when
you
are
here
spending
more
time
trying
to
defend
shit
that
actually
makes
no
sense
to
anybody
other
than
the
fanboys
who
convince
themselves
that
it
makes
sense
by
breaking
it
down
and
reading
the
books
and
so
on
.
in
closing
fuck
off
.
deebeecooper
is
there
smoke
in
space
oh
well
i
guess
there
wouldnt
be
sound
or
fire
in
space
either
but
at
least
that
didnt
ruin
eps
4
5
.
deebeecooper
i
was
reading
your
post
and
then
you
made
me
wince
strongly
with
mace
windu
and
you
completely
lost
me
at
quigon
sorry
but
samuel
jackson
should
be
black-listed
from
ever
appearing
in
another
star
wars
movie
and
so
should
liam
the
drunk
neeson
.
these
2
were
part
of
the
problem
with
menace
.
deebeecooper
maybe
not
that
complicated
but
like
so
many
other
elements
in
the
movie
it
was
stupid
.
deebeecooper
u
r
either
sick
or
a
troll
either
way
ur
sick..
get
some
help
.
deebeecooper
george
is
that
you
jean-michel
oh
stop
it
you
can
open
up
the
video
in
vlc
or
download
it
with
the
right
tools
.
http
you
will
be
sorely
missed
http
oh
god
please
dont
you
guys
dare
make
money
http
oh
yeah
and
omg
the
world
revolves
around
me
wah
wah
wah
http
he
doesnt
do
anything
he
has
no
arc
.
he
sits
around
all
movie
adds
no
insight
teaches
no
one
anything
and
is
there
to
get
mad
and
beat
darth
maul
at
the
end
.
in
fact
if
you
remove
him
from
the
movie
nothing
changes
.
just
have
qui
gon
beat
maul
.
http
so
because
he
thought
star
trek
was
mediocre
and
not
aweful
youre
boycotting
abrams
is
actually
a
decent
director
he
even
says
theres
good
action
scenes
.
http
oh
by
the
way
you
should
probably
send
redlettermedia
a
check
.
i
mean
if
youre
serious
about
getting
rid
of
ads
.
or
do
you
just
thing
things
you
want
should
be
free
bill
there
can
be
fire
and
sound
but
only
for
as
far
as
the
oxygen
that
is
escaping
the
space
craft
can
carry
it
.
smoke
has
a
physical
property
so
it
could
be
in
space
.
the
trajectory
of
moving
smoke
would
move
out
in
a
lot
of
different
directions
and
would
appear
to
dissipate
quickly
but
it
would
still
be
there
.
it
would
just
be
dispersed
.
wow
that
may
have
been
the
clearest
thinking
ive
ever
posted
on
the
internet
.
cats
and
george
lucas
is
an
ass..
now
everything
is
in
balance
cognitive
schizo
you
know
he
doesnt
know
how
to
do
that
.
i
would
bet
money
he
doesnt
even
have
vlc
on
his
computer
jack
p.
coleman
nice
use
of
an
early
draft
of
star
wars
jack
p.
coleman
i
desperately
hope
youre
being
sarcastic
.
jack
p.
coleman
its
time
to
kill
off
the
jedi
.
oh
good
.
xd
daniel
i
was
just
watching
menace
again
and
was
struck
by
obi-wans
illogical
reaction
to
their
first
encounter
with
darth
maul
just
before
they
leave
tatooine
.
so
obi-wan
was
in
the
ship
expecting
the
return
of
his
master
when
suddenly
the
security
guy
walks
in
saying
qui-gon
is
in
trouble
.
obi-wan
then
calmly
already
a
huge
mistake
walks
towards
the
windshield
and
sees
a
guy
who
has
come
out
of
nowhere
carrying
a
light
saber
and
attacking
qui-gon
.
later
we
learn
at
the
jedi
council
that
the
sith
have
been
extinct
for
a
thousand
years
thus
neither
obi-wan
nor
qui-gon
have
ever
seen
one
.
so
what
should
be
going
through
obi-wans
head
when
he
saw
the
light
saber
fight
who
the
fuck
is
that
guy
i
probably
know
him
because
his
is
obviously
a
jedi
knight
but
why
in
the
hell
would
he
attack
qui-gon
what
was
he
doing
in
the
middle
of
the
desert
to
begin
with
i
must
get
out
there
immediately
and
find
out
who
is
this
guy
.
but
instead
he
sits
at
a
chair
and
says
take
off
.
over
there
fly
low
.
this
is
probably
the
first
time
he
has
ever
seen
a
light
saber
duel
for
real
and
he
is
not
even
slightly
impressed
by
it
.
daniel
another
thing
about
their
fight
at
tatooine
.
why
does
the
probe
have
to
return
and
report
personally
to
darth
maul
couldnt
it
just
send
a
message
isnt
the
point
of
having
probes
to
know
things
without
having
to
actually
be
there
to
see
them
why
would
darth
maul
choose
a
bike
to
get
to
their
ship
when
he
releases
the
probes
it
seems
he
just
stands
there
waiting
so
i
assume
he
is
close
to
his
ship
.
the
best
thing
to
do
would
be
to
get
on
his
ship
and
blow
up
the
naboo
ship
before
it
takes
off
ruining
any
chances
of
escape
.
what
if
he
gets
there
in
the
exact
moment
that
they
are
leaving
he
would
just
stand
there
in
the
sand
looking
stupid
just
like
he
did
.
i
know
nothing
about
script
writing
but
i
think
that
if
darth
maul
got
there
in
his
ship
just
moments
before
they
leave
tatooine
you
could
have
a
quick
chase
scene
before
they
jump
to
hyperspace
and
it
would
keep
the
sith
unknown
to
the
jedi
until
the
fight
sequence
at
naboo
.
this
would
fit
well
with
the
councils
choice
of
sending
just
two
guys
back
to
naboo
and
would
add
tension
to
darth
mauls
revelation
at
the
end
.
tomgarden

heesch
i
went
out
and
bought
pizza
rolls
tonight
to
eat
while
i
watched
plinkett
reviews
.
yezzah
something
that
never
really
occurred
to
me
about
yoda
in
this
movie
.
it
was
awkward
seeing
him
involved
with
politics
and
handing
out
titles
etc
.
he
was
much
more
of
an
impactful
character
when
he
was
a
fugitive
and
tossed
aside
on
a
dumpy
planet
.
it
was
a
much
better
way
to
show
how
his
power
didnt
depend
on
the
typical
trappings
of
the
world
.
to
see
yoda
all
mixed
up
with
political
intrigue
diminished
what
made
him
such
a
memorable
character
.
pennsylguy
hmm
im
bored
.
what
should
i
do
sees
phantom
menace
dvd
lying
around
makes
popcorn
comes
to
this
review
mrpotterfanboy
your
reviews
are
always
great
you
should
definitely
doï
a
movie
review
on
harry
potter
pick
the
one
you
think
is
the
worst
and
do
what
you
do
best
i
would
like
to
see
you
do
a
review
on
harry
potter
and
the
deathly
hallows
part
1
2
.
for
some
reason
a
lot
of
fans
have
found
it
disappointing
.
please
consider
it
thanks
cassie
thats
one
expensive
coaster
you
have
lying
around
.
http
its
hard
to
keep
track
of
story
logic
when
the
finished
script
is
also
the
first
draft
scrawled
on
the
backs
of
applebees
napkins
.
onurb
stfu
jeff
wasnt
akira
kurosawa
originally
included
in
that
list
of
directors
tai
theres
many
difference
between
a
coaster
and
the
phantom
menace
.
one
took
countless
hours
of
effort
care
and
creativity
to
make
and
one
is
a
movie
.
ba
dum
tss
tai
true
but
i
think
the
point
was
that
it
could
have
just
been
anakin
vs
the
ship
since
thats
the
whole
point
anyways
.
whats
even
the
point
of
talking
about
the
entry
fee
tai
i
think
mark
webb
should
be
added
in
there
for
his
film
the
amazing
spiderman
which
broke
new
grounds
.
ive
never
seen
something
quite
so
3d
.

i
am
an
aduuuuuuuullllllllll-
paulis
the
disability
to
describe
ep
1
characters
looked
so
very
fake
while
i
do
agree
that
they
had
little
character
the
problem
was
that
the
character
they
had
was
stereotypical
either
the
public
that
was
questioned
was
faking
it
to
make
a
point
or
they
havent
seen
the
movie
properly
to
speak
of
its
characters
or
just
plain
silly
baz
hood
yeah
man
abrams
is
a
decent
director
.
shame
the
writers
hes
been
working
with
are
unimaginative
hacks
though
.
but
if
he
puts
lens
flare
in
star
wars
supersoup
can
you
describe
any
of
those
characters
from
the
prequels
without
reference
to
anything
physical
about
them
or
what
they
do
in
the
movie
man
im
sick
of
kids
trying
to
defend
these
movies
.
everyone
thought
they
were
shit
when
they
came
out
and
a
reappraisal
just
continues
to
confirm
how
shit
they
are
.
jonah
falcon
heh
.
love
seeing
jay
rich
et
al
in
the
describe
the
character
part
now
that
youve
seen
them
in
half
in
the
bag
and
best
of
the
worst
.
jonah
falcon
rich
that
is
going
to
be
fucking
impossible
because
she
amidala
doesnt
have
a
character
.
hee
hee
wizdumb
oh
my
god
this
is
priceless
.
so
glad
i
was
directed
to
come
here
.
yanda
yes
the
original
trilogy
was
better
but
come
on
man
it
really
wasnt
that
bad
.
and
no
a
new
hopes
lightsaber
battle
was
in
no
way
more
interesting
than
revenge
of
the
siths
with
obi-wan
and
anakin
thats
ridiculus
.
youre
also
a
really
weird
fucking
dude
who
sounds
like
a
constipated
fat
guy
with
down
syndrome
.
jubalbiggs
ok
fine
.
lets
go
with
that
assumption
.
so
the
main
character
stays
behind
on
the
ship
on
tatooine
and
waits
while
three
supporting
characters
do
the
entire
plot
on
that
planet
then
the
mc
sits
around
on
coruscant
while
the
council
decides
something
above
his
pay-grade
and
something
happens
in
the
senate
and
his
job
is
to
stand
around
next
to
his
sensei
dude
and
just
look
serious
.
gee
this
is
like
if
luca
brasi
was
the
main
character
of
the
godfather
thrilling
.
obi
wan
is
a
heavy
.
he
is
like
a
bodyguard
guy
who
gets
periodically
siccced
on
things
.
if
he
actually
is
the
main
character
in
this
movie
that
makes
it
even
more
lame
if
that
were
possible
.
wizdumb
you
win
the
dumbass
of
the
year
award
barry
herbers
im
not
finished
yet
just
started
part
2
and
while
this
is
incredibly
well
done
and
entertaining
i
think
i
have
a
bit
of
a
problem
with
a
pretty
large
part
of
the
way
youre
going
about
this
.
there
are
insights
throughout
but
it
seems
like
most
of
this
is
just
pointing
out
plot
holes
.
sure
theres
something
to
be
said
for
plot
holes
being
able
to
make
a
movie
worse
but
it
seems
like
all
the
video
does
is
point
them
out
.
it
never
explains
why
plot
holes
are
an
issue
.
im
just
not
sure
its
fair
to
point
at
the
plot
holes
as
flaws
in
the
movie
without
explaining
why
there
an
issue
.
i
dont
doubt
for
a
second
that
they
are
in
fact
an
issue
in
the
phantom
menace
but
just
pointing
them
out
isnt
really
worth
doing
unless
youre
going
to
explain
why
youre
pointing
them
out
.
this
is
worth
reading
if
anyones
interested
in
this
particular
topic
http
gest
are
we
watching
the
same
review
barry
herbers
id
certainly
hope
so
and
i
absolutely
loved
this
review
.
i
watched
the
whole
thing
.
andrew
hagan
you
need
someone
to
explain
to
you
why
its
bad
for
a
piece
of
fiction
to
be
incoherent
and
illogical
really
barry
herbers
no
i
picked
up
on
that
for
myself
due
to
other
reading
but
can
you
explain
it
andrew
hagan
thats
like
asking
someone
to
explain
why
the
smell
of
flowers
is
better
than
the
smell
of
rotten
eggs
.
if
you
dont
get
it
youre
an
alien
.
barry
herbers
and
yet
this
genius
of
a
writer
film
crit
hulk
wrote
an
entire
essay
in
an
attempt
to
explain
why
plot
holes
really
arent
that
bad
when
used
under
the
proper
circumstances

why
are
you
plugging
this

so
hard
albert
t.
colon
simple
logic
is
the
issue
why
explain
such
simplicity
its
scifi
sci-fantasy
.
but
the
sci
stands
for
science
meaning
logic
and
reason
rules
and
if
lucass

cant
think
straight
pointing
it
out
alone
is
enough
no
need
for
boring
overkilljust
point
it
out
woosher
there
are
at
least
3
different
movie
reviews
on
this
site
that
detail
exactly
how
much
of
an
idiot
you
are
.
barry
herbers
because
its
mind-blowingly
fantastic
.
tealmm
it
really
isnt
though
tob
and
its
articles
are
in
all
capitals
so
you
know
it
has
something
important
to
say

this

is

im
glad
you
discredit
information
based
on
the
format
.
barry
herbers
im
not
bitter
though
i
loved
the
review
.
what
i
said
above
was
my
only
complaint
and
if
i
remember
correctly
they
ended
up
addressing
it
anyway
.
the
plot
holes
cause
confusion
when
youre
watching
the
movie
making
it
more
difficult
to
be
invested
in
whats
going
on
since
youre
always
questioning
it
.
supersoup
you
missed
the
bits
where
he
points
out
where
it
fails
in
basic
cinematic
terms
.
or
how
hollow
the
characters
are
.
supersoup
or
how
basic
design
choices
and
character
actions
make
no
fucking
sense
.
that
isnt
the
same
as
pointing
out
plot
holes
.
assmonkeyhooker
i
shit
on
your
moms
dick
fuckfartlover
slut
roger
abramson
a
point
made
elsewhere
in
these
reviews
its
not
necessarily
that
plot
holes
take
you
out
of
the
fun
.
the
lack
of
story
and
character
emotionally
distances
you
from
the
movie
leaving
you
bored
picking
apart
the
logical
flaws
and
contrived
plot
devices
.
sloppy
plot
devices
inevitably
leave
plot
holes
.
suddenly
to
a
sharp-minded
viewer
it
all
becomes
insultingly
clear
the
filmmaker
is
a
hack
cramming
a
self-indulgent
checklist
of
all
the
crap
he
wants
to
force
into
his
script
.
its
all
been
contrived
.
flat
characters
illuminate
nothing
about
life
because
hacks
care
far
less
for
the
emotions
and
lives
of
his
audience
than
his
own
cast
of
cardboard
cut-out
characters
.
its
yet
another
money
grab
another
filmmaker
with
nothing
to
say
and
his
characters
have
nowhere
to
go
and
nothing
to
do
.
to
those
who
arent
dazzled
by
empty
spectacle
who
want
substance
instead
of
sparklers
theres
nothing
behind
the
theater
curtain
but
a
drunken
idiot
sloppily
setting
off
one
bottle
rocket
after
another
to
the
oohs
and
aahs
of
the
witless
throng
.
character-driven
stories
in
the
classical
3-act
format
dont
need
chases
or
heists
or
explosions
to
delight
and
amaze
us
.
remember
the
white-knuckle
suspense
in
the
first
scene
in
the
recent
film
drive
there
was
more
tension
in
a
few
seconds
waiting
at
a
stop
light
than
an
entire
james
bond
movie
.
in
act
2
a
movie
tends
to
bog
down
.
in
empire
strikes
back
luke
ends
up
in
an
actual
bog
with
a
wise
swamp
frog
who
causes
him
to
face
himself
before
his
journey
can
continue
.
one
day
we
all
have
to
face
ourselves
just
like
luke
does
.
as
they
say
in
the
three
amigos
each
of
us
has
an
el
guapo
.
an
inner
struggle
caused
by
deep
but
surmountable
imperfection
.
like
my
fair
lady
or
its
variations
we
witness
a
make-over
story
.
we
go
from
robot-loving
nerds
to
responsible
human
beings
.
the
kind
of
people
who
would
never
make
a
crappy
movie
like
the
phantom
menace
for
the
merchandising
royalties
.
hell
.
lucas
was
supposed
to
be
the
chosen
one
.
or
something
like
that
.
by
working
through
lukes
fundamental
inner
conflicts
and
facing
the
shocking
realities
about
himself
along
with
all
the
natural
twists
and
turns
of
the
story
resulting
from
his
flaws
we
really
feel
the
moments
of
transformation
through
struggle
the
growing
courage
and
admire
the
developing
inner
strength
as
if
it
was
our
own
.
in
act
2
nothing
needs
to
blow
up
.
he
hides
out
in
a
swamp
while
his
buddies
hide
out
in
a
cave
.
just
a
boy
and
a
talking
frog
.
were
not
pulled
out
of
the
story
.
we
suspend
our
disbelief
forgive
any
logical
contradictions
and
we
dont
complain
when
yoda
doesnt
simply
offer
to
lend
luke
his
egg-shaped
space
car
or
send
obi-wans
ghost
to
go
call
a
tow
truck
for
his
x-wing
.
creative
brilliant
and
rational
minds
are
pulled
into
the
plot
holes
by
unrelenting
boredom
.
when
were
entertained
and
enlightened
we
dont
give
a
damn
.
hope
it
helps
.
barry
herbers
thank
you
.
thats
exactly
the
kind
of
reply
i
was
hoping
for
.
gborr
do
you
guys
know
what
the
greatest
joke
is
once
you
read
up
on
the
background
of
the
trade
federation
and
all
the
other
background
politics
and
whatnot
the
core
plot
of
the
movie
is
actually
good
.
it
makes
sense
in
that
context
.
the
problem
is
you
see
nothing
of
that
in
the
movie
.
you
never
get
to
learn
why
the
trade
federation
is
a
threat
you
never
get
to
know
why
they
have
armed
ships
and
droid
armies
you
never
learn
the
political
machinations
in
the
background
.
nothing
and
no
you
dont
need
several
minutes
long
exposition
in
the
senate
to
do
that
either
.
here
let
me
demonstrate
qui
gon
and
obi
wans
ship
gets
out
of
hyperspace
and
the
look
upon
naboo
and
the
tf
fleet
around
it
captain
according
to
the
sensors
we
have
three
times
as
much
ships
as
expected
.
all
of
them
are
armed
.
obi
wan
thats
not
an
embargo
fleet
that
is
an
invasion
what
is
the
trade
federation
doing
qui
gon
what
they
have
been
doing
in
the
past
few
years
.
they
have
been
using
the
credits
of
their
corporate
allies
to
lobby
in
the
senate
arm
their
ships
and
amass
their
fleets
.
now
that
money
doesnt
do
the
trick
anymore
they
try
to
bully
the
republic
with
brute
force
.
obi
wan
the
republic
had
grown
to
complacent
in
peace
.
qui
gon
there
is
no
such
thing
as
being
too
peaceful
but
it
is
true
that
the
republic
doesnt
have
the
means
to
defend
itself
against
this
aggression
.
obi
wan
looks
over
the
huge
ships
as
they
get
ready
to
dock
obi
wan
i
still
dont
understand
master
.
do
they
really
expect
the
republic
would
give
them
what
they
want
like
this
it
makes
no
sense
.
qui
gon
no
it
doesnt
.
not
yet
.
and
that
worries
me
.
obi
wan
why
qui
gon
because
that
means
they
have
the
power
to
threaten
the
republic
the
incentive
to
do
so
and
a
plan
we
know
nothing
about
.
its
the
most
dangerous
combination
possible
.
scene
cuts
with
the
hangar
doors
slowly
closing
behind
the
ship
bam
suddenly
the
trade
federation
sounds
like
a
genuine
threat
and
all
it
took
was
two
minutes
of
expository
dialog
between
the
two
lead
characters
that
doesnt
even
sound
that
forced
.
contrast
this
with
georges
approach
who
just
threw
thousands
of
droids
onto
the
screen
and
thought
that
was
enough
.
japneet
dhaliwal
that
blockade
was
also
completely
useless
.
blockades
are
supposed
to
surround
the
area
that
blockade
on
the
other
hand
was
like
a
ring
in
saturn
they
could
escape
from
literally
any
other
direction
.
gborr
and
again
do
you
know
how
easy
is
that
to
explain
interdiction
fields
they
are
used
to
create
artificial
gravity
wells
and
stop
ships
from
escaping
an
area
of
engagement
by
hyperdrive
or
even
pull
them
out
of
hyperspace
and
the
technology
have
existed
for
thousands
of
years
at
this
point
its
used
by
malak
in
kotor
to
intercept
the
ebon
hawk
at
one
point
.
all
lucas
had
to
do
was
inserting
this
simple
line
into
any
of
the
dialog
either
during
the
very
beginning
or
when
they
try
to
escape
naboo
the
first
time
qui
gon
the
ships
orbiting
around
the
equator
use
interdiction
fields
to
stop
any
large
ships
from
entering
or
leaving
the
system
while
the
fighter
droids
are
patrolling
the
rest
of
the
space
around
the
planet
to
hunt
down
small
ships
trying
to
smuggle
supplies
.
however
that
also
means
that
they
have
no
fighters
around
the
ships
themselves
and
those
are
only
armed
freighters
so
we
could
break
through
with
a
small
and
fast
ship
by
flying
right
at
them
and
leave
interdiction
range
before
they
could
scramble
more
fighters
.
bam
stupid
blockade
is
solved
.

gborr
late
answer
but
relevant
the
trade
federation
is
an
alliance
of
the
most
wealth
corporations
and
planets
the
sith
are
manipulating
them
read
sidious
through
their
greed
to
destroy
the
republic
from
within
and
they
want
padme
dead
because
nute
gunray
the
head
honcho
of
the
tf
feels
offended
by
her
gall
to
capture
him
in
the
first
movie
.
it
also
explains
their
name
they
are
an
alliance
of
the
biggest
manufacturers
traders
and
bankers
of
the
galaxy
their
droid
armies
since
they
have
the
backing
of
several
huge
manufacturing
firms
and
their
desire
to
kill
padme
in
particular
.
its
just
that
the
movies
have
a
narrative
that
suffers
from
add
and
refuses
to
explain
anything
instead
opting
to
throw
digital
shit
at
the
audience
and
hopes
that
they
forget
about
the
horribly
storytelling
.
lostboy408
what
the
hell
is
with
this
guys
voice
haitchpeasauce
and
then
the
battle
droids
are
complete
rubbish
.
lucas
doesnt
give
appropriate
exposition
about
the
threat
and
couldnt
back
it
up
with
substantial
danger
and
tension
even
if
he
did
.
everyone
in
the
movie
is
stupid
so
the
core
plot
is
driven
by
idiots
making
the
core
plot
stupid
too
making
the
movie
maker
well
you
get
it
.
gborr
you
dream
of
a
better
movie
that
was
never
made
and
id
pay
to
see
that
movie
.
haitchpeasauce
polio
ruined
his
childhood
.
welcome
to
plinkett
.
gborr
at
one
point
i
actually
had
a
checklist
of
small
things
that
should
have
been
changed
to
make
the
phantom
menace
work
.
stuff
like
-explain
the
trade
federation
as
seen
above
.
-explain
that
the
naboo
queen
is
actually
only
a
diplomatic
figurehead
who
periodically
gets
chose
from
the
noble
families
and
stripped
from
the
title
at
a
certain
age
because
of
stupid
traditions
.
-make
it
so
that
the
trade
federation
doesnt
want
to
kill
qui
gon
and
obi
wan
outright
but
only
bear
down
on
them
when
they
try
to
snoop
around
the
hangar
bay
and
notice
the
invasion
force
.
-make
qui
gon
very
knowledgeable
and
flexible
and
make
obi
wan
very
impulsive
with
a
rigid
moral
fiber
.
-keep
jar-jar
but
make
him
a
pained
man
in
exile
instead
of
the
silly
clown
.
the
funny
accent
can
stay
it
works
as
a
juxtaposition
.
-explain
the
blockade
the
way
i
did
somewhere
around
here
in
short
the
big
ships
are
only
there
for
interdiction-fields
the
atmosphere
is
patrolled
by
fighter
droids
and
the
battleships
are
only
retrofitted
cargo
haulers
so
they
dont
have
the
firepower
to
stop
a
fast
ship
with
good
shields
.
-drop
the
bits
with
r2d2
especially
the
thanking
the
droid
bit
.
he
should
be
introduced
either
on
tatooine
they
buy
him
to
help
with
the
repairs
of
the
ship
or
when
they
get
back
to
naboo
as
one
of
the
fighter
astromech
droids
anakin
bonds
with
.
-introduce
darth
maul
earlier
and
give
him
a
simple
straightforward
backstory
of
hating
the
jedi
and
stalk
the
main
group
for
a
while
.
-make
anakin
older
at
least
fourteen
.
also
make
him
less
wide-eyed
innocent
and
more
jaded
he
is
a
slave
for
gods
sake
and
show
him
to
be
generally
nice
but
manipulative
from
the
get-go
.
also
make
him
want
to
become
a
jedi
so
that
he
could
get
away
from
tatooine
.
-drop
the
anakin
made
c3po
stupidity
.
in
fact
it
would
make
sense
if
c3po
was
on
the
queens
ship
you
know
protocol
droid
and
he
is
taken
to
the
planet
in
case
they
need
translating
.
-drop
the
subplot
about
qui
gon
betting
.
instead
make
obi
wan
do
the
bets
for
money
instead
of
the
parts
behind
his
back
and
make
qui
gin
chastise
him
for
it
-
character
development
-keep
the
midichlorians
but
make
them
into
an
indicator
instead
of
a
means
aka
.
they
are
not
allowing
the
use
of
the
force
but
are
drawn
to
those
strong
in
the
force
.
also
dont
give
it
a
numerical
value
instead
make
obi
wan
say
the
boys
midichlorian
count
is
very
high
.
its
comparable
to
master
yodas
.
and
the
qui
gon
respond
strange
.
i
didnt
feel
it
in
him
.
he
must
have
great
untapped
potential..
-make
it
so
that
padme
stays
on
the
ship
and
she
only
meets
anakin
when
he
shows
up
to
check
the
ship
and
see
what
parts
are
needed
on
wattos
orders
.
-make
the
pod-race
shorter
and
without
the
whole
melodrama
about
the
sabotage
and
whatnot
.
just
have
anakin
use
wattos
pod-racer
and
barely
win
thats
more
than
enough
tension
right
there
.
-make
it
so
that
they
win
enough
money
to
either
buy
both
anakin
and
shmi
or
only
anakin
and
all
the
parts
needed
and
then
make
shmi
make
the
decision
to
stay
behind
in
order
to
get
her
son
out
of
there
.
make
qui
gon
and
obi
wan
promise
that
they
would
get
back
to
her
.
-when
darth
maul
first
attacks
the
jedi
as
they
try
to
leave
have
qui
gon
and
obi
wan
be
confused
as
hell
and
act
a
little
sloppy
.
this
is
supposed
to
be
the
first
time
they
have
seen
a
sith
in
generations
and
they
are
in
no
ways
trained
in
direct
saber-duels
so
they
should
only
barely
escape
or
even
get
injured
a
little
.
-have
two
important
scenes
on
the
ship
obi
wan
bonding
with
anakin
as
they
are
not
that
far
apart
in
age
and
have
obi
wan
acknowledge
his
potential
and
encourage
him
that
the
jedi
council
would
certainly
see
it
as
well
.
the
other
scene
should
be
between
padme
and
jar-jar
where
they
both
voice
their
feelings
of
desperation
and
worry
for
their
people
and
that
they
try
to
uphold
a
collected
and
cheery
exterior
so
that
they
wouldnt
have
to
think
about
it
.
-when
they
get
to
coruscant
have
multiple
scenes
detailing
qui
gon
looking
into
the
sith
in
the
archives
note
how
maul
seemed
to
be
a
skilled
fighter
yet
his
saber-technique
was
unusual
and
sloppy
at
times
.
-have
the
council
refuse
to
train
anakin
on
the
grounds
of
age
emotional
baggage
and
have
obi
wan
protest
the
decision
.
-when
they
return
to
naboo
have
anakin
stove
away
on
the
ship
because
he
wants
to
prove
himself
.
the
rest
of
the
scenes
kind
of
work
but
with
less
cutting
between
them
.
-have
anakin
defy
qui
gons
order
to
stay
back
and
instead
rush
into
the
battle
and
get
into
one
of
the
vacant
naboo
fighters
originally
planning
to
use
the
ships
cannons
to
shoot
at
the
droids
on
the
ground
but
then
r2
gets
attached
and
so
anakin
gets
the
idea
to
actually
follow
the
formation
and
fly
the
thing
.
-when
darth
maul
shows
up
make
the
jedi
have
a
little
oh
crap
moment
especially
when
he
shows
up
his
double-blader
.
have
qui
gon
note
that
it
is
just
as
he
feared
and
that
it
is
a
type
of
lightsaber
that
was
designed
for
duels
between
force
users
so
he
tells
obi
wan
to
make
sure
their
attacks
are
synchronized
so
that
they
can
keep
him
off-balance
and
wont
have
to
fight
one
on
one
-in
space
have
anakin
realize
that
the
droid
control
ships
shields
momentarily
shit
down
around
the
hangar
when
it
dispatches
new
fighters
and
make
him
use
the
window
of
opportunity
to
fly
in
fire
all
his
proton
torpedoes
.
the
hit
a
reactor
just
like
in
the
actual
movie
that
temporarily
disables
the
shields
and
disrupts
the
droids
giving
the
other
fighters
enough
time
to
bombard
the
core
of
the
ship
and
blow
it
up
.
-in
the
fight
between
the
two
jedi
and
maul
have
things
play
out
similarly
except
at
the
end
maul
separates
them
and
starts
sadistically
mincing
up
the
limbs
of
qui
gon
and
then
impaling
him
when
he
is
only
the
ground
enraging
obi
wan
.
then
have
obi
wan
rush
in
bashing
maul
over
and
over
with
his
saber
like
it
was
a
baseball
bat
but
then
maul
starts
to
play
with
him
as
well
injuring
his
leg
.
the
pain
makes
obi
wan
momentarily
focus
remembering
qui
gons
note
about
how
the
siths
technique
with
a
single
blade
was
sloppy
and
in
a
sudden
spark
of
inspiration
he
lunges
up
force-pulls
the
fallen
jedis
saber
and
while
blocking
with
his
own
he
uses
it
to
cut
the
hilt
of
mauls
saber
in
half
.
not
expecting
this
maul
stumbles
backwards
and
then
drops
one
of
the
half-sabers
but
by
that
time
obi
wan
uses
the
two
blades
in
his
hands
to
slice
him
in
half
while
he
is
too
distracted
to
defend
properly
the
force-pushes
the
two
halves
into
the
pit
with
a
roar
.
-have
the
ending
play
out
as
in
the
movie
with
the
jadi
council
grudgingly
allowing
obi
wan
to
train
anakin
after
he
is
promoted
and
then
end
with
the
two
of
them
returning
to
tatooine
to
free
shmi
.
once
they
free
her
she
says
she
want
to
stay
behind
because
all
her
friends
are
here
so
she
says
goodbye
to
anakin
who
is
already
in
a
robe
at
this
point
and
promises
her
that
by
the
next
time
she
sees
him
he
is
going
to
be
the
greatest
jedi
who
ever
lived
and
cue
credits
while
the
camera
pans
up
to
the
twin
suns
and
creating
a
thematic
bridge
with
luke
leaving
his
old
life
behind
in
new
hope
.
bam
there
you
go
a
tolerable
movie
right
there
.
jack
dude
you
still
kinda
missed
the
point
.
we
get
told
how
dangerous
this
might
be
.
doesnt
compare
to
beginning
your
movie
with
a
storm
trooper
battle
and
a
darth
vader
throat
cuddle
.

is
lucas
now
the

not

plug
these
holes
with
the
most
basic
of
expository

you
saw
but
those
characters
certainly
werent
in
the
one
i
watched

hey
i
can
do
it
too
.
qui-gon
an
alcoholic
who
refuses
to
go
into

rehab
against
yodas
advice
.
always
fucking
up
the
missions
with
his
lack
of
common

a
young
girl
from
a
society
where
they
have
to
lobotomize
future
royalty
and
teach
them
to
be
as
one
dimensional
as
possible
for
political
reasons
.
obi-wan
a
whiner
who
doesnt
really
care
about
anything
the
jedi
do
and
has
been
fighting
to
get
out
his
whole
life
.
he
likes
to
swing
laser
swords

so
he
pretends
to
care

anakin
a
bad

who
went
insane
from
slavery
to
the
extent
that
he
runs
around
yelling
yippee
while
he
lives
in

and
i
think
mine
have
far
more
evidence
from
the
movie

moeskido
i

was
probably
one
of
only

people
who
could
keep

from
disappearing
up
his
own
ass
.
http
plinkett
uses
a
phrase
at
one
point
in
his
review
art
thru
adversity
.
getting
the
original
trilogy
made
was
difficult
and
problematic
the
original
certainly
the
most
difficult
.
lucas
was
surrounded
by
industry
professionals
whose
job
was
to
make
these
productions
work
and
to
add
insight
direction
and
ideas
along
the
way
.
lucas
was
surrounded
by
sycophants
and
yes-men
for
the
prequels
and
it
shows
.
he
sat
on
his
ass
with
his
coffee
and
his
monitors
.
the
paucity
of
the
result
is
obvious
.
moeskido
plinketts
a
smart
man
who
has
genuine
standards
for
good
storytelling
.
one
of
lucasfilms
many
mistakes
was
in
allowing
consumers
to
actually
view
the
production
process
in
the
dvd
extras
.
watching
lucas
department
chiefs
repeatedly
swap
nervous
glances
while
they
nod
enthusiastically
at
his
every
change-of-mind
about
non-story
details
reminds
me
of
nothing
less
than
outtakes
from
the
office
.
gborr
hey
im
just
working
with
what
i
got
if
it
was
depending
on
me
i
would
have
started
the
movie
at
the
naboo
capital
itself
with
the
droid
armies
marching
down
on
the
streets
.
maybe
show
a
few
frightened
women
and
children
peeking
through
windows
while
the
droids
mechanically
march
down
the
street
there
could
even
be
some
fires
and
wrecks
littering
the
streetside
aftermath
of
the
battle
etc
.
then
cut
to
the
droid
army
finally
taking
the
palace
and
then
have
nute
gunray
possibly
accompanied
by
darth
maul
capture
padme
and
then
when
they
get
to
her
have
qui
gon
and
obi
wan
rescue
her
in
the
nick
of
time
and
then
they
would
have
to
hide
out
possibly
in
the
swamp
with
the
gungans
.
this
way
there
would
have
been
a
immediate
representation
of
the
power
of
the
droid
army
darth
maul
could
have
proved
an
adversary
for
the
jedi
from
the
very
beginning
there
would
have
been
no
jar-jar
and
all
the
nonsense
in
the
first
ten
minutes
of
the
movie
etc
.
etc
.
etc
.
but
then
again
that
would
require
rewriting
the
entire
script
from
the
get-go
and
as
i
said
somewhere
around
here
when
i
wrote
up
these
ideas
my
main
goal
was
to
tweak
the
already
existing
content
in
a
way
to
show
how
easy
it
would
have
been
to
fix
things
with
just
a
minimal
amount
of
care
.
gborr
the
random
asshat
was
supposed
to
be
me
a
random
guy
from
the
net
who
could
still
do
a
better
job
at
pluggin
up
said
plot-holes
from
his
arm-chair
while
lucas
supposedly
had
his
directing
genius
and
a
hundred
assistants
and
still
failed
to
do
so
.
so
yeah
i
still
hold
that
0-1
score
.

perfect
.
lnldzn
wow
gborr
i
can
see
this
movie
play
in
my
mind
while
im
reading
your
comment
and
its
way
better
than
lucas
version
i
wish
it
were
made
someday
id
pay
to
watch
it
.
hats
off
to
you
lnldzn
oh
and
heres
my
own
suggestion
of
an
improvement
change
the
viceroys
from
the
bumbling
idiots
they
are
into
something
more
worthy
of
carrying
out
the
main
villains
plan
.
or
if
you
really
want
them
to
stay
the
way
they
are
make
it
absolutely
clear
that
its
darth
maul
whos
actually
calling
the
shots
on
the
ground
and
that
the
viceroys
are
only
tools
acting
as
a
front
for
the
sith
maybe
even
have
maul
show
some
impatience
at
their
incompetence
because
as
things
stand
in
the
movie
you
have
a
shadowy
figure
trying
to
carry
out
an
overly
complicated
plan
with
the
worst
hench
people
imaginable
which
doesnt
say
much
for
his
overall
quality
as
a
competent
villain
.
its
just
a
pair
of
idiots
getting
beaten
by
another
bunch
of
even
bigger
idiots
.
theres
no
emotional
involvement
in
taking
the
federation
down
derrick
cryderman

really
fucko

id
rather
watch
this
than
the
actual
movie
max
look
mate
youre
making
a
whole
lot
of
good
points
and
you
know
what
the
hell
are
you
talking
about
but
your
video
is
unwatchable
i
wont
go
as
far
as
to
suggest
its
worse
than
the
prequels
dont
want
to
end
up
in
your
basement
but
god
damn
drink
a
fucking
coffee
before
recording
your
voice
i
honestly
forced
myself
to
watch
half
of
the
first
part
because
yes
you
make
sense
and
help
me
learn
a
lot
about
storytelling
but
your
voice
sounds
like
an
overworked
wallmart
clerk
who
just
wants
to
finish
his
shift
and
ho
the
hell
home
i
find
your
voice
utterly
painful
to
listen
to
if
you
cant
get
any
more
energetic
even
with
a
shot
of
amphetamine
ask
someone
to
record
it
for
you
when
the
scene
in
the
basement
rolled
in
i
was
both
bored
tired
of
listening
to
you
and
embarassed
by
watching
how
you
jar-jar-ly
try
to
shove
in
several
jokes
about
your
basement
dude
youre
not
funny
.
i
clicked
a
link
on
cracked
hoping
its
an
article
to
read
.
was
disappointed
seeing
its
just
videos
but
then
decided
to
try
and
watch
it
and
please
put
it
in
an
article
form
maybe
decorated
with
pictures
or
videos
beacause
the
video
youve
put
together
is
just
unwatchable
ps
.
at
least
for
me
others
seem
to
enjoy
it
so
im
just
gon
na
assume
im
the
fucked
up
one
.
jjtoob
agreed
but
is
still
better
than
what
we
got
by
a
long
shot
.
tyrone
d.
no
youre
an
idiot
firstly
and
i
dont
want
you
ruining
crackeds
basically
good
reputation
by
giving
the
impression
that
only
folks
who
dont
understand
sarcasm
like
you
read
their
articles
.
go
home
find
a
sense
of
humor
and
come
back
later
.
jen
it
is
apparent
that
you
only
expect
to
learn
things
from
polished
black-on-white
discursive
essays
and
perfect
recordings
of
radio-voiced
presenters.you
missed
the
point
entirely
my
friend
so
ill
spell
it
out
for
you
.
mike
stoklasa
and
jay
bauman
are
talented
filmmakers
who
make
informed
decisions
when
expressing
their
subject
matter
.
presenting
your
thoughts
even
if
you
barely
have
an
ounce
of
creativity
should
mean
considering
aesthetics
and
audience
.
the
mode
in
which
you
present
content
can
be
as
important
to
your
point
as
what
you
say
and
from
this
combination
the
audience
derives
meaning
.
you
dont
get
a
pizza
roll
.
max
okay
i
may
not
have
been
clear
and
probably
a
bit
drunk
too
for
which
i
apologize
.
my
main
point
was
not
that
it
was
unfunny
tho
i
still
think
the
scene
in
basement
was
useless
but
that
the
voice
made
it
really
difficult
to
watch
.
it
felt
uninterested
and
boring
regardless
of
what
it
was
saying
.
and
hoping
this
will
let
me
avoid
dealing
with
people
like
you
i
specifically
added
the
ps
.
go
ahead
and
read
it
.
by
the
way
second
part
was
much
better
maybe
because
i
got
used
to
the
voice
.
but
i
still
upheld
what
i
said
before
i
absolutely
hated
the
voice
and
found
it
hard
to
focus
on
the
words
.
that
is
my
opinion
and
if
you
have
a
problem
with
it
well
your
problem
.
but
i
do
apologize
for
the
way
i
have
expressed
it
it
was
a
bit
over
the
top
.
i
was
just
tired
of
listening
to
someone
who
didnt
seem
like
he
even
cared
about
what
was
he
saying
sounding
tired
and
bored
himself
and
so
when
it
got
to
the
basement
scene
i
could
not
hold
it
anymore
.
again
i
was
quite
drunk
and
went
too
far
i
apologize
especially
since
the
videos
does
raise
many
valid
points
.
i
just
felt
sad
it
was
recorded
in
a
way
i
found
hard
to
listen
.
and
was
drunk
which
was
sad
too

if

criticizes
my

i
can
just
say
its
stylistically
designed
to
be
that
way

whats

is
that

falz
ive
never
seen
so
clearly
until
now
the
most
memorable
figures
and
scenes
are
those
that
made
me
feel
hatred
.
sãbastien
st-pierre
robert
you
know
what
to
do
enthos
youre
describing
traits
.
the
objective
is
to
describe
personality
thats
what
makes
a
character
memorable
.
usually
this
comes
from
an
actor
but
can
also
come
from
writing
.
no
characters
in
the
prequels
are
nearly
as
interesting
or
memorable
as
the
characters
in
the
originals
.
to
me
they
just
seem
like
people
who
do
and
say
things
the
plot
needs
them
to
say
rather
than
people
with
motivations
that
may
not
actually
be
the
case
but
the
problem
is
thats
the
way
it
comes
across
.
and
thats
what
matters
.
alex
lee
another
irony
is
that
by
the
character
test
jar
jar
is
actually
one
of
the
stronger
characters
hes
the
comic
relief
hes
goofy
hes
foolish
and
hes
bumbling
.
when
you
compare
him
to
queen
amidala
or
captain
panaka
or
shimi
skywalker
all
of
whom
cant
be
described
outside
of
their
roles
.
jar
jar
is
a
character
people
hate
but
hes
not
technically
poorly
characterized
.
its
a
bizarre
difference
but
thats
the
conclusion
were
left
with
when
performing
this
test
.
ikari
rapeman
shit
youre
stupid
mel
b
toast
youre
filling
in
the
gaps
yourselfvery
little
of
what
you
describe
is
on
the
screenpage
.
or
its
just
something
that
happens
without
emotional
weight
.
i
could
say
that
qui-gon
loves
hot
beverages
because
he
drinks
some
tea
.
that
doesnt
mean
its
an
inherent
part
of
his
personality
.
qui-gon
a
stoic
rather
serious
man
stoic
serious
and
other
synonyms
actors
delivering
dialogue
in
a
monotone
with
blank
faces
.
not
part
of
a
personality
.
who
is
still
a
bit
of
a
rebel
.
you
mean
he
has
mild
disagreements
with
the
jedi
council
he
has
an
innate
sense
for
how
people
can
be
helpful
he
brings
characters
along
who
end
up
being
helpful
by
accident
or
for
plot
convenience
.
not
the
same
thing
.
and
hes
willing
to
defy
his
elders
same
thing
as
rebellious
.
using
multiple
synonyms
does
not
equal
a
rich
personality
.
heres
my
description
of
qui-gon
blank
vacant
hollow
impassive
lifeless
empty
stiff
deadpan
inexpressive
mask-like
and
poker-faced
.
what
a
multifaceted
character
padme
a
girl
thrust
into
a
position
of
power
her
gender
and
occupation
before
she
is
prepared
for
it
her
age
she
tries
to
be
strong
for
her
people
not
shown
through
dialogue
or
action
.
but
inside
her
heart
is
breaking
not
shown
through
dialogue
or
action
.
she
enjoys
pretending
to
be
a
servant
not
shown
through
dialogue
or
action
.
for
the
sole
reason
that
she
gets
to
show
her
emotions
ill
grant
you
that
she
is
less
stiff
in
her
handmaiden
costume
.
but
this
idea
that
she
cant
show
emotions
as
a
queen
makes
no
sense
and
isnt
supported
by
anything
in
the
movie
.
obi-wan
a
serious
practical
man
yes
every
actor
in
this
movie
is
serious
.
who
tends
to
look
at
the
force
as
more
of
a
tool
than
a
source
of
guidance
.
i
remember
zero
scenes
that
indicate
this
.
he
is
not
as
comfortable
with
rebellion
as
his
master
and
tends
to
avoid
unnecessary
risks
you
mean
he
has
mild
disagreements
with
qui-gon
anakin
a
boy
growing
up
in
a
horrible
situation
his
gender
.
and
you
avoided
the
word
slave
but
youre
still
talking
about
his
occupation
.
shielded
from
the
bitter
reality
of
his
life
by
his
kind
master
and
loving
mother
.
are
you
referring
to
the
part
where
his
master
yells
at
him
for
not
working
hard
enough
or
when
anakin
talks
about
the
explosive
device
in
his
head
hes
a
dreamer
i
wouldnt
classify
i
dont
want
to
be
a
slave
as
a
dreamer
.
never
satisfied
until
hes
the
best
at
something
hes
already
a
droid
engineer
and
pod
racer
at
age
nine
.
that
implies
natural
intelligence
or
midichlorians
.
we
never
see
him
struggle
to
become
the
best
at
anything
.
but
he
does
grow
up
to
become
very
serious
.

this
is
exactly
what
you
expect
from
any

spoonfeeds
you
humor

it

its
no
better
than
those

you
used
to
get
full
of
oh-so-funny
jokes
that
also
missed
the
point
because
the
were
failed

entirely
superficial
and
not
funny

i
would
like
nearly
every
gaming
review
made
after
2007
to
be
reshot
with
a
non-annoying
female
or
a
non-faux-radio-voice-douche
because
apparently
g4
has
solidified
in
peoples
minds
what
gamers
want
in
a
game
review
is
chirpy
annoying
girls
reading
lines
with
no
intelligence
behind
their
eyes
or
extremely
annoying
wacky
radio
voices
that
just
sound
douchy
talking
about
nintendo
power
tips
as
if
theyre
un-googleable
at
this
point
.
you
either
hear
vidya
voodoo
organically
which
is
usually
made
up
or
wrong
or
you
get
in
from
a
source
which
may
contain
spoilers
and
is
less
bad
ass
doing
a
combination
of
both
very
badly
is
counter
intuitive
to
gaming
culture
.
of
course
i
would
like
this
but
its
just
not
happening
because
the
fans
of
the
nostalgia
chick
website
and
similar
somesuch
things
dont
care
its
complete
crap
its
being
made
for
them
.
crossover
episodes
of

communities
is
when
it
can
get
really
annoying
super
quick
.
watching
alton
brown
on
whatever
lameass
nerd
cooking
show
he
was
on
is
pretty
much
the
epitome
of
everything
i
hate
in
the
world
but
they
will
continue
to
churn
on
that
garbage
because
people
like
you
just
want
to
see
mildly
attractive
people
dressed
up
like
what
the
kids
of
a
corporate
executive
would
think

look
like

the

if
you
cant

and
you
hate
the
content
generated
get
off
the
internet
.
you
probably
ignored
its
existence
for
the
past
20
years
and
now
you
want
it
to
do
your
bidding
now
that
work
forced
you
to
use
it
even

that
sounds

i
bet
he
accessed
this

from
a
public

after
watching

next
to
some
12
year

doing
a

alfie
mcdonald
i
skipped
school
on
may
21
1999
to
go
see
this
stupid
movie
.
http
that
was
doubly
stupid
because
the
movie
came
out
on
the
19thso
you
probably
didnt
even
need
to
skip
school
but
i
did
toowe
were
young
and
inexperienced
in
life
lets
not
blame
blame
ourselves
http
in
other
words
the
ones
that
made
you
feel
something
.
marvin
falz
yes
you
can
say
that
.
the
ones
that
made
me
feel
something
with
mesa
going
home
being
the
absolute
lowpoint
followed
by
im
a
person
and
my
name
is
anakin
and
jar-jars
great
military
tactic
of
stumbling
around
with
a
battle
droid
clinging
to
his
leg
and
the
stupid
thank-you-r2-d2
scene
.
but
there
is
one
very
short
part
of
the
movie
i
associate
with
a
feeling
of
awe
and
that
is
in
the
opening
scene
when
we
see
the
half-eaten
donut
in
front
of
naboo
in
a
full
shot
and
from
slightly
above
.
spec
3
minutes
and
the
vid
still
isnt
playing
.
im
off
mayra
s.
menezes
panaka
in
portuguese
means
dork
.
captain
dork
was
a
comic
relief
in
brazil-.-
alex
lee
eh
he
didnt
want
to
wait
in
the
massive
line
.
he
was
waiting
for
it
to
become
just
an
oversized
line
.
tapewormbike
we
basicly
took
like
a
family
trip
to
cinema
and
it
was
a
huge
fucking
thing
since
we
did
not
do
that
so
often
.
the
only
other
time
i
remember
was
going
to
the
lost
world
.
man
my
parents
mightve
been
trying
to
ruin
my
childhood
while
i
was
experiencing
it
.
tapewormbike
they
might
be
huge
dicks
tapewormbike
i
remember
it
blowing
my
mind
when
mike
points
that
out
in
the
plinkett
phantom
menace
commentary
.
jar
jar
is
the
only
one
with
proper
arc
.
godhe
might
be
key
to
all
of
this
.
tapewormbike
it
is
pretty
close
to
czech
expression
for
shot
of
booze
so
theres
your
idea
for
a
drinking
game
slam
one
down
whenever
captain
dork
shows
up
.
marvin
falz
jar
jar
is
the
other
part
of
the
phantom
menace
the
first
being
palpatine
because
hes
the
idiot
who
falls
for
palpatines
suggestion
to
propose
that
the
senate
gives
immediate
emergency
powers
to
the
supreme
chancellor
.
jar
jar
proposal
introduces
a
turning
point
from
which
everything
in
the
republic
gets
worse
very
fast
.
alex
lee
after
having
to
study
paradise
lost
i
have
to
comment
on
the
protagonist
part
.
it
is
considered
that
the
protagonist
in
that
poem
is
adam
but
he
doesnt
show
up
until
book
4
out
of
12
books
.
up
until
then
it
was
just
satan
trying
to
get
to
eden
and
gods
ridiculously
circuitous
plan
to
give
jesus
a
chance
to
sacrifice
himself
.
and
all
the
events
that
happen
in
genesis
is
also
out
of
his
control
.
so
i
would
say
that
the
protagonist
doesnt
have
to
be
at
the
beginning
of
the
story
though
heshe
should
.
so
yeah
anakin
is
the
protagonist
in
this
movie
.
eh
still
dont
like
anakin
all
that
much
.
alex
lee
its
so
weird
too
considering
that
stormtroopers
are
dangerous
even
though
they
keep
missing
and
dont
shoot
that
many
lasers
either
.
but
the
droids
despite
being
relatively
on
target
since
they
deflect
the
bolts
instead
of
dodging
them
are
still
no
threat
at
all
.
alex
lee
it
kinda
defeats
the
purpose
of
a
body
double
when
youre
in
the
same
room
as
they
are
.
great
plan
there
padme
.
meanpooh
i
love
listening
to
these
while
doing
homework
.
im
f8cking
addicted
to
this
site
tapewormbike
im
the
same
with
work
.
and
i
bet
output
from
both
of
us
sucks
.
thank
you

still
make

just
every
now

qui
gonn
jinn
.
i
dont
remember
that
character
.
and
he
gets
the
most
screen
time
of
any
character
.
tapewormbike
most
of
the
things
concerning
prequels
are
now
just..sad
.
shazzbaa
no
no
think
about
it
.
theres
someone
who
meets
the
jedi
and
thus
joins
the
main
plot
very
early
on
starts
out
in
kind
of
a
bad
place
in
his
life
gets
to
share
some
backstory
as
to
how
he
got
there
is
involved
in
all
the
major
events
of
the
movie
while
having
a
semi-working
understanding
of
whats
at
stake
and
why
its
important
someone
who
does
care
about
the
wellbeing
of
naboo
but
all
this
jediadventuring
stuff
is
new
to
him
someone
who
needs
things
explained
to
him
occasionally
and
has
the
arc
of
going
from
a
clumsy
out-of-luck
outcast
to
a
hero
.
the
protagonist
of
episode
one
is
jar
jar
binks
.
alex
lee
holy
shit
youre
right
.
alex
lee
i
have
to
wonder
why
not
one
ship
in
orbit
is
firing
from
the
sky
to
rain
death
on
the
gungan
army
.
itd
be
like
setting
ants
on
fire
.
what
was
the
point
of
deploying
an
army
to
stop
the
gungas
if
they
could
do
that
its
not
like
all
the
ships
were
trying
to
defend
the
droid
control
ship
because
the
key
ship
is
left
alone
.
tapewormbike
i
also
always
wondered
where
did
the
gungoons
get
all
their
war
equipment
since
it
clearly
was
designed
for
on
ground
warfare
while
the
gungitos
are
underwater
creatures
yes
it
looked
shell
like
but
they
rode
bipedal
creatures
and
had
freaking
catapults
.
so
either
the
gung
show
have
like
a
stash
of
stuff
on
the
mainland
or
they
had
to
drag
all
of
it
from
the
bottom
of
the
lake
where
they
keep
it
in
case
someone
attacks
the
land
and
they
decide
to
defend
it
thus
blowing
their
cover
themselves
.
tapewormbike
i
agree
and
it
probably
at
some
stage
was
totally
intentional
since
lucas
was
all
about
the
seeing
the
big
drama
through
eyes
of
a
small
pawn
stuff
.
since
c3p0
and
r2d2
were
just
that
in
previous
movies
including
them
made
that
intention
very
very
muddy
.
that
being
said
of
course
the
execution
of
that
idea..well
executed
that
idea
.
just
as
with
other
characters
for
example
the
ideally
terrifiying
enemy
who
truly
represents
how
powerful
and
thus
seductive
the
dark
side
is
only
to
show
us
the
tragedy
of
selfish
lust
for
power
count
dooku
who
i
usually
forget
even
is
in
the
third
movie
.
mike
calls
lucas
a
simpleton
quite
often
but
what
he
truly
is
is
a
child
.
richie
rich
who
got
lucky
when
his
imaginative
pretend
play
gripped
attention
of
other
children
and
was
then
handled
by
adults
a
literal
father
figure
lucas
teacher
irvin
kershner
and
others
.
when
nobody
opposed
him
he
just
sat
in
the
corner
with
his
action
figures
went
pew
pew
pew
and
people
paid
millions
to
watch
the
sexless
preteen
idea
of
a
tragedy
.
boodomi
the
sad
truth
is
that
phantom
menace
is
the
best
of
the
prequels
.
im
sorry
im
so
sorry
.
marvin
falz
no
need
to
feel
sorry
in
my
case
.
ive
stopped
caring
about
the
prequels
a
long
time
ago
.

.
manctofu
i
think
ive
identified
the
most
ludicrous
part
of
this
comment
comparing
characters
to
planets
.
you
seriously
think
planets
should
be
able
to
be
described
as
richly
as
characters
you
are
utterly
clueless
.
the
review
explains
the
importance
of
a
protagonist
by
referencing
some
of
the
greatest
films
ever
made
.
manctofu
people
criticising
these
reviews
by
stating
that
the
original
movies
also
had
plot
holes
have
missed
the
point
.
the
point
is
that
plot
holes
can
be
forgotten
or
skimmed
over
if
the
characters
and
story
are
engaging
enough
.
when
characters
are
sitting
around
spouting
boring
political
dialogue
that
doesnt
make
sense
jumping
around
in
perfectly-choregraphed
fight
scenes
or
fighting
with
utterly
pointless
enemies
that
present
no
threat
whatsoever
then
the
tension
is
removed
.
if
the
tension
is
removed
the
problems
with
the
plot
come
into
sharper
focus
.
after
that
it
gets
harder
and
harder
to
ignore
them
.
coupled
with
stupid
dialogue
stupid
characters
and
stupid
action
the
problems
compound
until
its
just
one
big
mess
yes
ive
paraphrased
plinkett
there
.
on
a
separate
note
reading
the
imdb
message
boards
its
become
clear
to
me
that
plot
hole
is
something
people
say
when
they
mean
something
i
dont
like
about
the
movie
but
want
to
sound
more
clever
.
true
star
wars
fan
i
wonder
if
lucas
has
even
seen
these
reviews
cause
all
the
prequals
are
absolute
shit
s.a.w
the
guy
who
did
this
review
is
a
idiot
.
yes
they
are
not
as
good
as
the
first
3
but
it
all
ties
into
one
overall
story
.
you
can
rip
apart
any
movie
.
to
the
guy
doing
the
review
move
out
of
you
moms
basement
and
get
a
real
job
and
stop
ripping
things
apart
because
its
cooler
then
yourself
.
john
mcmillan
plinketts
point
was
that
having
a
clear
and
relatable
protagonist
in
the
beginning
of
the
movie
works
very
well
in
the
sci
fi
and
fantasy
genres
which
is
vastly
different
from
paradise
lost
.
i
think
george
intended
for
anakin
to
be
the
protagonist
but
by
the
point
he
appears
weve
lost
all
interest
in
any
of
the
characters
plights
.
michael
roper
i
remember
going
to
taco
bell
to
play
their
star
wars
version
of
the
monopoly
with
my
family
.
then
we
went
to
watch
the
film
.
i
was
too
young
at
the
time
to
really
stop
and
think
about
what
was
going
on
during
the
film
.
just
flashing
colors
that
kept
me
quiet
i
guess
.

i
know
that
the
thing

really
do
not

hard

people
need
to
quit
taking
this
so
seriously
i
tapewormbike
i
would
like
to
have
jake
lloyds
commentary
because
i
know
he
grew
up
to
be
a
kinda
funny
cynical
bastard
honestly
i
am
amazed
he
did
not
murder
children
in
his
twenties
startreksucks
the
phantom
menace
just
lookslike
some
amateurs
impression
of
what
a
star
wars
prequel
would
look
like
.
qui-gon
the
slightly
younger
ben
kenobi
anakin
a
7-year
old
luke
padme
a
princess
leia
still
on
alderaan
before
going
on
the
death
star
obi-wan
what
anakin
skywalker
might
lookedbeen
like
darth
maul
vader
beforewithout
the
mask
and
helmet
darth
sidious
the
emperor
before
stardom
and
fame
whats
worst
too
is
that
the
name
the
phantom
menace
implies
that
theres
some
sort
of
force
ghost
menace
or
something
like
that
.
it
also
makes
it
look
like
lucas
is
calling
the
original
trilogy
some
sort
of
menace
and
the
fact
that
its
a
prequel
shows
lucas
desperation
to
erase
that
memory
by
smearing
darth
mauls
stupid
facepaint
all
over
the
images
of
the
originals
.
fuckstick
dork
as
in

or
dork
as
in

bannef
this
was
the
first
star
wars
movie
i
ever
saw
.
i
was
only
half
watching
it
because
i
was
at
a
friends
house
and
i
assumed
that
was
why
i
didnt
understand
what
was
going
on
.
i
was
wrong
.
tomz
what
is
it
with
ricks
thanatos2k
the
real
reason
the
bet
makes
no
sense
whatsoever
is
that
qui
gon
booze
adds
the
pod
as
a
bet
against
anakin
as
if
he
would
give
the
pod
to
watto
if
he
lost
.
but
that
makes
no
sense
as
pretty
much
every
pod
that
loses
the
race
is
completely
destroyed
.
seriously
do
any
of
them
besides
anakin
make
it
to
the
finish
line
what
was
watto
going
to
win
again
if
anakin
lost
the
race
and
likely
would
die
in
the
horrible
explosion
thanatos2k
worf
the
moons
gravitational
field
obscured
our
hyperspace
signature
.
the
trade
federation
did
not
detect
us
nem
im
ashamed
to
say
it
took
me
until
a
week
ago
to
realize
jake
llyod
was
mispronouncing
coruscant
because
he
learned
it
through
text..
mr.
dreadnought
cockring
never
stop
squeezing
those
gats
plinkett
.
marvin
falz
okay
so
i
said
that
i
dont
care
about
the
prequels
anymore
.
but
im
still
disgusted
whenever
i
discover
another
rhyme
.
vader
tells
tarkin
that
he
is
here
.
tarkin
believes
that
obi-wan
surely
he
must
be
dead
by
now
.
my
eyes
are
rolling
.
im
beginning
to
believe
that
they
must
be
dead
by
now
.
destroy
whats
left
of
them
became
the
work
motto
for
the
productions
of
attack
of
the
clones
and
revenge
of
the
sith
.
lucky
for
us
that
the
real
and
only
star
wars
saga
is
holy
and
immortal
and
its
purity
being
protected
by
its
fans
.
alex
lee
seeing
as
how
lucas
called
the
gungans
goongas
mispronoucing
that
word
doesnt
seem
to
matter
really
.
annie
stone
i
really
loved
all
the
prequels
so
much
more
than
the
old
star
wars
movies
because
they
were
old
and
now
the
prequels
are
starting
to
get
old
so
i
dont
like
them
that
much
any
more
.
admiral
bone-to-pick
yeah
but
like
the
phantom
menace
paradise
lost
is
totally
convoluted
and
confusing
and
doesnt
make
a
lot
of
sense
.
if
the
phrase
plot
holes
had
existed
in
the
seventeenth
century
then
someone
like
plinkett
would
probably
have
printed
lengthy
pamphlets
on
the
subject
.
marc
magana
youre
getting
old
too
.
erin
d
lindsey
i
like
these
videos
because
i
think
they
not
only
demonstrate
that
the
prequels
story
and
characters
were
inferior
to
the
original
trilogy
but
that
the
prequels
were
inferior
on
a
technical
and
directorial
level
as
well
.
i
think
they
help
people
who
may
have
had
difficulty
verbalizing
exactly
why
they
didnt
like
the
prequels
as
much
as
opposed
to
they
just
sucked
.
erin
d
lindsey
also
pizza
rolls
.
alex
lee
i
know
what
you
mean
.
when
i
was
reading
book
3
i
kept
thinking
to
myself
god
who
do
you
think
you
are
palpatine
hansbricks
that
is
the
stupidest
reason
to
not
like
a
movie
i
have
ever
heard
in
my
entire
life
.
im
serious
.
yeah
i
liked
ninja
turtles
but
theyre
about
a
year
old
now
so
i
dont
like
them
anymore
.
come
back
when
you
have
a
good
reason
.
jhea
at
least
the
way
they
are
done
.
mr
plinkett
gives
some
advices
on
how
to
do
it
better
.
best
one
i
remember
was
from
episode
3
with
the
clonetroopers
and
the
foodlines
giving
us
a
picture
on
how
the
war
is
ravaging
the
galaxy
etc
.
yezzir
people
who
alter
or
destroy
works
of
art
and
cultural
heritage
for
profit
or
as
an
exercise
of
power
are
barbarians
.
george
lucas
1988
tapewormbike
maybe
just
saying
george
as
opposed
to
paul
actually
is
dead
and
was
replaced
by
a
heartless
bastard
sometime
in
the
late
80s
early
90s
.
culture
vulture
a
week
ago
i
went
on
the
official
star
wars
wikipedia
and
added
a
little
bit
to
the
episode
i
page
mentioning
this
review
.
unfortunately
they
got
rid
of
my
addition
because
the
felt
that
it
contributed
nothing
to
peoples
understanding
of
the
critical
reception
of
the
movie..
but
somehow
all
of
the
misguided
praise
of
episode
i
did
contribute
to
peoples
understanding..
some
fanboys
are
a
little
hurt
it
seems..

thehaggishunter
its
better
to
get
half
in
the
bag
often
than
wait
6
months
for
a
plinkett
review
sir
christopher
mcfarlane
this
movie
may
be
among
the
worst
but
its
not
school
bad
.
alex
lee
i
found
yet
another
way
this
movie
fails
.
so
i
was
watching
gamesters
of
triskelion
and
i
saw
another
way
episode
i
fails
.
in
that
episode
kirk
uhura
and
chekov
are
enslaved
and
are
forced
to
wear
shock
collars
to
fight
as
gladiators
.
even
star
trek
a
show
that
spent
about
30
dollars
on
wardrobe
handled
the
whole
enslavement
thing
better
than
the
exploding
chip
in
a
multimillion
dollar
production
.
alex
lee
sir
theyve
gone
up
the
ventilation
shaft
cant
you
just
start
pumping
in
gas
you
know
like
what
you
did
with
the
ventilation
shafts
in
the
conference
room
doesnt
the
thing
with
the
mouth
face
have
any
initiative
kwisatz
haderach
or
maybe
with
a
lot
of
help
from
michael
arndt
and
lawrence
kasdan
hell
make
a
great
film
that
will
restore
the
franchise
to
its
former
glory
.
hey
lets
keep
a
little
optimism
here
dollar
store
cashier
wife
the
only
thing
that
im
absolutely
sure
that
will
be
good
is
williams
score.i
mean
he
managed
to
create
amazing
music
even
when
his
inspiration
was
the
utter
shite
that
is
the
prequels
.
kirk
clarke
i
personally
think
its
a
clever
title
the
darkside
is
a
dangerous
quality
that
disappeared
for
a
long
time
which
cant
not
exist
because
it
is
always
possible
to
fall
down
that
dark
path
.
just
because
the
title
has
phantom
or
ghost
in
the
title
doesnt
imply
there
should
be
ghosts
in
the
story
.
the
threatening
quality
i.e
.
the
darkside
can
be
like
a
ghost
.
also
darth
maul
is
exactly
what
the
jedi
have
been
expecting
because
of
what
he
represents
.
thats
probably
why
his
face
was
shown
.
zack
tisdale
obvious
troll
is
obvious

http
very
good
point
forever
i
dont
know
if
they
knew
this
while
making
these
but
lucas
originally
wanted
to
call
the
nemoidians
shatnarians
bringmeknitting
well
i
know
one
thing
i
find
the
plinkett
reviews
far
more
entertaining
and
satisfying
than
the
prequels
themselves
.
george
lucas
.
came
up
with
two
great
ideas
and
initially
two
great
trilogies
.
should
have
then
retired
and
left
well
alone
.
actually
i
was
half-expecting
the
prequels
to
be
disappointing
its
all
the
screwing
about
with
the
original
trilogy
that
i
find
truly
offensive
.
which
lucas
then
compounds
by
insulting
all
the
millions
who
loved
the
original
films
by
saying
sorry
you
liked
my
incomplete
vision
or
some
such
patronising
bollocks
okay
yes
i
shouldnt
care
and
i
can
ignore
the
prequels
but
it
seems
im
not
even
allowed
to
enjoy
the
original
films
as
they
were
anymore
.
its
like
floyd
changing
dark
side
of
the
moon
or
the
beatles
changing
revolver
.
or
if
you
dont
like
those
records
pick
a
classic
album
you
love
as
applicable
canadian
guy
you
totally
ruined
this
masterpiece

the
phantom
menace
review
is
one
of
the
finest
critiques
of
a
movie
ever
done
.
it
is
a
masterpiece
.
it
is
undeniably
more
entertaining
than
the
prequels
most
science

movies
and
the
vast
majority
of

generally

its

for

i
struggled
through
a
living
hell
of
emotional

and
self-depreciation
and
had
no
one
to
voice
my
emotional
suffering

red

took

weight
off

picked

up
off

floor
and
showed
me
a

a
world
that
made
sense
of
the
senseless
crimes
of
george

.
jack
brown
describe
qui-gon
jinn
in
using
your
pre-requisites
he
is
someone
who
is
at
a
constant
struggle
with
himself
.
he
agrees
with
the
principles
of
his
faith
and
is
loyal
to
it
but
also
goes
against
its
restrictions
.
someone
who
sees
what
has
to
be
done
and
simply
does
it
.
if
theres
consequences
later
hell
accept
them
but
he
got
the
job
done
.
kind
at
heart
empathising
with
those
around
him
and
a
guiding
father-figure
to
obi-wan
he
is
the
master
youd
come
to
for
advice
or
help
.
for
the
record
the
description
your
video
gave
of
han
solo
was
very
weak
.
he
is
a
great
character
and
they
could
have
came
up
with
more
than
scoundrel
good-looking
and
kind
at
heart
i
love
all
the
star
wars
movies
prequels
included
as
we
saw
the
originals
that
introduced
us
to
the
world
and
its
rules
with
references
to
the
events
of
the
past
.
this
meant
that
essentially
there
couldnt
be
as
much
drama
as
we
knew
how
the
prequels
would
play
out
.
we
knew
the
emperor
would
take
over
and
form
the
empire
.
you
watch
the
prequels
to
se
just
how
that
unfolds
.
as
for
who
is
the
main
character
id
say
obi-wan
.
we
dont
experience
it
through
his
perspective
as
its
more
of
a
third-person
movie
but
obi-wan
has
encounters
with
everyone
else
and
even
emotional
reactions
with
them
.
as
a
jedi
he
doesnt
cant
throw
out
tears
but
shows
concern
out
his
master
defying
the
council
ob-wan
is
a
by-the-book
jedi
but
also
loyalty
as
he
cares
deeply
for
his
master
seen
in
the
end
when
jinn
dies
and
obi-wan
gets
mad
and
avenges
him
in
what
may
be
the
best
dual
of
the
series
he
is
worried
about
anakin
trusting
the
councils
view
that
he
is
dangerous
but
ultimately
deciding
to
train
him
because
it
was
jinns
last
request
.
this
shows
an
arc
as
its
the
first
time
obi-wan
has
been
willing
to
defy
the
council
and
with
the
knowledge
of
the
originals
we
know
the
mistake
that
it
is
to
train
him
and
that
hell
be
the
death
of
the
jedi
so
we
are
seeing
the
beginning
of
the
end
.
by
the
way
i
dont
get
the
retarded
voice
in
the
video
that
i
hope
is
an
act
for
the
video
and
the
mispronunciation
of
protagonist
.
i
work
in
filmtv
as
an
editor
and
have
my
degree
in
screen
arts
and
while
i
can
say
your
basic
formula
does
suit
sic-fi
and
fantasy
best
as
we
need
a
relatable
character
to
guide
us
through
it
is
not
essential
.
as
long
as
the
rules
of
the
world
are
clearly
established
as
they
were
with
the
originalsopening
titlesopening
scene
then
we
have
a
context
to
put
these
character
into
.

alex
lee
im
going
to
treat
this
comment
as
if
it
isnt
trolling
for
the
sake
of
argument
.
obi-wan
doesnt
do
anything
in
this
movie
though
.
hes
in
the
background
following
orders
and
that
means
he
cant
be
the
main
character
in
this
story
because
he
isnt
really
interacting
with
other
characters
qui-gonn
does
.
qui-gonns
the
one
that
makes
the
plans
makes
suggestions
and
performs
most
of
the
actions-especially
when
it
comes
to
anakin-in
the
movie
.
obi-wan
does
none
of
these
things
and
he
barely
reacts
to
the
world
around
him
because
hes
on
the
ship
or
driving
the
submarine
or
something
.
theres
also
the
fact
that
qui-gonn
gets
the
most
screen
time
of
any
character
in
the
movie
.
now
i
get
the
feeling
that
lucas
was
writing
a
sanjuro
character
.
for
those
who
never
saw
yojimbo
or
sanjuro
this
character
was
a
bearded
conniving
master
swordsman
who
was
secretive
about
his
feelings
and
helped
the
weak
in
a
weird
and
roundabout
way
.
the
reason
why
sanjuro
works
but
qui-gonn
doesnt
is
that
the
use
of
the
term
knight
implies
nobility
honesty
and
forthrightedness
.
this
problem
is
further
compounded
by
the
inherent
duality
of
the
star
wars
universe
where
good
and
evil
are
pretty
clearly
defined
.
in
contrast
yojimbo
and
sanjuro
are
a
little
bit
fuzzier
on
the
subject
and
certainly
wasnt
one
of
the
main
themes
of
those
movies
anyway
.

jason
by
the
way
i
dont
get
the
retarded
voice
in
the
video
that
i
hope
is
an
act
for
the
video
and
the
mispronunciation
of
protagonist
.
proving
that
the
only
people
who
enjoy
the
prequels
are
mental
infants
.
he
is
someone
who
is
at
a
constant
struggle
with
himself
.
what
when
he
just
seems
to
do
whatever
he
wants
with
a
completely
blasã
attitude
.
if
theres
an
internal
struggle
it
is
at
no
point
shown
in
the
movie
.
the
only
character
trait
the
movie
really
gives
ginny
is
that
he
likes
to
take
the
easy
way
out
whenever
possible
whether
its
mind-tricking
someone
into
giving
him
an
underwater
craft
or
using
the
force
to
cheat
on
a
dice
roll
.
even
when
he
fights
darth
maul
it
comes
off
not
as
an
act
of
courage
but
as
an
act
of
hubrishe
doesnt
think
he
can
lose
and
if
he
actually
thought
for
a
second
he
might
lose
hed
have
probably
mind-tricked
someone
else
into
fighting
for
him
.
if
anything
ginny
acts
more
like
a
sith
than
a
jedi
manipulating
people
and
situations
to
his
personal
advantage
which
btw
wouldve
been
a
much
more
interesting
and
subtle
character
arc
than
anything
in
the
prequels
.
dudley
hey
come
on
now
.
i
dont
agree
with
the
guy
but
thats
harsh
.
dudley
i
hadnt
watched
this
in
a
long
time
and
rewatching
it
now
its
amazing
how
much
this
a
criticism
of
a
movie
holds
up
as
entertainment
.
certainly
more
so
than
the
soporific
prequels
.
one
aspect
in
which
id
disagree
from
plinkett
is
in
the
idea
that
these
movies
have
ruined
star
wars
.
i
still
like
those
movies
the
original
ones
about
as
much
now
as
i
did
before
the
phantom
menace
existed
.
actually
i
might
appreciate
them
more
now
then
i
did
then
.
but
thats
just
personal
experience
.

oh
wait
you
were
serious
you
work
in
film
and
tv
and
have
a
degree
in
screen
arts
you
deserve
a
refund
my
friend
your
time
in
class
was
wasted
if
you
think
this
things
qualify
in
anyway
as
films
.
you
are
actually
arguing
that
this
movie
was
better
off
without
a
relateable
character
and
claim
that
there
is
some
context
to
this
collection
of
images
and
sound
effects
meant
to
capitalize
on
more
successful
stories
.
also
you
are
dead
wrong
people
didnt
come
to
the
prequels
to
watch
the
story
unfold
.
they
came
for
the
same
reason
we
went
to
see
the
original
films
to
be
entertained
and
in
hopes
that
the
interesting
world
lucas
created
could
be
expanded
.
if
you
just
wanted
to
see
how
the
story
unfolded
all
you
needed
to
do
was
listen
to
old
obi
wan
in
star
wars
and
return
of
the
jedi
.
because
like
it
or
not
guest
these
movies
were
not
about
obi
wan
they
are
about
darth
vader
.
period
.
the
whole
point
of
these
films
was
to
show
vader
being
created
.
everything
else
is
a
slapped
on
plot
device
to
get
to
tatooine
pick
up
anakin
and
make
him
into
vader
.
this
was
a
total
and
complete
failure
of
a
film
.
the
following
two
movies
were
just
as
bad
.
heres
what
i
think
you
are
somewhere
around
20
25
years
old
and
were
a
child
when
these
films
came
out
.
you
were
just
old
enough
to
be
amazed
by
the
lightsabers
and
blasters
and
over
the
next
six
years
you
convinced
yourself
that
this
was
your
generations
epic
films
.
star
wars
was
ground
breaking
.
empire
is
the
basis
by
which
all
sequels
would
forever
be
judged
.
jedi
was
okay
but
at
least
tied
together
the
acts
of
the
story
.
you
defend
this
film
because
as
a
child
raised
in
the
area
of
big
explosions
lazy
writing
and
rip
offs
of
other
films
for
the
sake
of
name
recognition
you
have
no
concept
of
what
the
made
the
star
wars
films
the
hits
they
were
.
if
you
are
involved
in
the
editing
of
anything
on
tv
i
sincerely
doubt
that
it
is
anything
more
substantive
than
jerry
springer
or
survivor
.
please
do
the
world
a
favor
and
never
become
a
movie
critic
your
input
will
only
hinder
not
help
.
by
the
way
its
clear
by
your
comments
that
you
are
incapable
of
understanding
humor
.
as
well
as
being
jealous
of
the
originality
these
guys
showed
by
creating
a
character
like
plinkett
.
only
children
and
trolls
feel
the
need
to
post
their
resumes
in
a
comment
section
to
try
and
add
validity
to
their
point
.
well
children
trolls
and
people
who
only
have
a
casual
acquaintanceship
with
the
truth
.
john
orr
my
favorite
sw
film
actually
.
ident
i
dont
think
he
said
the
prequels
ruined
the
original
trilogy
.
he
said
the
prequels
ruined
some
concepts
within
the
star
wars
universe
e.g
.
the
coolness
of
light
sabers
.
im
not
going
to
argue
whether
they
did
or
didnt
just
clarifying
.
ident
please
tell
me
he
had
moisture
vaporators
on
that
farm
.
ident
agreed
.
put
simply
obi-wan
lacks
agency
.
hes
a
subordinate
he
followed
orders
he
took
little
to
no
initiative
.
i
cant
imagine
a
reasonable
argument
for
him
to
be
the
protagonist
.
and
the
idea
that
obi-wan
had
some
kind
of
renegade
arc
from
by-the-book
to
defying
the
council
is
undermined
by
the
fact
that
obi-wan
was
an
apprentice
still
in
training
thus
calling
him
a
by-the-book
jedi
is
misleading
since
he
hasnt
finished
learning
the
book
and
the
fact
that
he
participated
without
protest
in
the
force
manipulation
of
boss
nass
at
the
beginning
of
the
movie
demonstrating
that
he
is
ethically
lacking
from
the
start
.
bort
ive
been
wondering
what
are
midi-chlorians
well
they
are
one
of
the
many
things
that
ruin
star
wars
.
âi
dont
like
sand
.
its
coarse
and
rough
and
irritating
and
it
gets
everywhere.â
aww
i
understand
darth..
is
that
why
you
turned
to
the
dark
side
anakin
are
you
an
angel
padme
what
anakin
an
angel
.
ive
heard
the
deep
space
pilots
talk
about
them
.
they
live
on
the
moons
of
lego
i
think
.
theyre
the
excuse
me
miss
um
can
i
get
a
refund
on
this
ticket
.
im
going
home
now
canadian
guy
his
soul
evaporated
on
that
farm
.
does
that
count
duckler
the
prequels
never
existed
so
the
original
trilogy
is
intact
.
guest
lol
bort
hey
jabba
ya
do
realize
that
you
actually
look
like
turd
right
nathan
david
haslett
as
a
sith
he
is
weaker
because
the
whole
robot
thing
.
flesh
is
much
more
useful
and
efficient
in
wielding
the
force
than
machinery
.
very
simple
answer
.
also
tfu
game
was
specifically
a
grandiose
portrayal
of
force
powers
showing
them
as
way
more
destructing
and
powerful
than
they
are
.
you
can
see
that
by
seeing
what
vader
can
do
in
game
compared
to
out
of
it
.
nathan
david
haslett
the
movie
has
obi-wan
straight
up
say
to
qui
gon
something
like
youd
be
a
master
by
now
if
you
ever
actually
listened
to
them
.
so
movie
does
state
it
.
nathan
david
haslett
in
1
she
is
14
and
he
is
10.
in
2
she
is
24
and
he
is
20.
for
her
age
is
exact
for
him
it
is
rough
because
he
was
like
910
in
the
first
.
age
difference
is
5
years
but
ya
still
a
bigger
one
than
it
seemed
in
2
.
drew
burge
guest
im
so
confident
in
my
opinion
and
resume
i
threw
together
this
misspelled
slop
and
posted
as
a
guest
cockpuppet
.
also
youre
a
twat
for
saying
retarded
as
a
pejorative
.
oh
and
for
not
recognizing
obvious
jokes
.
fuckstick
this
meant
that
essentially
there
couldnt
be
as
much
drama
as
we
knew
how
the
prequels
would
play
out
.
we
knew
the
emperor
would
take
over
and
form
the
empire
.
you
watch
the
prequels
to
se
just
how
that
unfolds
.
just
like
there
couldnt
be
much
drama
in
a
movie
called
titanic
because
we
knew
how
the
story
would
play
out
.
we
knew
the
boat
would
hit
an
iceberg
and
sink
into
the
sea
with
most
of
its
passengers
.
oh
wait
.
you
see
there
is
a
genre
called
tragedy
in
which
the
audience
usually
knows
ahead
of
time
what
kind
of
tragic
event
is
going
to
occur
but
the
story
is
still
worth
the
telling
because
of
how
the
characters
are
written
and
portrayed
.
to
see
just
how
that
unfolds
are
the
prequels
documentaries
i
guess
they
could
have
been
they
were
about
as
exciting
as
documentaries
.
they
should
have
had
werner
hertzog
narrate
them
the
phantom
menace
the
story
of
how
a
young
film
maker
was
devoured
by
a
flannel
bear
.
tapewormbike
i
have
no
idea
about
these
prequeefs
you
keep
mentioning
.
jonathan
martinez
fuck
this
guy
i
can
bash
the
original
trilogy
even
harder
for
example
when
luke
is
flying
in
the
fuckin
x
wing
all
his
squadron
dies
by
receiving
instant
hits
by
darth
varders
ship
yet
darth
vader
cant
land
a
damn
hit
on
luke
and
talk
about
flaws
in
the
design
of
the
death
star
.
1
little
lazer
can
destroy
the
whole
thing
i
mean
through
that
little
hole
why
not
cover
it
up
.
heck
if
i
built
a
death
star
id
for
sure
cover
that
damn
hole
.
and
what
about
the
fuckin
clone
troopers
their
so
goddamn
stupid
bumping
their
heads
onto
doors
n
shit
and
howww
are
they
gon
na
lose
the
battle
at
endor
against
those
little
creatures
and
you
think
im
gon
na
believe
that
leia
luke
and
han
can
handle
like
the
whole
clone
army
naaaa
fuck
this
guyy
.
tapewormbike
bro
do
you
even
like
compelling
characters
and
actual
emotions
bro
valou999
you
could
try
and
bash
the
original
assuming
you
come
up
with
legitimately
good
points
which
you
really
dont
otherwise
youd
only
like
an
idiot
which
you
totally
do
.
yet
darth
vader
cant
land
a
damn
hit
on
luke
luke
is
protected
by
the
force
vader
even
makes
a
comment
about
it
1
little
lazer
can
destroy
the
whole
thing
not
lasers
torpedoes
.
one
tiny
spark
can
create
great
catastrophies
its
called
a
chain
reaction
.
heck
if
i
built
a
death
star
id
for
sure
cover
that
damn
hole
.
even
the
best
architectural
structures
have
flaws
.
its
something
that
was
clearly
overlooked
when
designed
and
even
then
they
were
too
overconfident
and
never
imagined
anyone
would
attempt
this
sort
of
attack
against
a
seemingly
undefeatable
battle
station
.
the
death
star
has
defenses
adapted
to
fight
off
the
sort
of
things
that
could
actually
cause
damage
to
it
like
large
capital
ships
and
other
.
small
fighters
are
like
mosquitos
to
it
who
wouldve
thought
they
could
be
any
threat
at
all
and
the
grand
scheme
of
things
its
only
after
they
assessed
the
rebels
attack
that
they
recognized
the
flaw
in
the
design
and
got
worried
to
the
point
of
wanting
to
evacute
.
they
didnt
know
about
it
beforehand
and
its
safe
to
assume
the
hole
had
some
other
purpose
to
begin
with
also
what
about
the
fuckin
clone
troopers
their
so
goddamn
stupid
as
opposed
to
the
completely
useless
and
equally
stupid
droids
of
the
prequels
or
any
opposing
army
force
in
any
movie
ever
made
if
they
were
realistically
competent
the
heroes
would
die
in
2
seconds
and
there
would
be
no
movie
.
howww
are
they
gon
na
lose
the
battle
at
endor
against
those
little
creature
the
same
way
the
american
forces
lost
in
vietnam
.
http
exhaust
vents
are
a
pretty
basic
part
of
engineering
and
you
wouldnt
want
to
cover
those
up
.

when
you
diss
the
original
trilogy
you
diss
yourself
.
http
pretty
true
.
although
lucas
believes
that
america
lost
to
the
ingenuity
of
the
north
vietnamese
and
reflected
that
with
the
ewoks
.
the
real
problem
is
that
america
fought
the
war
on
the
enemys
terms
.
instead
of
targeting
the
enemys
infrastructure
and
bombing
the
railways
munitions
dumps
etc
we
just
had
american
soldiers
wandering
around
the
forest
getting
ambushed
and
killed
much
like
the
stormtroopers
.
while
lucas
may
believe
that
victory
was
due
to
the
viet
kongs
ingenuity
it
was
actually
the
result
of
americas
incredible
stupidity
.
lbj
and
macnamera
should
burn
in
hell
for
how
they
ineptly
dragged
that
war
out
just
to
profit
off
the
soldiers
.
elcamino
the
weird
thing
is
that
keira
knightley
was
cast
as
one
of
queen
hotpantspadmes
decoys
.
jonathan
martinez
luke
is
protected
by
the
force
and
that
totally
compensates
the
fact
that
he
is
a
new
pilot
so
he
gets
a
special
shield
right
i
dont
think
thats
how
the
force
works
.
plo
koon
got
taken
down
while
he
was
flying
and
he
is
strong
with
the
force
and
it
was
a
damn
clone
who
took
him
down
.
the
damn
torpedos
look
like
slow
moving
lazers
-_-
.
about
the
death
star
what
is
this
the
twenty
first
century
such
structures
should
be
extremely
formidable
and
not
having
direct
acces
to
the
core
.
sure
the
other
ships
are
like
mosquitos
so
they
didnt
worry
but
if
you
built
such
a
huge
thing
protecting
the
interior
is
the
first
thing
you
do
.
about
the
droids
some
droids
do
pose
a
threat
maybe
not
towards
jedi
but
towards
others
yea
and
a
lot
.
the
clone
troopers
in
the
originals
arent
a
threat
to
absolutely
no
one
.
the
guy
that
made
this
review
is
expecting
realism
from
the
movie
.
what
if
we
expected
realism
from
the
originals
than
we
got
a
problem
so
fuck
the
guy
who
made
the
review
.
ultimately
this
is
a
matter
of
when
was
star
wars
a
part
of
your
childhood
for
me
the
prequels
were
a
part
of
my
childhood
.
jonathan
martinez
lol
exhaust
vents
for
that
particular
generator
is
the
death
star
powered
by
combustion
chambers
by
fuel
alberto
the
star
wars
prequels
were
also
part
of
my
childhood
.
i
loved
the
phantom
menace
when
i
was
a
kid
and
looked
forward
enormously
to
episodes
ii
and
iii
.
seeing
the
film
opened
the
door
to
the
rest
of
the
rest
of
the
trilogy
and
other
films
in
general
.
i
still
watch
the
six
movies
regularly
and
enjoy
doing
so
but
at
the
same
time
i
find
the
original
trilogy
much
more
involving
and
compelling
.
the
use
of
practical
effects
and
real
life
sets
plays
a
role
in
making
it
feel
more
real
and
immediate
but
the
overall
development
of
the
story
characters
and
dialogue
are
a
much
more
significant
factor
.
it
isnt
so
much
that
they
are
complex
and
completely
plausible
human
beings
but
that
we
relate
to
their
motivations
.
escaping
from
ones
own
place
of
origin
and
overcoming
an
overwhelming
tyrannical
force
is
a
recurrent
theme
in
lucass
work
visible
in
the
two
non-star
wars
features
lucas
directed
.
there
are
traces
of
it
in
the
prequels
in
the
character
of
anakin
skywalker
but
lucas
shot
himself
in
the
foot
by
deliberately
invoking
a
world
that
isnt
as
black
and
white
in
its
morality
.
i
have
constantly
tried
to
relate
to
anakins
transformation
and
find
it
compelling
in
theory
much
less
so
in
execution
.
his
filmss
reliance
on
cgi
create
vast
and
pretty
landscapes
but
dont
have
the
same
dramatic
effect
as
the
use
of
lighting
more
this
effect
is
more
limited
.
it
ultimately
boils
down
to
ones
own
opinions
and
the
arguments
they
defend
them
with
.
a
good
case
could
be
made
in
favor
of
the
prequels
as
well
as
a
case
against
the
original
trilogy
though
i
havent
found
a
wholly
convincing
one
yet
.
becoming
irate
because
the
death
star
has
a
vulnerable
point
or
because
lukes
ship
is
never
taken
down
is
nitpicking
and
arent
valid
reasons
to
take
down
an
entire
film
.
they
are
well
known
narrative
tropes
from
the
genres
that
inspired
lucas
to
write
the
film
in
the
first
place
.
of
course
luke
isnt
going
to
get
shot
down
hes
the
main
character
and
unless
the
death
star
is
powered
by
some
sort
of
perpetual
motion
machine
which
is
impossible
in
practical
scientific
terms
it
needs
some
sort
of
fuel
to
operate
.
there
are
great
films
that
have
small
inconsistencies
if
not
outright
plot
holes
.
plinkett
does
his
fair
share
of
nitpicking
and
pointing
out
inconsistencies
but
his
overall
argument
is
the
same
that
the
film
doesnt
evoke
the
same
emotional
connection
that
the
original
films
did
.
if
you
really
like
the
prequels
this
may
not
change
your
mind
and
i
dont
want
to
.
but
keep
in
mind
that
the
point
of
this
kind
of
analytical
exercise
and
any
review
in
general
is
not
to
change
your
opinion
but
to
exhibit
the
authors
opinion
and
hope
it
encourages
further
reasonable
discussion
on
a
certain
topic
.
so
dont
attack
the
people
expressing
opinions
that
you
disagree
with
and
please
find
a
more
coherent
and
courteous
way
of
expressing
yourself
.
have
a
nice
day
.
http
yeah
like
most
machines
id
figure
it
would
need
some
type
of
fuel
.
and
a
way
to
let
out
the
exhaust
from
said
fuel
.
i
mean
only
a
total
moron
would
have
trouble
grasping
such
a
simple
concept
http
they
were
part
of
my
childhood
too
but
at
least
i
grew
up
and
saw
them
for
what
they
were
.
valou999
hear
hear
alex
lee
you
said
it
brother
.
wait
you
said
that
harry
s.
plinkett
.
alex
lee
the
best
thing
about
the
phantom
menace
is
that
you
can
forget
everything
that
happens
in
it
and
it
wont
affect
the
prequels
in
the
slightest
.
ii
and
iii
are-unfortunately-necessary
to
the
original
trilogy
.
jonathan
martinez
lol
so
the
death
star
is
powered
by
fossil
fuel
no
way
jonathan
martinez
thank
you
for
your
reply
but
you
cant
deny
how
awkward
the
acting
was
in
the
originals
especially
leia
im
not
saying
the
prequels
had
greater
acting
but
they
were
more
serious
making
me
believe
it
was
real
scenarios
.
about
cgi
or
practical
effects
cgi
is
much
better
.
im
just
use
to
modern
films
at
this
point
.
another
point
that
i
hadnt
brought
up
yet
is
the
light
saber
dueling
oh
boy
did
i
cringe
when
i
saw
them
in
the
originals
.
the
best
light
saber
duels
are
all
in
episode
3
and
portraying
the
jedi
and
the
sith
is
imensly
important
for
me
.
jonathan
martinez
sureley
filter
existed
by
than
lol
.
valou999
i
quite
literally
facepalmed
and
groaned
when
you
said
cgi
or
pratical
effects
cgi
is
much
better
.
this
is
where
you
can
truly
see
the
immense
gap
between
the
older
and
the
newer
generation
.
i
then
groaned
even
more
when
you
added
the
best
light
saber
duels
are
all
in
episode
3
.
clearly
all
hope
is
lost
with
the
new
generation
how
is
45
minutes
of
emotionless
and
tedious
choreographed
stunts
pirouettes
and
sword
clashes
even
qualifiy
as
a
good
duel
is
beyond
my
comprehension
.
for
one
it
completely
lacks
grit
due
to
the
cleaness
of
the
choreography
but
more
importantly
any
emotion
build
up
you
had
leading
up
to
this
point
evaporated
after
just
the
first
30
secs
stretching
the
duels
out
for
so
long
is
only
overindulgent
and
completely
useless
as
it
only
serves
to
emotionally
disconnect
you
from
the
characters
and
the
scene
.
the
duels
in
the
originals
were
briefer
and
worked
way
better
for
it
.
the
best
example
is
the
luke
and
vader
duel
at
the
end
of
rotj
.
luke
gets
pissed
and
just
wails
on
a
hapless
vader
.
theres
no
fancy
clean
safe
choreography
here
just
emotion
at
its
purest
.
everything
is
finish
within
a
minute
and
you
got
everything
you
had
to
understand
from
the
characters
from
just
that
.
what
point
did
the
duels
have
in
the
prequels
i
ask
you
.
what
impact
did
the
qui-gonobiwandarth
maul
duel
had
on
any
of
the
characters
none
.
the
obiwananakincount
dooku
duel
besides
someone
losing
an
hand
which
even
that
by
itself
doesnt
lead
up
up
to
anything
of
significance
quite
unlike
lukes
loss
of
his
hand
even
more
nothing
.
the
obiwangrievous
duel
a
brain
aneurysm
maybe
.
youd
think
the
obiwananakin
duel
would
have
some
meaning
but
no
its
just
as
devoided
as
the
others
.
now
watch
the
originals
again
.
a
new
hope
obiwan
sacrifies
himself
and
becomes
a
greater
ally
to
luke
as
a
result
something
that
has
a
lasting
effect
on
the
following
movies
.
esb
luke
is
completely
outclassed
by
vader
.
he
acted
brashly
when
he
shouldve
heed
yodas
wisdom
and
ultimately
paid
the
price
.
he
was
no
help
to
his
firend
and
may
have
in
fact
endangered
them
even
more
by
going
to
bespin
.
harsh
lesson
learned
.
rotj
luke
lashes
out
at
vader
but
after
defeating
him
he
realizes
hes
becoming
like
his
father
clear
parallel
between
his
robotic
hand
and
his
fathers
.
luke
casts
away
his
hate
and
stands
against
the
emeror
as
a
jedi
knight
.
oh
look
character
arc
something
completely
absent
from
the
prequels
.
and
finally
if
you
think
light
saber
duels
portray
the
best
aspect
of
star
wars
the
force
the
jedi
and
the
sith
than
i
think
quite
a
few
things
about
the
movies
went
over
your
head
jonathan
martinez
aa
yes
emotion
the
duels
in
the
originals
had
emotions
.
hmm
are
you
saying
the
prequel
duels
were
emotionless
im
pretty
sure
theyre
not
.
qui-gon
and
obi-wan
against
maul
.
qui-gon
being
who
he
is
relies
heavily
on
strong
attacks
and
adapts
to
a
style
depending
on
the
needs
nevertheless
this
makes
him
predictable
and
vulnerable
.
during
the
events
of
episode
1
he
was
already
past
his
prime
.
on
the
other
hand
darth
maul
uses
bold
precise
and
strong
attacks
.
he
was
sidiouss
personal
assasin
and
had
trained
for
years
this
is
why
he
takes
down
qui-gon
but
is
unsuccesfull
in
taking
down
obi-wan
.
because
obi-wan
knows
his
limits
and
is
also
good
in
determing
the
enemys
limits
.
obi
wan
was
particularly
good
in
blast
deflection
and
also
light
saber
deflection
meaning
he
has
a
good
defense
.
after
a
while
he
takes
down
maul
when
he
catches
him
off
guard
.
because
of
this
and
many
other
things
obi
wan
becomes
one
of
the
greatest
duelist
during
his
time
mace-windu
spoke
highly
of
him
.
the
fight
can
be
easily
viewed
as
the
growth
of
obi-wan
he
is
the
very
same
guy
that
died
to
vader
the
guy
you
mentioned
that
sacrificed
his
life
the
death
of
maul
is
what
makes
him
grow
as
a
jedi
master
emotions
there
are
plenty
maybe
you
must
look
for
them
.
similar
can
be
said
for
the
other
battles
but
i
wont
go
into
detail
.
jonathan
martinez
and
you
should
be
okay
with
the
new
generation
yes
theyre
are
some
individuals
who
just
make
you
lose
all
hope
but
there
are
also
some
very
exception
people
my
age
.

of

i
adore

it
happened
a
long

ago
it
says
so
right
in
the

who
knows
where

dhartm2
you
did
a
terrible
job
of
bashing
the
original
trilogy
harder
than
this
guy
.
you
must
be
very
confused
about
the
definition
of
the
word
harder
because
an
internet
post
on
disqus
that
has
no
likes
isnt
bashing
a
thing
harder
than
a
70
minute
video
thats
been
shared
all
over
the
internet
and
gets
regular
views
daily
.
i
think
you
should
probably
go
back
to
the
workshop
put
a
75
minute
video
together
bashing
the
original
trilogy
posting
that
on
the
internet
and
then
having
your
video
become
more
popular
and
relevant
than
this
one
.
once
you
do
that
i
think
youll
have
succeeded
in
bashing
the
original
trilogy
harder
than
this
guy
.
nine
poorly
written
sentences
just
isnt
going
to
get
it
done

sorry

i
have

silhouetteman
the
fact
that
youre
trying
to
bash
the
original
trilogy
by
listing
a
bunch
of
plot
holes
shows
that
you
have
completely
missed
the
point
of
these
reviews
.
the
point
being
that
the
original
trilogy
is
one
of
the
better
examples
of
classic
meat-and-potatoes
storytelling
in
modern
cinema
while
the
prequel
trilogy
fails
at
storytelling
101
in
nearly
every
way
.
fnertle
its
pretty
fundamental
.
the
original
bashers
are
focusing
on
technical
details
such
as
no
cgi
why
an
exhaust
portal
simplistic
sabre
duels
etc
.
the
difference
and
the
point
clearly
made
in
these
reviews
is
that
the
newer
movies
fail
on
a
fundamental
storytelling
level
.
original
bashers
dont
like
the
color
of
the
cabinets
in
the
kitchen
and
hate
the
dining
room
light
.
new
bashers
are
pointing
out
that
the
windows
leak
there
are
a
few
walls
missing
and
the
foundation
is
cracked
built
on
a
slant
and
is
sinking
into
the
mud
flats
on
which
the
house
is
built
.
but
damn
thats
a
beautiful
bathroom
sink
.
so
shiny
of
course
you
cant
get
to
the
sink
because
of
the
three
toilets
the
electronic
toilet
paper
dispenser
the
chrome
shaving
cream
heater
the
17
spangled

rugs
the
eight
perfectly
formed
ionic
columns
the
low-hanging
chandeliers
there
are
five
and
the
extended
family
of
nubian
ibexes
living
in
the
bathub
.

if
you
use
fuel
to
power
something
whatever
the
fuel
is
there
is
a
waste
product
of
some
type
.
even
in
star
trek
the
undiscovered
country
star
ships
have
emissions
.
that
waste
product
has
to
go
somewhere

in

they
still
have
garbage
chutes
and
trash
compactors
on
the

the
technology
is
fantastic
but
familiar
at
the
same
time

its
also
a
metaphor
in
that
something
so
large
and
imposing
can
be
destroyed
by
a
smaller
ship
with
a
precision
strike

kind
of
related
to
how
a
small
rebel
force
can
lead
to
the
downfall
of
a
massive
evil
empire
isnt
it
those
in
power
become
bloated
complacent
arrogant

you
are
comparing
tiny
completely
irrelevant
nitpicks
to
massive
gaping
flaws
with
the

its
just
not

at
all

the
acting
was
far
worse
in

from

every

actor
involved
in
these
movies
puts
in
their
worst

that
is

and
the
cgi
in
that
movie
is
top
class
blends
well
with
the
frame
blends
seamlessly
with
the
top
quality
practical
effects
on
display
and
adds
to
the
epic
scale
of
that
film
.
the
cgi
in
the
prequels
looks
cartoony
and
succeeds
in
making
everything
look
sterile
and
fake
because
the
real
actors
stand
out
from
the
frame
thanks
to
the
prolific
cg
.
the
best
light
sabre
duel
is
actually
from
phantom
menace
at
least
the
best
on
a
technical
and
directing
level
anyway
.
it
was
actually
somewhat
exciting
the
soundtrack
helped
immensely
and
had
the
brilliant
skills
of
ray
park
to
make
it
thrilling
.
but
emotionally
the
scene
was
dead
even
when
qui
gon
died
and
obi
wan
was
supposedly
angry
.
he
looked
angry
and
then
went
into
the
flouncy
choreography
straight
away
and
there
was
no
emotion
to
it
.
i
notice
in
another
comment
of
yours
that
you
dismiss
the
motion
of
the
original
duels
and
that
really
reveals
the
difference
in
audiences
nowadays
.
they
dont
care
if
it
means
anything
they
just
want
some
whizz-bang
effects
and
loud
noises
to
distract
them
for
5
minutes
.
action
for
the
sake
of
it
is
boring
it
has
to
have
meaning
or
a
sense
of
consequence
and
believability
in
order
to
have
any
impact
or
be
exciting
.
all
the
flash
and
cg
in
the
world
doesnt
change
the
fact
that
the
action
in
the
transformers
movies
is
just
not
as
exciting
as
anything
that
happens
in
the
original
die
hard
movie
.
just
as
all
the
stupid
cgi
slapstick
in
the
action
scenes
of
the
prequels
does
nothing
to
even
come
close
to
the
original
attack
on
the
death
star
despite
those
effects
being
so
much
more
primitive
.
theres
also
more
to
the
jedi
or
sith
than
their
light
sabre
fightsthat
you
focus
on
that
as
portraying
those
characters
says
all
we
need
to
know
about
how
surface
level
your
analysis
is
and
how
little
you
actually
know
about
good
film
making
.

of

who
made

i
want

rob
kwasowski
andrew
koehler
diehounderdoggen
i
actually
prefer
the
fight
choreography
in
the
originals
more
than
the
prequels
.
each
blow
has
some
weight
to
it
and
you
can
actually
grasp
whats
going
on
and
how
the
duelists
are
countering
and
anticipating
each
other
.
not
to
mention
the
tactical
retreats
and
re-engagements
in
the
empire
and
jedi
fights
which
served
to
regulate
the
rhythm
of
the
scenes
and
build
a
little
tension
from
the
anticipation
of
the
eventual
resumption
of
the
fight
.
rather
more
realistic
than
the
glo-stick
waggling
in
the
prequels
.
as
an
aside
this
reflects
lucas
appreciation
of
kurosawa
films
where
the
the
action
was
kept
basic
and
kind
of
visceral
to
avoid
drawing
attention
away
from
the
characters
.
poetry
rhymes
vomit
stanzas
etc
.
max
wylde
do
you
think
theyd
power
something
like
that
with
windmills
kiddo
its
a
thermal
exhaust
port
and
its
only
two
meters
wide
.
thermal
.
meaning
heat
.
exhaust
meaning
waste
gas
.
youre
saying
that
they
wouldnt
make
this
because.what
i
take
it
youre
not
into
engineering
.
why
not
have
something
like
this
i
mean
the
death
star
is
powered
by
a
main
reactor
.
this
indicates
that
they
have
to
have
something
that
powers
the
main
systems
mainly
propulsion
and
the
big
fucking
gun
and
that
probably
requires
a
lot
of
reactive
fuel
.
according
to
what
i
read
in
technical
fluff
lucasbooks
produced
these
are
fusion
reactors
meaning
that
they
have
a
technology
we
have
yet
to
even
accomplish
.
in
essence
what
theyve
got
in
the
main
reactor
and
all
the
smaller
reactors
all
over
this
thing
that
powers
everything
else
is
a
very
small
star
.
stars
produce
a
lot
of
heat
.
id
say
that
a
thermal
exhaust
port
is
not
only
necessary
its
probably
essential
.
why
shouldnt
it
go
all
the
way
down
to
the
main
reactor
they
didnt
think
it
would
be
vulnerable
because
frankly
look
what
it
took
to
exploit
that
weakness
.
it
took
a
force-user
going
down
a
trench
that
went
around
a
spherical
object
120km
around
flying
like
a
bat-out-of-hell
because
he
was
being
pursued
by
enemy
fighters
one
of
which
was
piloted
by
another
force-user
firing
a
shot
that
by
accounts
seemed
particularly
difficult
even
for
a
computer
.
the
shaft
was
ray-shielded
meaning
you
cant
just
shoot
blasters
down
it
so
they
had
to
use
proton
torpedoes
that
can
make
a
70000g
turn
.
im
sorry
.
i
guess
i
just
dont
quite
understand
your
problem
.

pissernacht
midichlorians
midi-fucking-chlorians
i
have
no
idea
why
that
is
in
the
movie
either
especially
considering
that
the
term
and
concept
make
no
appearance
whatsoever
in
the
following
movies
oh
god
disney
if
youre
going
to
use
midichlorians
just
please
think
it
through
jason
im
just
hoping
episode
vii
completely
disregards
the
prequels
in
the
same
way
rocky
balboa
disregarded
everything
that
happened
in
rocky
v.
in
fact
if
they
could
go
out
of
their
way
to
contradict
the
prequelslike
showing
the
stormtroopers
were
not
clones
or
having
old
footage
of
anakin
that
looks
nothing
like
the
anakin
from
the
prequelsthat
would
be
amazing
.
jason
one
thing
i
would
change
about
your
analogy
is
that
the
bathroom
sink
while
indeed
shiny
and
expensive-looking
isnt
beautiful
at
all
but
gaudy
and
over-indulgent
like
something
you
would
find
in
liberaces
bathroom
.

advise
you
not

watch

in

because
those

will
all
suck
ass
compared
to

probably
what
you
will
think
at

but
then
youll
eventually
get
through

100
half
in

all
the
side
stuff
fall
in

with

still
keep
asking
yourself

call
me
a
weird
guy
and
all
but
that
thought
makes
me
so
happy
i
want
tohow
to
put
this
i
guess
ill
try
to
describe
my
mental
imagery
i
see
myself
touching
the
sun
bringing
it
to
my
chest
where
it
enters
me
like
a
pilot
into
a
mech
afterwards
it
then
drives
me
into
a
fight
against
the
forces
of
darkness
as
if
this
was
evangelion
and
then
i
choke
zombie-mecha-hitler
with
my
dick
does
that
make
sense
cause
its
going
to
take
me
awhile
to
sort
this
through
.
at
any
rate
it
needs
to
happen
.
sonofwill
it
would
take
at
least
2
great
movies
from
disney
to
even
begin
to
obscure
the
damage
permanent
damage
mind
you
that
123
caused
.
there
is
no
going
back
.
all
of
the
loose
ends
left
by
456
have
been
permanently
answered
the
transition
of
annakin
to
darth
vader
the
clone
wars
the
context
of
yodas
journey
to
degobah
the
emergence
of
the
empire
destruction
of
the
jedi
order
etc
theres
not
much
left
for
disney
to
even
begin
with
.
that
said
i
still
hope
youre
right
.
sonofwill
the
force
is
what
gives
a
jedi
his
power
.
its
an
energy
field
created
by
all
living
things
.
it
surrounds
us
and
penetrates
us
.
it
binds
the
galaxy
together
.
obi-wan
it
is
said
that
certain
creatures
are
born
with
a
higher
awareness
of
the
force
than
humans
.
their
brains
are
different
they
have
more
midi-chlorians
in
their
cells
.
âgeorge
lucas
establishing
guidelines
for
the
expanded
universe
in
1977
i
see
a
direct
contradiction
lucas
is
claiming
that
midi-chlorians
make
people
more
aware
of
the
force
.
ignoring
for
the
moment
the
fact
that
all
living
things
are
not
just
pervaded
by
the
force
at
all
times
but
they
actually
create
the
force
themselves
making
it
downright
silly
to
think
there
would
be
greater
or
lesser
degrees
of
awareness
of
something
so
ubiquitous
the
main
contradiction
in
these
quotes
is
that
obi-wan
directly
gets
his
power
from
the
force
.
he
doesnt
mention
the
aspect
of
awareness
at
all
when
its
later
stated
that
such
awareness
of
the
force
is
the
only
real
difference
in
a
jedis
ability
.
the
most
offensive
thing
about
midi-chlorians
is
that
as
outlined
by
obi-wan
and
yoda
the
force
has
counterparts
in
many
mystic
traditions
.
luminous
beings
are
we
not
this
crude
matter
.
fuck
you
lucas
.
cabbo
remember
that
the
main
point
of
these
reviews
is
not
to
show
plot
holes
caused
by
over-fantastical
science
fiction
.
the
characters
and
their
actions
are
completely
broken
in
the
prequels
no-one
has
a
clear
motivation
or
is
able
to
act
on
a
motivation
without
doing
something
stupid
.
begging
for
realistic
characters
is
completely
justified
and
if
we
do
the
same
with
the
originals
wed
be
completely
satisfied
.
yes
you
can
nit-pick
over
the
minutiae
of
some
of
the
more
sci-fi
elements
of
the
original
trilogy
.
the
problems
discussed
in
these
reviews
arent
just
little
points
about
the
fantasy
they
show
the
cracks
running
throughout
the
entirety
of
the
prequel
series
.
additionally
even
if
the
original
trilogy
was
terrible
how
does
that
justify
the
awfulness
of
the
prequels
i
know
that
this
review
speaks
to
how
theyve
ruined
the
star
wars
franchise
but
if
you
take
that
out
then
all
the
negatives
that
lead
to
that
conclusion
still
stand
on
their
own
.
why
defend
the
prequels
by
saying
that
the
original
trilogy
is
bad
rather
than
that
the
prequels
are
good
even
if
youve
got
nostalgia
for
them
you
should
still
be
able
to
realise
that
theyre
awful
.
cabbo
if
these
really
are
your
opinions
then
youre
either
trying
far
far
too
hard
to
justify
the
prequels
in
your
own
mind
or
you
have
no
future
in
film
.
jason
the
prequels
are
non-canon
.
they
were
made
by
some
hack
fraud
who
didnt
understand
star
wars
or
even
film-making
for
that
matter
.
the
fact
this
frauds
name
was
george
lucas
doesnt
change
anything
.
as
a
wise
man
named
william
shakesman
once
said
whats
in
a
name
.
as
far
as
im
concerned
it
may
as
well
have
been
tommy
wiseau
.
youre
tearing
me
apart
padme
jason
i
think
it
would
be
too
traumatic
of
an
experience
for
him
.
you
may
as
well
ask
a
rape
victim
to
watch
the
surveillance
footage
of
them
being
repeatedly
mouth
and
ass
raped
by
george
lucas
over
the
course
of
90
minutes
when
they
were
just
10
years
old
.
tapewormbike
i
agree
although
i
think
you
misspelled
woody
allen
.
jason
jar
jar
is
actually
what
saved
this
movie
on
initial
reception
.
hes
so
awful
that
he
became
the
focal
point
for
everyones
hatred
.
everyone
left
the
theatre
thinking
you
know
if
that
stupid
jar
jar
wasnt
in
it
this
movie
probably
wouldve
been
good
.
he
was
just
so
over-the-top
bad
that
all
the
other
more
subtly
bad
things
in
the
movie
seemed
good
by
comparison
.
it
wasnt
until
the
second
and
third
movie
which
had
less
jar
jar
that
people
realized
how
wrong
they
were
.
http
this
is
really
dark
humor
.
mijk
hey
i
just
stumbled
over
this
nice
conversation
here
.
plus
points
for
us
rlm
fans
no
one
has
threatened
jm
with
rape
or
anything
there
might
still
be
some
good
in
us
.
also
no
one
quoted
plinkett
showing
him
how
stupid
he
is
but
considering
his
arguments
which
is
a
good
think
.
so
ill
join
in
to
this
bottomless
comment
section'
bashing
the
originials
is
okay
and
i
even
think
your
points
are
valid
.
the
exhaust
pipe
thing
was
a
bit
simplistic
and
was
used
to
wrap
up
things
of
enormous
proportions
pretty
quick
.
luke
didnt
get
hit
he
just
doesnt
what
a
lucky
guy..
not
the
only
one
in
movie
history
.
certainly
a
lot
of
lucky
padmes
anakains
obi-wans
in
the
prequel
as
well..
but
nevermind
that
.
what
i
rather
can
support
is
to
defend
the
prequels
.
not
every
point
plinkett
makes
is
undebatable
true
.
also
i
find
nitpicking
is
a
nice
thing
which
one
can
apply
to
every
movie
especially
your
favourite
ones
.
it
doesnt
ruin
the
movie
it
just
makes
you
wonder
about
it
again..you
dont
forget
them..
and
that
is
a
good
thingat
least
with
good
movies
.
all
in
all
plinkett
is
right
even
in
his
first
statement
.
this
movie
was
sooo
dissapointing
.
i
was
22
when
i
hit
the
theatres
in
1999
and
these
movies
werent
made
for
me
and
my
age
perhaps
but
i
was
willing
to
forgive
a
lot
.
i
still
do
.
so
defending
the
prequels
is
a
very
hard
job
.
i
would
like
to
see
a
witty
person
making
a
counter
review
to
plinkett
here
.
and
for
the
record
saying
something
like
well
you
dont
like
my
favourite
movies
i
think
your
star
wars
is
an
asshole
too
doesnt
count
as
witty
.
so
what
is
there
to
like
i
also
dont
think
all
cg
is
bad
.
naboo
looked
incredible
.
i
liked
the
royal
starship
and
darth
mauls
ship
as
an
inuendo
to
later
tie
fighters
.
i
liked
the
hippie
like
jedi
qui
gon
jinn
.
he
became
the
first
jedi
spirit
and
that
touches
upon
some
sort
of
lore
i
would
like
to
hear
more
about
.
subtlety
in
contemporary
movies
is
not
only
lacking
it
is
processed
to
camp
4
.
so
i
wonder
how
very
subtle
this
whole
thing
played
out
in
the
prequels
the
jedi
order
was
flawed
before
their
extinction
.
but
even
though
they
sort
of
knew
about
this
there
wasnt
a
final
statement
like
yoda
saying
oh
it
all
went
to
bits
because
we
havent
done
anything
.
we
must
learn
more
about
the
force
.
like
that
wicked
new
spirit
thing
qui
gon
recently
got
into
.
why
did
yoda
have
to
go
into
exile
after
breaking
up
the
fight
against
palpatine
if
he
did
so
for
becoming
wiser
and
rethink
this
whole
jedi
and
the
force
thing
couldnt
they
at
least
say
so
but
i
wanted
to
point
out
good
things
in
the
prequel
.
i
dont
mind
jar
jar
.
he
was
an
idiotic
character
for
sure
but
they
got
rid
of
him
mostly
even
in
episode
2
and
i
dont
consider
any
of
these
films
superior
to
episode
1
.
jake
lloyd
was
a
kid
in
a
star
wars
movie
.
he
was
flying
and
shooting
and
saying
some
things
.
i
dont
mind
him
either
.
i
even
prefer
him
to
his
later
incarnation
because
he
wasnt
evil
all
the
time
.
yes
lloyds
anakin
was
a
nice
helpful
boy
and
introduced
us
also
to
this
young
padawan
thing
which
got
a
dark
pay
off
in
the
end
.
palpatines
plan
well
that
is
a
biiig
nitpick
right
there
.
it
is
hard
to
look
past
the
huuuge
flaws
of
this
plan
and
the
crazy
coincidences
that
need
to
happen
to
make
him
the
emperor
in
the
end..
but
even
that
i
am
able
to
forgive
.
it
is
like
luka
and
vader
in
the
death
star
trench
very
lucky
.
i
dont
mind
inclusion
of
jabba
or
most
of
the
other
characters
since
it
wasnt
more
than
a
nod
.
including
c-3po
and
chewbacca
was
pretty
stupid
but
at
least
r2s
origin
was
handled
nicely
.
well
i
can
go
on
and
on
still
after
all
these
years
.
but
just
a
last
word
for
jonathan
martinez
here
i
also
dont
hate
the
lightsaber
duels
of
the
prequels
.
they
dont
need
to
be
overloaded
with
emotions
.
the
little
emotions
the
prequel
duels
conveyed
was
enough
for
me
.
i
at
least
understood
their
motivations
.
but
since
you
were
going
soo
into
details
about
every
move
darth
maul
qui
gon
and
obi-wan
made
during
their
battle
you
might
be
interested
in
this
video
http
jonathan
martinez
oh
we
were
just
having
a
small
conversation
.
thank
you
for
your
insightful
reply
.
i
saw
the
video
.
very
interesting
.
perhaps
there
are
no
movies
to
depict
light
saber
duels
well
enough
even
in
the
originals
ben
kenobi
vs
vader
it
looked
like
they
were
fencing
at
a
very
slow
pace
.
i
picked
darth
maul
vs
qui
gon
and
obi
wan
as
an
example
for
emotion
and
had
explained
the
reason
of
that
battles
outcome
.
the
video
you
sent
me
demontrates
how
the
director
failed
in
some
fight
choreagraphy
nontheless
it
was
exciting
for
me
that
is
.
perhaps
i
should
have
focused
on
the
duel
in
episode
3
anakin
vs
obi
wan
.
that
could
have
well
been
the
best
duel
in
the
entire
movie
series
.
in
conclusion
i
like
innovation
and
new
ideas
.
since
many
believe
the
duels
were
so
good
in
the
originals
should
they
have
done
similar
duels
in
the
prequels
i
dont
think
so
.
movies
have
to
be
made
to
convince
me
to
think
what
theyre
doing
is
real
.
akeuw
the
fights
in
these
movies
are
just
ridiculous
.
it
is
like
the
romanticized
sword
fight
versus
a
real
one
.
in
the
real
one
they
go
side
to
side
trying
to
hit
past
the
shield
.
there
are
no
overhead
hits
because
that
would
expose
the
fighter
.
same
with
the
prequels
there
are
dozens
of
opportunities
for
the
fighters
to
hit
say
the
legs
and
they
are
not
taken
.
d-man
two
minutes
of
mindless
dueling
doesnt
make
up
for
the
other
hour
of
horrible
travesties
plinkett
highlighted
that
you
apparently
completely
missed
.
you
have
no
ground
to
stand
on
.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
lucas
ruining
my
childhood
they
are
just
terribly
made
movies
in
general
and
deserve
to
be
outed
as
such
.
jrg7777
but
i
was
going
to
toshi
station
to
pick
up
some
power
converters
at
least
the
film
did
a
good
job
showing
us
where
this
annoying
line
originally
comes
from
.

star

episode
3
palpatines
pride
diehounderdoggen
it
was
the
most
3d
3d
movie
ive
ever
seen
in
3d
.
i
think
other
3d
movies
filmed
in
3d
dont
even
compare
to
the
3d-ness
of
this
3d
movie
and
visionary
3d
director
mark

deserves
some
kind
of
3d
award
for
his
3d
work
on
3d
movies
.
nautonnier
i
think
part
of
the
problem
is
that
lucas
seems
to
like
to
think
up
set
pieces
and
then
he
retrofits
a
story
around
them
.
somewhere
else
on
the
internets
there
is
a
transcript
with
lucas
spielberg
and
lawrence
kasdan
discussing
ideas
about
raiders
of
the
lost
ark
.
it
shows
that
lucas
was
a
bit
of
a
mook
even
back
then
.
it
also
demonstrates
why
empire
was
so
awesome
because
kasdan
can
bring
it
proper
.
seniorpepe
i
feel
as
though
you
dont
know
what
he
meant
by
emotionless
.
yeah
they
meant
something
as
a
part
of
the
emotional
whole
but
theres
so
much
movement
flashing
lights
and
obviously
and
awkwardly
because
of
it
choreographed
fighting
theres
no
room
to
show
their
emotions
at
the
time
.
lightsabers
are
also
overused
here
i
dont
remember
if
he
brought
that
up
in
this
review
or
his
episode
ii
review
.
alex
lee
one
minor
note
about
the
fear
leads
to
anger
part
.
the
largest
problem
moreso
than
the
interchangable
states
is
that
little
boy
anakin
has
never
really
expresses
negative
emotions
.
the
only
thing
jake
lloyd
did
adequately
is
be
happy-go-lucky
the
entire
movie
.
the
point
of
that
scene
is
to
show
us
another
side
to
anakin
but
it
fails
because
that
scene
doesnt
really
change
him
as
a
person
he
doesnt
get
angry
or
cry
or
anything
.
insteadhe
goes
right
back
to
being
happy-go-lucky
so
its
not
any
wonder
why
we
find
him
so
irritating
.
robert
eckert
captain
panaka
some
characters
i
cant
even
describe
inside
their
roles
.
robert
eckert
it
doesnt
appear
you
understood
what
hulk
was
getting
at
then
.
hulk
is
saying
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
plot
however
much
logic
the
plot
has
or
fails
to
have
is
to
understand
the
development
of
the
characters
.
plinkett
is
pointing
out
that
the
plot
holes
here
are
of
that
particularly
ruinous
kind
which
make
the
characters
actions
random
and
unmotivated
so
that
we
can
not
care
what
they
do
or
what
happens
to
them
.
alex
lee
hes
a
captainthats
it
.
robert
eckert
there
was
also
a
change
of
government
in
france
during
ww2
.
http
that
sounds
fair
enough
to
me
.
i
believe
it
.
sydneydude
aussie
plinkett
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
with
these
reviews
lol
these
prequels
are
the
result
of
lucas
not
having
other
movies
and
stories
to
rip
off
this
time
around
hes
been
exposed
as
the
fraud
he
is
who
rode
in
on
the
tailcoats
of
the
others
who
actually
pulled
together
and
made
the
original
trilogy
while
he
was
given
a
lollipop
and
told
to
sit
in
a
corner
with
his
star
wars
dolls
.
starcrunch
dead
on
.
i
think
george
lucas
has
this
idea
of
something
really
cool
thats
going
to
happen
and
then
writes
his
story
to
fit
that
cool
thing
in
.
its
not
the
worst
idea
plenty
of
writers
do
the
same
thing
.
but
when
you
are
trying
to
incorporate
some
byzantine
intrigue
and
labyrinthine
plots
it
really
doesnt
work
.
starcrunch
im
not
confusing
jake
lloyd
or
hayden
christensen
for
that
matter
with
a
good
actor
but
no
one
and
i
mean
no
one
saves
this
poorly-conceived
anakin
.
the
reason
you
say
he
adequately
portrays
happy-go-lucky
is
because
thats
the
only
thing
given
to
him
.
you
could
have
had
the
best
child
actor
out
there
and
it
would
have
been
the
same
.
the
problem
is
the
writing
long
before
the
casting
even
gets
considered
.
mitchell

whens

they

david

it
breaks
my
heart
to
tell
you
this
but
you
are
right
mr.
plinkett
and
i
admire
your
honesty
.
i
dont
think
that
george
was
the
main
driving
force
for
new
hope
empire
strikes
back
after
witnessing
the
mess
that
are
the
star

pre-quels
.
roll
on
the
re-boot
paulus
caãamonjas
i
am
missing
some
non
anglogermanic
names
too
.
but
i
think
itâs
stylistically
designed
to
be
that
way
i.e
kind
of
bigger
and
familiar
names
so
the
audience
gets
the
basic
point
of
his
exposition
.
skulb
clearly
a
very
positive
aspect
of
pm
is
that
mike
hamill
isnt
in
it
.
just
saying
aegerprimo
i
enjoyed
that
.
what
was
with
the
woman
tied
up
in
the
basement
lol
.
ireth
you
kinda
did
ask
idiots
to
explain
.
qui-gon
jinn
was
this
stuborn
jedi
master
that
folows
his
heart
and
strongly
does
what
he
belevies
in
even
if
it
cost
his
reputation
jedi
council
seat
or
even
life
.
also
hes
inteligent
and
insightfull
more
than
other
characters
cause
he
has
seen
more
and
did
more
in
his
life
rather
than
siting
in
a
room
and
discuss
politics
.
hes
caring
compationate
real
friend
and
really
really
good
teacher
.
given
that
he
thought
obi
everything
he
could
and
made
him
prepared
to
become
master
even
before
he
realized
that..to
anser
your
question
star
wars
prequel
trilogy
is
all
about
anakin
becoming
what
he
was
in
original
trilogy
.
even
if
you
meet
him
in
45
minutes
which
was
case
in
some
oter
movies
too
where
you
meet
protagonist
very
late
in
movie
what
can
you
expect
from
the
boy
that
is
f
7
years
old
and
were
a
slave
to
have
goal..to
know
where
he
is
in
life
to
know
what
he
want
to
become
dude
youre
reatrted
as
much
as
your
voice
isthis
movie
is
not
made
for
ppl
who
watch
star
wars
with
same
ethusiasm
as
tonights
show
let
me
see
you
where
were
you
in
life
when
you
were
7
.
manwithoutfear
whos
that
manwithoutfear
the
problem
is
indeed
the
writing
.
anakin
skywalker
should
be
conflicted
troubled
charismatic
deep
explosive
interesting
compelling
intense
and
brilliant
.
in
the
prequels
he
is
none
of
those
things
.
its
not
fair
manwithoutfear
i
would
love
it
if
these
new
movies
were
a
massive
hit
and
as
a
result
they
went
back
and
remade
the
prequels
.
manwithoutfear
the
newer
movies
fail
on
a
fundamental
storytelling
level
.
amen
.
manwithoutfear
i
know
its
all
about
opinions
but
how
somebody
can
prefer
the
prequels
to
the
originals
is
beyond
me
.
the
originals
are
superior
in
every
way
.
including
special
effects
.
manwithoutfear
the
prequels
couldve
been
the
greatest
movies
ever
made
.
it
genuinely
still
hurts
me
that
theyre
so
awful
.
manwithoutfear
if
you
favour
style
over
substance
as
you
clearly
do
with
your
lightsaber
duel
preferences
thats
up
to
you
.
for
me
the
best
lightsaber
duel
is
and
will
always
be
skywalker
v
vader
in
empire
strikes
back
.
vfx_privateer

dismal

the
worst
ive
ever

would

around

time
the

also
on

where
did
you
even
get
those
impressions
of
him
cause
if
it
isnt
from
the

well
that
is
the
point
isnt
it
the

did
nothing
to
tell
us
who
he
his

what

stardog
champion
star
wars
episode
1
was
the
worst
thing
since
my
son
i
have
watched
this
review
like
100
times
by
now
and
i
can
never
and
repeat
never
get
tired
of
that
line
.
by
far
one
of
the
best
opening
lines
ever
to
a
review
.
it
would
be
funny
if
a
high
school
kid
writes
an
essay
for
a
contest
and
he
starts
off
with
that
similar
line
for
examplethe
vietnam
war
was
the
worst
thing
since
my
son
.
what
a
classic
line
.
stardog
champion
the
thing
hate
about
episode
1
was
the
characters
.
their
really
was
no
interesting
characters
.
on
top
of
that
the
story
and
dialogue
was
so
boring
.
their
some
unique
element
in
the
film
like
the
whole
chosen
one
angle
lucas
was
going
for
.
imo
the
movie
should
have
focus
solely
on
the
prophecy
concept
.
the
whole
idea
of
anakin
skywalker
being
space
jesus
could
be
good
if
done
right
of
course
.
the
only
thing
i
like
was
the
action
scenes
and
the
music
.
phil
hardcoreso
coulda
done
without
the
whole
i
kidnap
and
beat

excuse
for
a
joke
margarinebutter
oh
my
god
you
just
gave
me
a
brain
aneurysm
.
caleb
bubba
gafford
first
i
will
admit
that
the
story
is
illogical
in
episode
1
as
are
most
fantasysci-fi
plots
because
they
all
tend
to
ignore
common
sense
and
practical
solutions
in
favor
of
theatrics
.
and
2
and
3
seem
to
me
to
advance
the
plots
that
were
left
hanging
in
ep
.
1
except
the
midichlorian
issue
i
admit
.
that
being
said
there
were
discrepancies
of
logic
in
the
original
trilogy
as
well
as
far
as
what
they
shouldve
couldve
or
wouldve
done
.
secondly
from
someone
who
has
never
read
the
peripherals
regarding
the
prequel
trilogy
i
found
qui
gon
to
be
a
passionate
master
who
leads
with
his
gut
the
opposite
of
most
jedi
and
queen
amidala
was
young
but
intelligent
and
wise
beyond
her
years
.
but
with
youth
comes
the
obstacle
of
being
underestimated
.
but
she
is
someone
who
would
put
her
duty
above
all
else
at
least
in
the
beginning
.
third
i
find
that
telling
a
story
of
a
powerful
order
and
republic
being
uprooted
by
villains
who
dont
have
the
initial
advantage
the
opposite
of
the
original
trilogy
is
harder
to
do
thus
that
explains
why
they
had
to
set
up
with
extra
characters
and
take
three
times
as
long
as
to
get
their
points
a
crossed
.
fourth
i
enjoyed
how
they
used
politics
to
move
the
story
rather
than
a
personal
journey
.
im
a
huge
game
of
thrones
fan
and
lastly
the
issue
of
the
battle
scenes
being
70
choreographed
combat
and
special
effects
in
order
to
push
a
movie
now
days
that
is
what
it
takes
case
in
point
the
new
star
trek
i
dont
mind
pandering
to
the
main
stream
as
long
as
it
keeps
our
nerdy
interests
alive

booger
do
you
know
plinkett
booger
i
just
found
this
and
i
felt
i
should
share
with
those
who
havent
seen
it
.
httpsyoure
welcome
or.sorry
whatever
.
tastyslowcooker
firstly
i
picture
you
in
old
clothes
socks
and
sandals
on
a
street
corner
handing
out
pamphlets
and
asking
do
you
know
plinkett
secondly
it
amuses
me
that
born-again
plinkians
think
that
this
is
a
good
response
to
criticisms
of
his
unnecessarily
offensive
form
of
comedy
.
its
as
if
knowing
plinkett
will
magically
transform
the
viewer
into
someone
who
will
find
this
humour
funny
.
booger
i
dont
think
everything
rlm
does
is
law
.
i
actually
just
posted
a
comment
disagreeing
with
them
in
the
amazing
spiderman
2
review
about
a
different
movie
.
i
just
understand
the
joke
and
character
you
high-on-your-horse-asshole
.
its
an
exaggeration
of
what
is
perceived
as
an
old
recluse
and
obsessive
star
warsstar
trek
fan
that
actually
makes
valid
points
about
the
films
and
filmaking
in
general
.
it
makes
the
review
more
interesting
and
was
part
of
its
success
.
its
okay
if
you
dont
like
get
the
joke
just
dont
say
its
an
excuse
.
tastyslowcooker
you
realize
im
a
different
person
to
the
one
who
originally
posted
right
that
i
never
called
it
an
excuse
booger
i
do
.
i
dont
care
.
you
defended
it
.
and
youre
wrong
.
tastyslowcooker
said
like

never
claimed
to
have
clever
wordplay
alex

dont
any
of
you
fuckheads
say
it
was
explained
more
in
the

.
what
matters
is
the
movie
i
aint
never
read
any

books

books
in

anyone
know

there
are

anywhere

where
does
the

i
couldnt
think
of
a
better
way
to
mark
the
15th
anniversary
of
the
phantom
menaces
release
than
re-watching
this
review
.
its
a
salve
for
the
bitter
disappointment
this
film
has
caused
me
that
still
stings
to
this
very
day
.
margarinebutter
lolwut
donald
hermann
its
called
characterization
and
its
clearly
fictional
.
so
is
your
problem
with
drama
do
you
read
romeo
and
juliet
and
go
off
on
a
tangent
about
how
you
dont
appreciate
the
whole
tacked
on
element
of
teenage
suicide
thatguy
nah
this
guy
is
hardcore
so
.
someone
else
figure
this
out
.
alex
lee
not
hating
on
jake
lloyd
but
it
just
seems
like
a
bad
idea
to
cast
a
6
year
old
because
its
so
hard
for
them
to
given
them
precise
direction
.
seemed
a
little
smarter
to
start
with
a
8-9
year
old
for
just
enough
control
before
puberty
hits
them
.
stardog
champion
the
expanded
universe
did
somewhat
save
the
prequel
trilogy
with
its
extended
information
on
the
story
.
but
since
disney
decided
to
act
like
dick
and
announce
the
eu
is
no
longer
apart
of
the
6
original
trilogy
the
prequel
story
went
from
barely
ok
to
being
shit
again
.
now
we
are
once
again
stuck
with
the
incoherent
storytelling
that
was
set
in
the
prequels
and
episode
7
story
is
going
to
make
no
sense
at
all
.
blahdeeblah
im
not
sure
how
its
a
compliment
that
tolkien
used
magic
to
explain
much
of
his
world
as
that
didnt
stop
him
going
into
ludicrously
detailed
mind-numbing
explanations
that
saps
all
the
fun
out
of
the
experience
.
theres
like
3
pages
in
lotr
devoted
to
hobbit
lineages
for
fucks
sake
.
at
the
heart
of
the
prequels
problems
is
lucas
inability
to
create
believable
characters
with
any
level
of
depth
.
tolkien
has
much
the
same
problem
indeed
he
is
even
worse
all
his
characters
are
just
empty
vessels
for
his
narration
.
the
only
way
you
ever
get
any
variation
to
tolkiens
characters
is
when
they
belong
to
different
species
.
or
are
good
rather
than
evil
.
the
lotr
films
are
such
good
adaptations
because
the
pointless
tedious
elements
of
the
original
story
were
removed
the
characters
were
given
actual
personalities
we
could
believe
in
care
about
.
tolkien
wrote
vast
epic
stories
created
a
world
you
can
immerse
yourself
in
because
it
is
so
detailed
so
much
thought
has
gone
into
it
.
lucas
has
done
much
the
same
though
.
what
made
either
of
their
stories
palatable
boils
down
to
the
other
people
involved
people
who
injected
empathy
and
streamlined
the
story
into
something
coherent
entertaining
.
veteran
of
the
psychic
wars
heres
the
thing
theyre
not
keeping
your
nerdy
interests
alive
.
theyre
cannibalising
recognisable
brand
names
to
make
disposible
dumbed
down
lowest
common
denominator
entertainment
for
the
dumb
masses
.
theyre
the
cinematic
equivalent
of
a
mcdonalds
hamburger
called
the
jedi
mcbacon
or
the
cheese
bat-burger
.
theyre
just
exploiting
a
brand
.
nerds
like
you
and
i
only
enter
into
the
equation
to
the
degree
that
they
might
squeeze
some
dollars
from
our
irrational
affection
for
certain
characters
.
these
piece
of
shit
prequels
are
a
perfect
example
of
a
horrible
artless
product
cynically
engineered
to
make
money
simply
on
the
basis
of
their
brands
popularity
.
they
dont
even
have
the
base
crude
appeal
of
the
transformer
movies
.
take
away
the
name
star
wars
and
these
things
would
have
bombed
at
the
box
office
.
but
thats
me
.
im
a
nerd
with
nerdy
interests
im
a
spider-man
fan
for
instance
but
im
not
going
to
like
a
piece
of
shit
movie
like
the
first
amazing
i
havent
seen
the
second
just
because
hey
its
a
spider-man
movie
.
lets
put
it
this
way
our
nerd
affection
is
kinda
like
brand
loyalty
.
and
enabling
assholes
like
lucas
is
every
bit
as
self-defeating
as
buying
a
shit
ford
instead
of
a
good
i
dunno
a
good
toyota
just
because
im
a
ford
man
.
veteran

im
gon
na
do
like
alex

and
quote
some
plinkett
at
you
dont
any
of
you
fuckheads
say
it
was
explained
more
in
the
novelization
or
some
star

book
.
what
matters
is
the
movie
dont
talk
about
them
stupid
video
games
or
novels
comic
books
or
any
of
that
fucking
crap
.
except
im
not
calling

that
blew

sorry
folks
but
mr.

mind
is
far
superior
over
nc
.
https
alex
lee
were
i
a
ten
year-old
i
would
agree
with
nc
.
as
an
adult
plinkett
is
indeed
far
superior
.
even
when
plinkett
is
not
even
directly
arguing
with
nc
hes
punching
holes
in
ncs
arguments
.
nc
even
indirectly
concedes
to
plinketts
points
at
times
.
debate-wise
plinkett
wins
.
entertainment-wise
plinkett
is
the
coke
classic
of
movie

while
nc
is
somewhere
between
pepsi
and
rc
cola

patrick
wow
i
forget
how
creepy
it
is
that
an
8-year-old
is
chatting
up
a
16-year-old
and
its
working
.
galleymac
of
the
three
in
this
video
id
have
chosen
the
one
just
before
the
one
they
actually
chose
the
second
kid
.
really
though
i
was
hoping
that
the
child
who
grew
up
to
be
darth
freaking
vader
would
be
darker
mysterious
more
of
a
creepy
kid
not
full
on
wednesday
addams
but
definitely
less
brian
bonsall
from
family
ties
.
there
are
little
kids
like
the
one
they
cast
and
then
there
are
rarer
kids
ones
who
are
quiet
who
stand
back
and
observe
and
then
come
out
with
things
you
wouldnt
expect
from
them
their
appeal
is
not
all
vested
in
the
twee
mispronunciation
of
words
but
on
the
impression
that
something
is
lurking
beneath
their
surface
i
went
into
the
film
thinking
we
were
getting
something
along
those
lines
.

you
know
whats
worse
than
that
shitty
episode
1
movie
that
guys
voice
.
fnertle
i
will
admit
that
the
story
is
illogical
as
are
most
fantasysci-fi
plots
excuse
me
for
you
to
make
a
statement
like
that
i
suspect
you
havent
read
too
much
science
fiction
and
therefore
you
take
it
as
given
that
when
you
refer
to
fantasysci-fi
we
understand
that
you
are
referring
to
movies
.
there
is
always
the
possibility
of
a
small
inconsistency
in
order
to
move
a
story
along
we
are
talking
about
large
inconsistencies
that
strain
the
limits
of
credibility
and
the
suspension
of
disbelief
ones
that
break
you
out
of
the
story
and
have
you
actively
questioning
the
plot
as
the
story
is
unfolding
.
if
you
enjoyed
the
prequel
trilogy
i
dont
begrudge
you
that
however
you
wont
be
able
to
convince
me
that
the
storytelling
and
respect
for
the
intelligence
of
the
viewer
compare
to
the
original
.
there
is
some
solid
content
in
the
prequels
but
there
is
also
evident
lazy
writing
and
general
contempt
for
the
viewing
audience
.
a
list
of
stories
would
be
too
long
so
here
is
a
short
list
of
authors
that
you
might
find
a
little
more
logical
in
no
order
i
dont
want
to
start

what
is
it
with
ricks
jager
so
while
i
agree
with
most
of
this
i
got
ta
say
the
point
of
a
deflector
shield
is
to
prevent
the
ship
from
getting
hit
in
the
first
place
not
absorb
damage
like
a
health
bar
.
most
shots
would
just
bounce
off
which
is
why
the
ship
doesnt
get
it
after
its
fixed
.
luckypowerful
shots
could
still
break
through
which
caused
the
damage
in
the
first
place
.
not
that
this
saves
any
part
of
this
scene
though
yeesh
.
sinwar
who
came
up
with
the
retarded
idea
to
let
the
dealer
whose
race
is
intelligent
and
immune
to
jedi
influence
try
a
dice
based
gambling
bet
you
know
against
a
jedi
with
telekinetic
abilities
thomas
hunt
his
point
was
that
the
matrix
and
the
other
movies
he
mentioned
at
least
had
a
protagonist
.
thomas
hunt
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
what
plinkett
says
about
lightsaber
duels
in
this
review
and
all
his
others
is
true
for
fight
scenes
in
general
.
fight
scenes
are
just
that
scenes
.
their
purpose
is
to
advance
the
plot
and
develop
character
.
in
the
original
trilogy
the
fight
scenes
were
not
only
justified
but
necessary
.
creative
choreography
can
be
fun
on
its
own
they
live
but
the
ultimate
point
of
a
fight
is
to
progress
the
story
.
romeo
and
juliet
plays
in
the
1600s
probably
didnt
have
very
convincing
swordplay
but
obviously
that
didnt
keep
it
from
becoming
one
of
the
most
well-known
stories
in
world
literature
.
even
in
pro
wrestling
a
medium
where
a
large
part
of
the
appeal
is
in
the
aesthetics
of
the
simulated
violence
there
are
storylines
and
things
at
stake
to
justify
why
matches
occur
.
sometimes
those
elements
are
absent
but
even
then
a
good
wrestler
will
captivate
the
audience
with
his
charisma
.
because
of
this
fans
will
become
invested
in
these
wrestlers
over
time
and
will
consistently
root
for
them
regardless
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
their
matches
.
going
back
to
film
that
just
illustrates
why
its
important
for
the
audience
to
actually
like
andor
care
about
the
people
fighting
.
chien_clean
but
matrix
had
a
horrible
protagonist
.
the
movie
was
great
despite
neokeanu
.
so
it
was
bad
example
.
the
other
movies
i
agree
with
.
thomas
hunt
just
to
add
in
regards
to
the
final
duel
in
empire
there
are
a
few
things
plinkett
didnt
quite
touch
on
.
lukes
first
fight
with
vader
is
a
david
vs.
goliath
battle
much
like
the
x-wings
taking
on
the
death
star
in
the
first
movie
.
this
time
its
different
though
because
luke
fails
and
ends
up
getting
his
hand
chopped
off
.
even
though
he
loses
though
there
are
still
moments
in
the
fight
where
he
surprises
vader
with
his
skill
and
perseverance
like
when
he
narrowly
escapes
being
frozen
by
force
jumping
out
of
the
carbonite
chamber
.
its
moments
like
those
that
really
resonate
with
an
audience
.
underdogs
are
awesome
and
when
the
odds
are
really
stacked
against
them
every
hit
they
land
can
seem
significant
.
just
think
of
rocky
managing
to
floor
apollo
creed
in
the
first
round
.
even
though
that
was
brief
and
only
served
to
piss
his
opponent
off
it
got
the
audiences
blood
pumping
.
i
havent
seen
phantom
menace
in
maybe
ten
years
but
looking
back
at
the
clips
i
saw
there
doesnt
seem
be
that
same
kind
of
tension
and
excitement
.
there
was
so
much
spinning
and
flailing
that
none
of
their
attacks
seemed
very
significant
this
is
something
that
plinkett
did
mention
.
plus
the
darth
maul
battle
was
initially
two-on-one
which
kind
of
makes
him
the
underdog
even
if
he
is
a
really
powerful
sith
lord
with
a
double-lightsaber
.
if
you
made
mike
tyson
fight
two
inferior
but
accomplished
contenders
at
the
same
time
youd
probably
expect
tyson
to
lose
even
if
he
had
horseshoes
in
his
gloves
.
jesus
sucked
gay
penis
this
is
quite
good
.
its
hard
to
find
faults
in
most
of
his
points
.
i
suspect
he
might
be
a
criminal
though
.
thomas
hunt
i
see
what
youre
trying
to
say
but
it
still
works
as
an
example
because
people
like
the
movie
itself
and
neo
is
well-known
.
a
lot
of
people
arent
super
crazy
about
luke
skywalker
or
at
least
mark
hamills
performance
but
hes
still
one
of
the
first
characters
who
come
to
mind
when
they
hear
the
word
protagonist
.
moot
point
.
i
thought
you
misunderstood
plinkett
in
your
first
comment
but
i
was
wrong
.
david
damico
since
i
loved
the
prequels
people
have
been
telling
me
to
watch
this
review
im
not
impressed
by
this
at
all
.
sisyphus
that
is
why
you
fail
.
thatguy
the
feeling
of
realising
you
loved
something
that
sucks
so
much
is
a
let
down
.
sorry
but
itll
pass
.
fluffybuddha
anyone
know
where
i
can
find
a
copy
of
the
long
rebuttal
to
these
videos
some
fanboy
wrote
radosåaw
hoådys
fun
fact
about
the
low
angle
of
the
star
destroyer
in
the
original
star
wars
isthey
shot
it
that
way
because
they
didnt
have
the
other
half
of
the
model
finished
so
again
art
from
adversity
.
grizzly
funny
i
saw
the
phantom
menace
when
it
came
out
and
after
the
movie
ended
i
had
no
idea
what
it
was
about
.
all
these
years
later
i
still
havent
figured
it
out
.
i
went
into
it
expecting
to
see
stuff
getting
blown
up
some
cool
aliens
maybe
hopefully
a
chick
in
a
metal
bikini
plus
a
little
bit
of
talking
.
what
i
got
instead
were
trade
negotiations
and
parliamentary
maneuvering
.
wtf
shon
burch
just
because
he
is
immune
to
mind
tricks
and
knows
that
doesnt
mean
he
is
familiar
with
jedi
using
the
force
otherwise
.
ranger
boo
the
amount
of
people
that
stick
up
for
the
prequels
makes
my
depressed
and
lose
whatever
little
faith
i
have
in
humanity
.
dont
read
the
youtube
for
this
review

deebeecooper
this
review
is
not
for
idiots
.
i
think
he
makes
this
clear
in
the
very
beginning
of
the
video
.
deebeecooper
i
was
with
you
until
i
saw
your
idiotic
name
he
might
be
criminal
but
youre
an
asshole
.
deebeecooper
you
had
me
at
fuck
you
lucas
.
jesus
sucked
gay
penis
ah
well
haters
gon
na
hate
.
imafckingdragn
what
jesus
does
in
his
private
time
is
no
ones
business
but
his
own
.
imafckingdragn
i
was
about
to
say
the
scene
still
serves
no
purpose
.
but
you
seem
to
have
already
destroyed
your
own
argument
.
i
admire
that
efficiency
.
imafckingdragn
youre
a
bad
protagonist
imafckingdragn
sounds
like
someone
needs
a
flagpin
siliconnoob
enough
with
the
complaining
dont
you
have
some
transformers
films
to
watch
siliconnoob
was
the
penis
in
question
your
own
jesus
sucked
gay
penis
unfortunately
no
.
also
hes
been
dead
for
nearly
2000
years
.
id
thought
the
answer
was
obvious
.
jager
i
just
like
the
concept
of
a
deflector
shield
instead
of
shields
being
a
little
blue
bar
of
ablative
hp
.
so
defending
the
concept
instead
of
the
movie
i
guess
.
ispyrory
.
when
i
first
saw
the
phantom
menace
i
can
remember
defending
the
awesome
choreography
of
the
darth
maul
fight
because
it
was
the
only
part
of
the
movie
that
i
found
cool
and
enjoyable
.
now
recognizing
how
little
merit
it
had
for
the
characters
and
overarching
story
thanks
asshole
i
must
concede
that
episode
1
was
a
totally
irredeemable
piece
of
shit
.
alex
lee
and
even
then
the
only
choreography
that
still
continues
to
look
good
is
darth
maul
himself
.
obi-wan
and
qui-gonn
are
just
so
sloppy
in
comparison
every
time
they
turn
around
to
make
a
swing
that
will
functionally
do
no
more
damage
than
if
they
didnt
do
that
.
nicholasribcage
this
is
what
started
it
all
.
its
this
video
that
ruined
me
.
corrupted
me
.
tormented
my
very
soul
.
i
need
a
vodka
gimlet
if
im
gon
na
watch
this
again
.
looks
for
bottle
usucdik
making
some
good
points
but
10
minutes
in
that
voice
is
entirely
too
obnoxious
to
continue
.
i
cant
stand
it
enough
to
find
of
any
this
funny
or
amusing
.
id
rather
he
cut
out
his
throat
and
use
a
fake
robotic
voice
box
instead
of
sounding
like
a
marble-mouthed
lethargic
drunk
fatso
.
alcaldeeste
how
the
hell
can
something
that
was
written
by
someone
else
save
a
movie
the
movie
has
its
own
story
and
its
own
characters
.
should
the
movie
be
judged
on
its
own
merits
or
should
it
be
judged
on
the
merits
of
some
fanfiction
jerk-off
material
that
1
was
written
by
someone
who
was
not
involved
in
the
movie
2
was
written
after
the
movie
was
already
made
and
3
will
be
read
by
0.000001
of
the
movies
audience
hmmm
dean
mcintosh
in
the
film
they
were
trying
to
communicate
that
the
jedi
were
after
thousands
of
years
of
there
being
no
sith
they
were
unprepared
to
deal
with
enemies
that
might
wield
lightsabres
against
them
.
theres
also
lightsabre
physics
revolving
around
how
the
mechanism
by
which
they
work
causes
them
to
be
extremely
unstable
in
the
hands
of
people
who
lack
the
force
.
the
implication
being
that
darth
maul
kicks
so
much
arse
that
he
can
wield
a
weapon
that
is
more
than
twice
as
complicated
to
use
and
do
so
more
effectively
than
two
jedi
with
simpler
weapons
.
yes
i
know
this
is
all
stuff
from
encyclopedias
and
such
shite
but
that
is
part
of
my
point
.
lucas
relied
so
much
on
this
expanded
universe
encyclopedia
stuff
that
he
says
no
longer
counts
to
explain
away
what
was
his
job
as
the
director
to
tell
us
.
ironically
if
a
director
had
found
a
good
way
to
explain
to
us
that
lightsabres
have
a
gyroscopic
effect
and
can
not
be
wielded
by
just
anybody
whilst
at
the
same
time
explaining
how
han
was
able
to
cut
open
a
tauntaun
with
one
in
spite
of
that
that
would
be
just
competent
filmmaking
.
good
filmmaking
if
they
do
it
well
.
the
scenes
in
robocop
where
they
are
assembling
robocop
whilst
his
viewpoint
sees
them
its
titanium
laminated
with
kevlar
are
an
example
of
this
kind
of
exposition
done
like
a
boss
.
lucas
has
never
worked
with
_anyone_
good
enough
to
do
it
that
well
but
even
a
quarter
of
the
way
would
have
been
better
than
what
we
got
.
even
with
a
good
explanation
like
that
this
would
not
negate
the
fact
that
all
three
participants
in
the
duel
violate
the
first
rule
of
fencing
and
do
so
repeatedly
.
that
is
never
show
your
opponent
your
back
.
dean
mcintosh
when
i
was
younger
i
had
a
similar
mindset
.
i
would
defend
tpm
zealously
even
though
i
had
very
little
basis
from
the
actual
film
to
defend
it
with
.
and
the
more
i
began
to
write
stories
of
my
own
write
things
then
pick
them
apart
and
put
them
back
together
and
just
try
to
assemble
something
that
a
professional
artist
would
be
keen
to
publish
rather
than
send
back
and
tell
me
was
crap
the
more
i
realised
.
i
realised
that
everything
plinkett
says
in
this
video
is
spot-on
.
given
how
long
between
return
and
phantom
lucas
had
it
baffles
me
that
he
was
in
such
a
rush
to
get
a
script
finished
.
it
reminds
me
of
that
statement
about
videogames
.
a
story
is
late
until
it
is
released
but
it
sucks
forever
.
simply
delaying
the
release
by
a
year
or
two
and
giving
the
script
to
someone
who
can
write
a
good
story
would
have
saved
tpm
.
above
i
wrote
in
response
to
a
comment
by
alex
lee
.
in
my
response
i
write
how
one
can
simply
expect
an
audience
to
automatically
know
something
.
or
worse
yet
expect
them
to
read
up
about
it
in
a
canon-guide
that
a
scant
fifteen
years
later
you
will
tell
them
is
invalid
.
that
is
what
lucas
essentially
did
here
.
no
explanation
other
than
how
you
test
positive
for
jedi
is
offered
concerning
the
mechanics
of
the
star
wars
universe
.
that
is
very
very
bad
storytelling
.
since
i
used
the
example
of
robocop
above
i
will
repeat
it
here
.
in
five
minutes
flat
paul
and
ed
explained
everything
that
the
audience
needed
to
know
in
order
to
not
only
have
it
make
sense
but
for
it
to
be
one
of
the
most
awesome
times
one
can
have
passively
watching
images
.
tpm
by
comparison
gives
us
oh
let
me
administer
this
blood
test
hey
congratulations
you
are
a
jedi
and
nothing
else
.
even
when
the
fans
might
want
it
.
we
see
nothing
of
how
jedi
are
trained
under
optimal
circumstances
how
lightsabres
work
or
even
what
makes
a
person
want
to
become
a
jedi
.
in
fact
that
last
one
is
a
really
sore
point
.
you
see
all
that
the
prequels
have
succeeded
in
is
making
the
people
who
were
supposed
to
be
good
guys
in
the
other
three
films
look
like
assholes
that
nobody
in
their
right
mind
would
want
to
be
.
in
the
prequels
jedi
are
people
that
i
would
cut
down
with
my
lightsabre
if
i
caught
them
anywhere
near
my
nephew
or
nieces
.
and
that
is
all
thanks
to
george
lucas
exquisitely
bad
storytelling
.
in
other
plinkett
reviews
he
says
lets
stop
and
think
about
this
for
a
second
or
words
to
that
effect
at
least
once
.
i
would
urge
you
to
do
the
same
.
dean
mcintosh
thomas
i
would
like
to
wrap
your
comments
up
in
a
bow
and
send
them
to
one
poster
just
above
you
on
this
page
.
i
just
wanted
to
chuck
in
my
pennies
about
a
couple
of
things
you
write
.
i
think
the
same
effect
the
who-cares-what-is-happening
effect
occurs
in
peter
jacksons
middle
earth
in
name
only
films
.
i
was
watching
a
lot
of
the
making-ofs
around
the
time
that
the
home
video
releases
were
occurring
and
one
thing
i
could
not
get
past
no
matter
how
i
tried
was
all
of
the
bragging
about
how
these
big
battle
sequences
were
50
minutes
long
and
had
thousands
of
characters
involved
.
when
i
was
looking
over
the
finished
product
many
things
came
to
mind
.
one
he
was
lying
when
he
said
characters
.
theres
maybe
one
or
two
characters
in
each
film
that
the
audience
is
given
enough
reason
to
care
about
and
the
rest
of
the
battle
is
basically
anonymous
figures
in
a
computer
killing
each
other
in
videogame
ways
.
second
and
this
is
what
i
wanted
to
touch
on
in
terms
of
the
empire
duel
the
story
does
not
progress
one
iota
whilst
these
protracted
battle
sequences
take
place
.
it
is
as
if
the
story
stops
dead
while
good
stereotype
guys
murder
the
shit
out
of
bad
stereotype
guys
.
empire
achieves
something
that
i
have
only
seen
duplicated
in
one
other
film
that
i
can
remember
13
assassins
.
as
the
duel
and
escape-fight
progresses
you
learn
new
things
about
the
characters
.
you
learn
that
there
is
a
point
that
pushing
lando
past
will
get
him
to
turn
on
you
even
when
you
have
him
by
the
proverbials
.
you
learn
that
leia
really
is
in
love
with
han
.
and
most
importantly
you
learn
that
luke
and
vader
are
not
just
play-fencing
like
children
.
at
the
start
of
that
duel
i
could
not
help
but
think
vader
must
be
thinking
if
i
did
not
need
this
suit
just
to
exist
i
would
hand
this
boy
his
arse
in
no
time
.
then
as
luke
uses
the
force
to
escape
traps
vader
adjusts
his
strategy
around
the
fact
that
luke
might
not
be
completely
incompetent
after
all
.
the
moments
when
vader
is
using
the
force
to
throw
stuff
at
luke
battering
him
are
all
about
softening
luke
up
for
taking
to
the
emperor
.
but
the
real
fusion
of
storytelling
with
visual
excitement
is
that
quick
moment
where
luke
hits
a
hit
into
vader
that
makes
him
say
ouch
then
quickly
retaliates
by
cutting
lukes
hand
off
.
we
see
that
had
luke
exercised
some
patience
and
not
given
in
to
the
visions
of
his
friends
being
tortured
the
outcome
of
the
fight
might
have
been
very
different
.
he
learned
enough
along
the
way
to
at
least
remind
vader
that
vader
is
not
invulnerable
.
i
will
be
brief
about
jedi
.
that
score
music
where
we
hear
the
baritone
men
wordlessly
hum
tells
more
story
than
anything
going
on
in
the
other
two
segments
of
the
battle
put
together
.
it
tells
the
audience
oh
no
everything
the
last
few
jedi
have
been
striving
for
for
the
past
five
or
six
hours
is
gone
maybe
forever
.
it
is
the
star
wars
equivalent
of
the
moment
in
robocop
where
robocop
is
angrily
striding
out
of
his
rest
chamber
with
science
men
vainly
urging
him
to
stop
.
call
me
what
you
like
but
i
actually
enjoyed
jedi
slightly
more
than
any
other
sw
film
for
that
part
alone
.
but
the
point
of
all
that
is
that
it
proves
plinkett
is
right
about
the
duels
.
they
are
not
about
fighting
but
rather
the
story
that
leads
into
them
.
and
the
story
that
leads
into
the
tpm
duels
is
crap
no
its
shit
i
do
however
disagree
about
the
darth
maul
duel
up
to
a
point
.
there
are
underdogs
and
underdogs
.
and
again
this
is
part
of
what
plinkett
is
talking
about
in
his
review
about
the
story
versus
choreography
.
yes
i
know
saying
the
novel
says
is
boneheaded
but
hear
me
out
.
the
text
about
the
duel
talks
about
how
maul
is
always
in
control
how
after
this
amount
of
time
the
jedi
are
no
closer
to
winning
and
so
forth
.
but
because
we
are
given
no
basis
on
which
to
understand
how
elite
maul
is
supposed
to
be
we
can
not
understand
things
like
that
from
the
film
.
what
i
would
have
done
is
have
a
few
scenes
in
the
film
where
jedi
are
being
killed
in
groups
and
nobody
knows
who
is
doing
it
until
maul
pops
out
of
nowhere
on
tattooine
and
tries
to
take
down
qui-gon
.
a
quick
moment
where
five
jedi
are
coming
to
the
aid
of
some
unrelated
person
and
maul
kills
them
all
.
anything
like
that
.
but
lucas
is
and
was
such
an
idiot
that
he
thinks
he
can
just
have
one
actor
with
no
character
development
whatever
do
flips
and
kicks
and
swing
a
two-bladed
sabre
and
audiences
will
automatically
twig
that
the
jedi
are
coming
from
a
place
of
weakness
in
this
battle
.
it
is
kind
of
like
how
they
do
it
in
the
real
x-men
films
.
they
make
it
painfully
clear
that
the
normies
have
all
the
weapons
control
of
society
etc
etc
so
the
only
thing
saving
the
mutants
from
doom
is
their
powers
.
a
good
director
like
bryan
singer
or
matthew
vaughn
knows
you
do
not
take
it
for
granted
that
an
audience
knows
or
understands
things
like
that
.
hell
a
vaguely
competent
directly
knows
not
to
take
it
for
granted
.
so
i
submit
to
you
that
in
the
hands
of
a
good
director
the
audience
would
have
known
that
darth
maul
is
the
force
equivalent
of
bruce
lee
and
qui-gonobi-wan
are
the
equivalent
of
newly-minted
black
belts
.
in
that
context
the
audience
should
have
been
surprised
that
qui-gon
lasted
for
as
long
as
he
did
.
everyone
can
chew
me
out
at
their
leisure
for
saying
it
but
the
things
lucas
_did
not_
explicitly
spell
out
on
the
screen
such
as
mauls
true
ability
or
the
operational
physics
of
lightsabres
are
what
seals
him
as
an
incompetent
dickhead
not
what
he
_did_
put
on
the
screen
.
alex
lee
this
would
not
negate
the
fact
that
all
three
participants
in
the
duel
violate
the
first
rule
of
fencing
and
do
so
repeatedly
.
that
is
never
show
your
opponent
your
back
this
is
why
theres
no
tension
in
the
fight
.
im
just
judging
it
based
on
what
is
presentedbut
many
people
such
as
the
nostalgia
critic
just
think
its
a
kick-ass
sword
fight
when
it
really
isnt
.
andrew
thompson
am
i
the
only
one
who
made
their
own
lightsaber
.
but
now
wants
to
shove
it
up
georges
arse
andrew
thompson
shame
you
didnt
make
that
comment
10
years
ago
when
the
character
was
invented..
dean
mcintosh
there
is
also
a
funny
little
detail
that
lucas
invalidated
with
his
eu
is
not
canon
edict
that
says
lightsabres
cosmetically
relate
to
personal
history
.
if
you
look
at
qui-gons
older
obi-wans
and
lukes
rotj
lightsabres
you
notice
they
have
a
lot
in
common
.
the
same
is
true
of
anakinsvaders
lightsabres
next
to
yodas
.
but
i
digress
.
i
am
probably
the
only
person
who
took
any
notice
of
that
whilst
watching
tpm
or
any
prequel
at
the
premieres
.
the
fact
that
i
took
notice
of
it
during
these
duels
says
a
lot
about
me
and
the
duels
.
heh
.
probably
the
moment
that
came
off
the
worst
for
me
in
the
naboo
duel
however
was
when
maul
awkwardly
balances
himself
on
the
edge
of
a
platform
blocks
both
of
his
opponents
at
once
then
backflips
onto
a
path
that
has
got
to
be
at

i
mean
the
other
shots
in
the
duel
i
can
sort
of
at
least
understand
as
having
some
form
of
purpose
or
progression
within
the
fight
.
but
that
one
why
did
anyone
bother
http
noooooooooooooo
i
need
a

every

notice
another
great
detail
.
last
viewing

this
time
it
was

examines
a

alien
that
looks
exactly
like
him
.
although
my
long-time
favorite
is
the
quote
at

.
its
like
a
terrible
willaim
carlos
willaims
poem
.
will
you
defer
your
motion
to
allow
a
comission
to
explore
the
validity
of
your
accusations
chuwii
this
is
the
most
confusing
movie
ive
ever
seen
i
still
dont
know
what
the
fuck
it
is
actually
about
the
only
way
i
can
get
through
it
without
my
brain
collapsing
in
on
itself..
is
watchin
these
reviews
http
worse
the
second
just
adds
to
the
complexity
and
inanity
.
i
left
a
second
screening
of
the
attack
of
the
clones
thinking
i
actually
had
figured
out
what
the
point
was
.
but
i
was
damned
if
i
was
going
to
watch
that
dreck
a
third
time
.
i
never
saw
the
final
one
more
than
once
and
i
am
pretty
sure
ive
seen
each
of
the
original
movies
a
dozen
times
.
bigp
ive
fucked
up
mashed
potatoes
once
.
cause
i
was
a
little
shit
and
didnt
read
the
directions
to
it
so
i
added
too
much
water
.
sisyphus
no
wonder
the
droids
got
cut
apart
they
were
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
hell
that
meant
.
ikdks
whos
that
other
guy
the
guy
in
the
interview
section
.
the
guy
that
says
i
cant
answer
that
and
you
know
it
http
yes
.
bigp
it
was
the
only
bag
of
mix
i
had
.
but
youre
right
.
donald
i
hope
jj
has
watched
this
review
nomsheep
probably
because
he
didnt
attempt
to
answer
and
just
said
i
see
what
youre
doing
there
trash
boat
ive
watched
this
movie
like
twice
and
i
still
cant
understand
what
the
fuck
is
going
on
in
it
its
boring
and
doesnt
hold
the
viewer
at
all
.
im
glad
im
not
the
only
one
.
i
cant
believe
this
is
aimed
at
children
what
kid
in
their
right
mind
cares
about
space
taxes
and
trade
disputes
i
love
star
wars
but
it
literally
lost
the
plot
with
this
http
i
agree
with
most
of
what
you
wrote
here
and
think
you
did
a
good
job
in
making
your
arguments
.
i
do
disagree
with
your
final
argument
in
a
small
way
.
the
reason
why
the
duel
in
empire
works
is
because
we
know
that
vader
is
a
powerful
and
corrupt
character
and
that
luke
is
essentially
an
up-and-comer
.
they
never
made
this
statement
in
the
movie
yet
the
audience
knows
this
without
it
being
spelled
out
.
vader
uses
the
force
to
choke
a
commanding
officer
to
death
in
front
of
another
officer
while
hes
promoting
him
to
the
position
of
the
man
whos
literally
dying
next
to
him
.
this
wasnt
for
laughs
this
was
to
drive
home
what
the
stakes
are
and
who
vader
is
his
power
and
willingness
to
utilize
it
.
this
also
informs
the
audience
that
hes
in
control
now
and
theres
no
grand
moff
tarkin
to
pull
the
leash
on
him
.
and
were
reminded
of
this
when
another
commander
loses
track
of
the
falcon
goes
to
apologist
and
is
killed
for
his
efforts
.
when
you
see
luke
struggle
to
maintain
control
over
the
objects
hes
levitating
while
his
mind
is
flooded
with
images
of
his
friends
enduring
a
lot
of
pain
we
know
that
hes
not
as
powerful
as
vader
and
the
audience
wonders
how
hes
going
to
overcome
this
challenge
.
in
the
phantom
menance
in
order
for
the
fight
scene
in
the
end
to
matter
i
would
have
shown
the
jedis
sparring
with
each
other
.
jin
dueling
another
jedi
whos
clearly
better
and
is
a
step
faster
.
kenobis
sparring
with
a
fourth
jedi
and
is
dispatched
even
faster
.
they
dont
even
need
to
say
anything
cute
like
youre
training
him
your
student
is
in
trouble
.
later
these
two
jedis
shown
in
additional
scenes
as
the
plot
progresses
and
is
shown
to
be
the
prefered
pairing
to
send
on
missions
are
attacked
and
defeated
by
darth
horn
head
.
you
dont
need
to
spell
it
out
but
you
do
have
to
show
the
audience
that
horn
head
is
proficient
in
defeating
multiple
adversaries
simultaneously
.
theres
a
lot
more
detail
that
can
be
added
here
like
showing
kenobis
youth
and
energy
by
wanting
to
continue
sparring
while
jin
stops
him
from
over-excreting
himself
showing
the
other
two
jedi
accomplishing
something
else
between
the
spars
and
their
deaths
to
reinforce
the
idea
that
their
victories
were
not
flukes
but
in
order
to
save
the
phantom
menace
you
pretty
much
need
to
rip
the
entire
story
into
shreds
and
start
over
as
if
it
didnt
exist
.

naboo
chaynosaur
is
no
one
else
deeply
disturbed
by
the
creepy
murderer
joke
that
seems
to
be
happening
during
a
completely
intelligent
review
the
third
archon
its
a
part
of
the
whole
character
of
mr.
plinkettits
very
dark
yes
and
very
hilarious
if
you
are
twisted
and
into
dark
humor
.
otherwise
theres

the

you
know
another
way
they
could
have
saved

occurred
to
me
recentlyso
qui-gon
booze
puts
up
anakins
pod-racer
against
anakins
freedom
well
he
influences
the
die
roll
to
make
it
anakins
freedom
.
but
in
a
bet
ordinarily
and
in
this
case
winner
takes
allso
they
actually
still
had
the
pod
and
anakins
freedom
.
in
fact
theres
even
a
scene
where
anakin
runs
to
his
mom
all
excited
like
look
at
all
the
money
we
got
from
selling
the
pod
which
begs
the
questionwhy
couldnt
they
have
bough
her
with
that
money
or
by
trading
the
pod
watto
seemed
willing
to
trade
a
pod
for
a
singe
slavebeing
recently
destitute
probably
only
would
make
him
more
willing
to
take
a
big
sack
of
cash
for

who
again
serves
what
purpose
to
watto
exactly
cleaning
her
own

mr.
plinkett
would
say
xd
if
its
not
quite
enough
would
the
queens
wardrobe
mentioned
as
another
item
of
value
in
their
possession
earlier
have
been
enough
to
make
up
the
difference
oh
but
then
the
queen
wouldnt
have
been
able
to
dress
in
so
many
riveting
costumes
.
oh
but
then
if
that
had
worked
anakin
wouldnt
have
been
able
to
have
visions
of
his
mother
being
kidnapped
and
raped
by
sand
people
and
then
murdered
a
whole

of
them

http
the

.
https
it
can
be
found
on
scribt
jim
raynor
the
online
name
of
the
guy
who
wrote
the
108
page
response
makes
a
few
valid
points
i
actually
agree
with
him
that
qui
gon
jin
is
a
slightly
stronger
character
that
what
rlm
gives
him
credit
for
and
i
can
see
what
lucas
was
going
for
with
him
.
but
many
of
his
arguments
arestretching
it
shall
we
say
especially
when
he
tries
to
defend
padmãs
character
.
raynor
glosses
over
the
fact
that
qui-gon
really
doesnt
have
any
a.
emotional
arc
b.
personal
development
of
any
kind
and
c.
any
actual
stake
in
the
plot
.
hes
nowhere
near
strong
enough
to
carry
the
movie
by
himself
and
he
dies
at
the
end
anyway
and
is
only
mentioned
a
few
times
in
passing
.
in
many
other
cases
raynor
evades
or
misrepresents
rlms
points
.
consider
the
following
paragrah
440
plinkett
so
the
trade
federation
have
set
up
a
blockade
around
naboo
in
order
to
stop
them
from
getting
space
supplies
.
which
instantly
causes
some
kind
of
crisis
that
we
never
see
screech
stopok
i
dont
get
it
.
one
praise
for
the
rlm
review
that
ive
seen
on
various
message
boards
is
how
well-
edited
the
video
is
.
however
these
editing
tricks
are
annoying
and
embarrassing
when
used
to
draw
attention
to
points
that
are
just
plain
stupid
and
wrong
.
heres
an
example
of
it
.
stoklasa
screeches
the
sound
to
a
stop
as
if
hes
making
some
kind
of
clever
point
here
when
in
fact
hes
not
.
seriously
he
doesnt
seem
to
understand
why
a
blockade
would
cause
a
crisis
and
asks
what
that
crisis
is
as
if
theres
some
kind
of
story
that
needs
to
be
told
about
it
.
this
is
simply
unbelievable
.
a
blockade
shuts
down
trade
as
he
points
out
.
that
obviously
hurts
a
society
and
at
the
very
least
a
military
blockade
is
a
violation
of
their
sovereignty
.
raynor
here
is
evading
rlms
main
point
is
that
we
never
actually
see
the
effects
of
the
trade
federations
actions
on
naboo
despite
them
being
an
important
driving
element
of
the
plot
.
we
constantly
hear
how
padmãs
people
are
dying
and
how
the
situation
is
so
dire
on
naboo
but
we
never
see
any
of
this
at
all
.
in
fact
we
never
see
a
single
naboo
citizen
at
all
except
a
few
pilots
and
officials
.
this
aspect
of
the
movie
could
and
should
have
been
handled
better
but
in
the
end
it
turned
into
such
a
wasted
opportunity
.
also
the
rebuttal
is
filled
with
excessive
nitpicking
which
is
something
raynor
accuses
rlm
of
doing
and
a
rather
nasty
amount
of
ad-hominem
attacks
.
this
is
notable
because
later
raynor
complains
about
rlm
employing
smear
tactics
and
character
assasination
against
lucas
.
ireth
oh
dude
for
sake
of
all
thats
good
and
pure
enough
with

some

some
is

the

that

as
you

everyone
wants

with

and
pretend
that
everything

also
i
was
merely
pointing
out
the
irony
in
your
comment
not
so
much
that
you
spelled
the
word
incorrectly
.
it
make
sense
that
if
youre
going

have
the

call

retarded
you
should
at

get
the

correct

while
also
throwing
in
some
self-deprecating
and
self-aware
humour
in
to
boot
.
on
top
of
that
i
agreed
with
their

being
one
of
the
5
current

i
acknowledged
i
was
being

perhaps
they

might
learn
the
difference
between
the
two
expressions

whats
creepy
about
it
yodgonbooze
the
idea
of
a
slave
boy
is
good
but
we
first
meet
him
in
a
shop
and
we
only
learn
that
he
is
a
slave
by
him
telling
us
at
the
dinner
table
sitting
next
to
his
mom
which
is
boring
so
i
didnt
even
catch
when
he
does
say
we
got
something
in
our
brain
and
it
goes
boom
or
some
shit
i
still
cant
swear
on
a
bible
i
know
what
he
says
to
this
day
because
him
saying
it
in
that
context
of
dinner
with
mom
doesnt
hit
try
this
lucas..
first
we
are
with
liam
neeson
and
company
he
forbodes
were
are
going
is
a
dangerous
place
and
then
we
cut
to
the
town
where
we
see
little
annie
the
slave
boy
being
whipped
from
behind
to
clean
the
street
faster
and
his
mom
looking
on
coughing
and
sick
and
hungry
and
annies
owner
bossing
her
about
then
we
cut
to
liam
neeson
and
he
gives
a
grimace
look
like
yeah
that
sux
in
that
five
seconds
i
would
care
about
annie
where
as
in
the
phantom
menace
i
never
did
earth
everything
in
the
original
star
wars
trilogy
is
from
the
perspective
of
c3po
and
r2d2
.
the
only
time
i
can
remember
them
not
being
present
is
lukes
confrontation
with
the
emperor
in
jedi
.
the
point
is
they
always
follow
the
action
.
this
is
where
the
phantom
menace
completely
fucked
up
by
not
having
us
start
with
the
two
droids
its
like
poetry
its
sort
of
they
rhyme
.
we
should
have
seen
c3po
and
r2d2
being
servants
for
the
queen
of
naboo
or
whatever
when
the
droid
army
attacks
making
us
actually
give
a
shit
about
the
people
being
invaded
.
whereas
in
star
wars
princess
leia
is
captured
queen
amidala
couldve
been
rescued
by
the
suddenly
appearing
jedi
showing
us
how
jedi
acted
as
the
guardians
of
peace
and
justice
in
the
old
republic
.
sadly
no
instead
we
have
to
sit
through
an
hour
of
jedi
talking
in
a
boring
space
station
meeting
boring
villains
then
flying
down
to
the
planet
and
meeting
a
cartoon
rabbit
and..god
its
just
so
stupid
.
halo4life
sadly
i
have
all
of
those
toys
.
i
have
toys
from
all
three
of
the
prequels
.
i
have
fond
memories
of
them
from
when
i
was
a
child
so
no
chance
in
hell
would
i
actually
go
back
and
watch
them
and
realize
how
shitty
the
probably
are
.
however
the
original
trilogy
is
far
and
away
my
favorite
and
always
has
been
so
dont
worry
for
my
sanity
.
goliath
thank
you
so
much
for
introducing
this
into
my
life
.

lawra
weltreich
who
is
the
guy
in
the
right
lower
corner
at
651
i
know
ive
seen
him
but
i
dont
know
where
and
its
driving
me
crazy
jasonxzero
i
believe
that
is
brian
posehn
a
comedian
and
actor
.
lawra
weltreich
im
a
fan
of
posehn
and
thats
not
him
jasonxzero
thats
why
i
said
i
belive
i
wasnt
sure
and
this
guy
looks
a
lot
like
him
.
it
was
an
honest
mistake
i
probably
should
have
figured
that
these
guys
wouldnt
know
him
.
since
it
isnt
him
i
have
no
idea
who
that
guy
is
where
do
you
think
you
know
him
from
eev
schurink
are
you
trolling
if
you
honestly
dont
know
its
jack
packard
.
he
is
the
bald
dude
from
rlms
best
of
the
worst
and
pre-rec
.
lawra

a
beard
and

idiot
tom
gattenhof

jack
packard
from
pre-rec

the
best
of

worst
videos

hair
.
darknstormy
when
you
have
enough
money
power
to
do
anything
nobody
on
your
pay
role
is
going
to
argue
with
you
especially
if
you
at
the
time
were
considered
one
of
the
gods
of
film
.
http
theres
just
so
much
wrong
with
this
movie
that
its
impossible
to
cover
all
of
it
even
in
a
70
min
.
review
.
you
can
talk
about
all
the
major
things
but
then
when
you
get
right
down
to
it
even
seemingly
minor
issues
turn
out
to
have
major
implications
.
take
the
bongo
ride
through
the
planet
core
for
example
.
i
get
that
in
science
fantasy
like
star
wars
you
have
to
suspend
your
disbelief
a
little
but
like
plinkett
says
in
the
episode
ii
review
you
cant
stretch
the
rules
of
reality
too
far
or
it
becomes
ridiculous
.
first
of
all
to
get
down
far
enough
to
even
reach
the
planets
crust
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
the
bongo
would
have
to
be
able
to
withstand
enormous
amounts
of
pressure
as
would
the
people
inside
of
it
.
next
you
have
the
issue
of
not
only
having
to
dig
a
tunnel
through
the
center
of
the
planet
in
order
to
make
this
kind
of
travel
possible
but
actually
then
traveling
through
it
.
this
only
works
if
the
entire
planet
has
no
molten
layers
or
a
core
that
is
extremely
hot
and
extremely
pressurized
.
so
you
could
argue
that
naboo
is
an
entirely
cool
solid
chunk
of
rock
except
for
the
fact
that
a
hot
core
is
actually
necessary
to
maintain
a
magnet
field
around
the
planet
and
support
life
.
considering
again
the
fact
that
it
also
makes
no
sense
for
the
droid
army
to
even
land
on
the
other
side
of
the
planet
from
their
target
youd
think
that
if
lucas
was
really
dead-set
on
them
meeting
the
gungans
and
taking
a
secret
underwater
craft
to
get
to
the
city
hed
just
have
the
underwater
city
be
off
the
coast
of
theed
or
something
.
and
besides
all
that
science
stuff
why
would
the
gungans
have
this
planet
core
passage
that
leads
directly
to
theed
anyway
since
they
dont
exactly
seem
to
get
along
with
the
humans
on
the
planet
very
well
why
would
they
even
want
or
need
that
my
only
guess
is
that
they
wanted
to
connect
with
another
gungan
settlement
on
the
other
side
of
the
planet
but
we
never
see
or
hear
about
one
.
i
dont
know
this
is
a
film
for
babies
so
maybe
its
supposed
to
appeal
to
the
kid
in
all
of
us
who
thought
theyd
end
up
in
china
if
they
dug
a
hole
deep
enough
in
the
backyard
or
something
.
http
my
guess
is
that
hand
motions
just
make
it
easier
youd
probably
have
to
concentrate
a
lot
harder
to
move
things
with
your
mind
without
it
.
even
in
the
originals
we
see
it
done
both
ways
luke
is
able
to
levitate
c-3po
while
his
hands
are
tied
but
we
also
see
yoda
using
his
hand
when
lifting
the
x-wing
out
of
the
swamp
and
vader
almost
always
holds
out
his
hand
when
doing
a
force-choke
.
also
the
little
hand
waves
serve
as
an
easy
visual
clue
to
the
audience
that
the
force
is
being
used
plus
i
think
it
was
also
a
callback
to
the
handwave
obi-wan
did
when
he
used
the
mind
trick
in
a
new
hope
.
http
i
think
the
point
he
was
trying
to
make
was
not
that
the
ship
gets
damaged
again
after
the
shield
is
fixed
but
that
no
one
even
appears
to
fire
on
them
again
.
the
shots
wouldve
been
deflected
true
but
ultimately
the
shield
still
does
nothing
because
right
after
its
fixed
they
fly
away
without
being
attacked
again
which
dissolves
all
the
tension
in
the
scene.
