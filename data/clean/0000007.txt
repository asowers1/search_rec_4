''
it
was
the
best
of
times
it
was
the
worst
of
times
''
charles
dickens
writes
in
the
opening
lines
of
a
tale
of
two
cities
as
he
paints
a
picture
of
life
in
england
and
france
.
the
year
is
late
1775
and
jarvis
lorry
travels
from
london
to
paris
on
a
secret
mission
for
his
employer
tellson
's
bank
.
joining
him
on
his
journey
is
lucie
manette
a
17-year-old
woman
who
is
stunned
to
learn
that
her
father
doctor
alexandre
manette
is
alive
and
has
recently
been
released
after
having
been
secretly
imprisoned
in
paris
for
18
years
.
when
mr.
lorry
and
lucie
arrive
in
paris
they
find
the
doctor
's
former
servant
ernest
defarge
caring
for
him
.
defarge
now
runs
a
wine-shop
with
his
wife
in
the
poverty-stricken
quarter
of
saint
antoine
.
defarge
takes
mr.
lorry
and
lucie
to
the
garret
room
where
he
is
keeping
doctor
manette
warning
them
that
the
doctor
's
years
in
prison
have
greatly
changed
him
.
thin
and
pale
doctor
manette
sits
at
a
shoemaker
's
bench
intently
making
shoes
.
he
barely
responds
to
questions
from
defarge
and
mr.
lorry
but
when
lucie
approaches
him
he
remembers
his
wife
and
begins
to
weep
.
lucie
comforts
him
and
that
night
mr.
lorry
and
lucie
take
him
to
england
.
five
years
later
the
porter
for
tellson
's
bank
jerry
cruncher
takes
a
message
to
mr.
lorry
who
is
at
a
courthouse
.
mr.
lorry
has
been
called
as
a
witness
for
the
trial
of
charles
darnay
a
frenchman
accused
of
being
a
spy
for
france
and
the
united
states
.
also
at
the
trial
are
doctor
manette
and
lucie
who
are
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
.
doctor
manette
has
fully
recovered
and
has
formed
a
close
bond
with
his
daughter
.
if
found
guilty
of
treason
darnay
will
suffer
a
gruesome
death
and
the
testimony
of
an
acquaintance
john
barsad
and
a
former
servant
roger
cly
seems
sure
to
result
in
a
guilty
verdict
.
questions
from
darnay
's
attorney
mr.
stryver
indicate
that
cly
and
barsad
are
the
real
spies
but
the
turning
point
in
the
trial
occurs
when
sydney
carton
stryver
's
assistant
points
out
that
carton
and
darnay
look
alike
enough
to
be
doubles
.
this
revelation
throws
into
doubt
a
positive
identification
of
darnay
as
the
person
seen
passing
secrets
and
the
court
acquits
darnay
.
after
the
trial
darnay
carton
and
stryver
begin
spending
time
at
the
manette
home
obviously
attracted
to
lucie
's
beauty
and
kind
nature
.
stryver
decides
to
propose
to
her
but
is
dissuaded
by
mr.
lorry
.
carton
confesses
his
love
to
lucie
but
does
not
propose
knowing
that
his
drunken
and
apathetic
way
of
life
is
not
worthy
of
her
.
however
he
vows
that
he
would
gladly
give
his
life
to
save
a
life
she
loved
and
lucie
is
moved
by
his
sincerity
and
devotion
.
eventually
it
is
darnay
whose
love
lucie
returns
and
the
two
marry
with
doctor
manette
's
uneasy
blessing
.
while
the
couple
is
on
their
honeymoon
the
doctor
suffers
a
nine-day
relapse
of
his
mental
incapacity
and
believes
he
is
making
shoes
in
prison
again
.
