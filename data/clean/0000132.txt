at

the
studio
was
dubious
about
the
idea
's
commercial
prospects
but
hoping
for
a
long
term
relationship
with
cameron
they
gave
him
a
greenlight.8915
cameron
convinced
fox
to
promote
the
film
based
on
the
publicity
afforded
by
shooting
the
titanic
wreck
itself47
and
organized
several
dives
to
the
site
over
a
period
of
two
years.43
``
my
pitch
on
that
had
to
be
a
little
more
detailed
''
said
cameron
.
``
so
i
said
'look
we
've
got
to
do
this
whole
opening
where
they
're
exploring
the
titanic
and
they
find
the
diamond
so
we
're
going
to
have
all
these
shots
of
the
ship
.
''
cameron
stated
``
now
we
can
either
do
them
with
elaborate
models
and
motion
control
shots
and
cg
and
all
that
which
will
cost
x
amount
of
money
â
or
we
can
spend
x
plus
30
per
cent
and
actually
go
shoot
it
at

``
45
the
crew
shot
at
the
real
wreck
in
the
atlantic
ocean
twelve
times
in
1995
and
actually
spent
more
time
with
the
ship
than
its
passengers
.
at
that
depth
with
a
water
pressure
of
6000
pounds
per

inch
``
one
small
flaw
in
the

's

would
mean

death
for

not
only
were
the
dives
high-risk
but
adverse
conditions
prevented
cameron
from
getting
the
high
quality
footage
that
he
wanted.9
during
one
dive
one
of
the
submersibles
collided
with
titanicâ'âs
hull
damaging
both
sub
and
ship
and
leaving
fragments
of
the
submersible
's
propeller
shroud
scattered
around
the
superstructure
.
the
external
bulkhead
of
captain
smith
's
quarters
collapsed
exposing
the
interior
.
the
area
around
the
entrance
to
the
grand
staircase
was
also
damaged.48
descending
to
the
actual
site
made
both
cameron
and
crew
want
``
to
live
up
to
that
level
of
reality
...
.
but
there
was
another
level
of
reaction
coming
away
from
the
real
wreck
which
was
that
it
was
n't
just
a
story
it
was
n't
just
a
drama

he
said
.
``
it
was
an
event
that
happened
to
real
people

really
died

working
around
the
wreck
for
so
much

you
get
such
a
strong
sense
of
the
profound
sadness
and
injustice
of
it
and
the
message
of
it
.

cameron
stated
``
you
think
'there

to
do

.15
after
filming
the
underwater
shots
cameron
began
writing
the
screenplay.47
he
wanted
to
honor
the
people
who
died
during
the
sinking
so
he
spent
six
months
researching
all
of
the
titanicâ'âs
crew
and
passengers.43
``
i
read
everything
i
could

i
created
an
extremely
detailed

of

few
days

a
very
detailed
timeline
of
the
last
night
of
its
life

he
said.45
``
and
i
worked
within
that
to

got
some
historical

analyze

i
'd
written

comment
on

i
adjusted

45

paid
meticulous
attention
to
detail

including
a
scene
depicting
the

in
titanicâ'âs
demise
though
this
was
later

from
the
beginning
of
the

they
had
``
a

of
what
happened
on

had
a

``
45
cameron
felt
the
titanic

was
``

that

would
be
the
most
engaging

mourn

he

cameron

entirely
.

scenes
were

account
of

cameron
's
film
was
the
second
titanic
film
to
show
the
ship
breaking
in
half
after
the
1996
television
movie
titanic
.
an
enclosed
5000000
us
gallons
19000000
l
tank
was
used
for
sinking
interiors
in
which
the

the

unexpectedly
the

ripped
the

from
its
steel-reinforced
foundations
although
no

was
hurt

the

exterior
of
the
rms
titanic
had
its
first
half
lowered
into
the

but
being
the

part
of
the
ship
meant
it
acted
as
a
shock
absorber
against
the
water
to
get
the
set
into
the
water
cameron
had
much
of
the

emptied
and
even
smashed
some
of
the
promenade

himself
.
after
submerging
the
dining
saloon
three
days
were
spent
shooting
lovett

rov
traversing
the

were
shot
in

where
the
frozen

were
created
by
applying
a
powder
on
actors
that
crystallized
when
exposed
to
water
and
wax
was
coated
on
hair
and

the
climactic
scene
which
features
the
breakup
of
the
ship
directly
before
it
sinks
as
well
as
its
final
plunge
to
the
bottom
of
the
atlantic
involved
a
tilting
full-sized
set
150
extras
and
100
stunt
performers
.
cameron
criticized
previous
titanic
films
for
depicting
the
final
plunge
of
the
liner
as
sliding
gracefully
underwater
.
he
``
wanted
to
depict
it
as
the
terrifyingly
chaotic
event
that
it
really
was
''

when
carrying
out
the
sequence
people
needed
to
fall
off
the
increasingly
tilting
deck
plunging
hundreds
of
feet
below
and
bouncing
off
of
railings
and
propellers
on
the
way
down
.
a
few
attempts
to
film
this
sequence
with
stunt
people
resulted
in
some
minor
injuries
and
cameron
halted
the
more
dangerous
stunts
.
the
risks
were
eventually
minimized
``
by
using
computer
generated
people
for
the
dangerous
falls
''
.9
editingedit
there
was
one
``
crucial
historical
fact
''
cameron
chose
to
omit
from
the
film
â
the
ship
that
was
close
to
the
titanic
but
had
turned
off
its
radio
for
the
night
and
did
not
hear
their
sos
calls
.
``
yes
the
ss
californian
.
that
was
n't
a
compromise
to
mainstream
filmmaking
.
that
was
really
more
about
emphasis
creating
an
emotional
truth
to
the
film
''
stated
cameron
.
he
said
there
were
aspects
of
retelling
the
sinking
that
seemed
important
in
pre
and
post-production
but
turned
out
to
be
less
important
as
the
film
evolved
.
``
the
story
of
the
californian
was
in
there
we
even
shot
a
scene
of
them
switching
off
their
marconi
radio
set
''
said
cameron
.
``
but
i
took
it
out

it
was
a
clean

is
powerful
as
a
metaphor
as
a
microcosm
for
the
end
of

world
in

sense
then
that
world
must
be
self-contained

``

during
the
first

cameron
altered
the
planned
ending
which
had
given
resolution
to
brock
lovett

in
the
original

of
the

brock
and
lizzy
see
the
elderly
rose
at
the
stern
of
the
boat
and
fear
she
is
going
to
commit
suicide
.
rose
then
reveals
that
she
had
the
``
heart

the
ocean
''
diamond
all
along
but
never
sold
it
in
order
to
live
on
her
own

she
tells
brock
that
life
is
priceless
and
throws
the
diamond
into
the
ocean
after
allowing
him
to
hold
it
.
after
accepting
that
treasure
is
worthless
brock
laughs
at
his
stupidity
.
rose
then
goes
back
to
her
cabin
to
sleep
whereupon
the
film
ends
in
the
same
way
as
the
final
version
.
in
the

cameron
decided
that
by
this
point
the
audience
would
no

be
interested
in

lovett

cut
the
resolution
to
his
story
so
that
rose
is
alone
when
she
drops
the
diamond
.
he
also
did
not

to
disrupt
the
audience
's
melancholy
after

the

star
pattern
including
the

way
adjusted
for
the
location
in
the
north
atlantic
ocean
in

1912
.
the
change
was
prompted
by
astrophysicist
neil
degrasse
tyson
who
had
criticized
the
scene
for
showing
an
unrealistic
star
pattern
.
he
agreed
to
send
film
director
cameron
a
corrected
view
of
the
sky
which
was
the
basis
of
the
new
scene.151
an

he
wrote
``
for

the

pretty
much

''
in
regards
to
the
3d
effects
he
noted
the
``
careful
conversion
to
3d
lends
volume
and
impact
to
certain
moments
...
but
in
separating
the
foreground
and
background
of
each
scene
the
converters
have
carved
the
visual
field
into
discrete
not
organic
levels
.
``

ann
hornaday
for
the
washington
post
found
herself
asking
``
whether
the
film
's
twin
values
of
humanism
and
spectacle
are
enhanced
by
cameron
's
3-d
conversion
and
the
answer
to
that
is
they
are
n't
.
''
she
further
added
that
the
``
3-d
conversion
creates
distance
where
there
should
be
intimacy
not
to
mention
odd
moments
in
framing
and
composition
