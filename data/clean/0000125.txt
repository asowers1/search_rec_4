that
the
rda

mine
the
extremely
valuable
mineral

a
female
naâvi
named
neytiri
zoe

rescues
him
and
kills
several
of
the
viperwolves
before
they
all
flee

neytiri
is
at
first
angry
with
jake
for
having
caused
her
to
kill
the
viperwolves
needlessly
and
leaves
him
.
jake
goes
after
neytiri
who
tells
him
not
to
follow
as
she
knows
he
is
an
avatar
hybrid
-
a
dreamwalker
from
the
sky
people
.
jake
is
caught
by
her
fellow
naâvi
but
neytiri
defuses
the
situation
by
telling
her
people
that
she
witnessed
him
being
chosen
by
the
seeds
of
eywa
a
spiritual
entity

jake
presents
himself
as
a
warrior
``
dreamwalker
''
a
term
the
naâvi
used
to
call
the
avatar
hybrids
with
his
intention
to
learn
from
them
.
eytukan
and
moâat
agree
to
teach
jake
making
a
reluctant
neytiri
his
tutor
.
from
that
day
on
jake
spends
his
time
learning
the
ways
and
culture
of
the
naâvi
warriors
while
jumping
back
to
his
original
human
body
to
report
to
parker
and
quaritch
on
information
regarding
the
aliens
.
grace
arranges
the
movement
of
the
avatar
team
to
a
remote
camp
in
the
hallejuiah
mountains
after
finding
out
from
dr.
max
patel
that
jake
has
been
having
regular
communications
with
quaritch
about
the
na'vi
.
in
his
avatar
form
jake
learns
how
to
bond
and
control
his
flying
mountain
banshee
while
gaining
respect
and
admiration
from
the
naâvi
his
relationship
with
neytiri
continuing
to
grow
but
also
earning
the
jealousy
and
annoyance
of
tsu'tey
laz
alonso
neytiriâs
betrothed
and
next
in
line
to
be
the
clan
leader
.
reporting
back
to
quaritch
the
colonel
wants
jake
to
begin
his
plan
to
convince
the
tribe
to
leave
the
hometree
but
jake
is
now
reluctant
and
weary
of
his
fellow
humans
to
exploit
the
moonâs
resources
.
he
tells
quaritch
that
he
will
attempt
to
convince
the
tribe
once
he
is
made
part
of
the
people
a
ceremony
granting
the
greatest
honor
to
an
avatar
.
that
night
jake
undergoes
the
ceremony
where
eytukan
considers
him
as
one
of
their
own
and
made
part
of
the
people
with
grace
and
neytiri
looking
on
.
jake
is
now
part
of
the
omaticaya
clan
and
with
this
he
can
choose
his
mate
he
and
neytiri
choose
each
other
and
spend
that
night
mating
at
the
tree
of
voices
and
they
are
now
mated
for
life
.
when
jake
and
neytiri
awake
they
encounter
several
bulldozers
sent
by
the
rda
destroying
the
nearby
forests
.
in
his
attempt
to
stop
them
jake
destroys
one
of
the
machineâs
camera
arrays
.
returning
to
the
hometree
tsu'tey
confronts
him
for
mating
with
neytiri
.
before
anything
else
can
happen
jake
and
grace
are
suddenly
sent
back
to
their
human
bodies
when
soldiers
sent
by
quaritch
arrive
and
open
their
link
units
to
take
them
back
by
force
.
quaritch
and
parker
have
seen
footage
of
jake
destroying
the
bulldozerâs
cameras
and
have
checked
his
entry
logs
indicating
him
as
losing
interest
to
participate
in
the
plan
as
well
as
committing
possible
treason
.
grace
tells
an
unbelieving
parker
that
the
trees
and
plant
life
make
up
a
huge
network
which
connects
the
spiritual
consciousness
of
all
life
including
the
naâvi
and
must
not
be
destroyed
.
given
a
chance
to
attempt
a
final
plea
to
the
tribe
to
leave
their
home
jake
and
grace
return
to
their
avatar
forms
but
the
na'vi
refuse
to
listen
after
jake
reveals
he
was
sent
by
his
superiors
to
convince
them
to
move
.
they
are
bound
and
labelled
as
traitors
by
the
na'vi
who
intend
to
defend
themselves
.
a
large
strike
force
led
by
quaritch
destroys
the
hometree
firing
incendiary
rounds
that
topple
it
to
the
ground
while
killing
large
numbers
of
the
tribe
despite
their
attempts
to
retaliate
.
moâat
releases
jake
and
grace
from
their
bonds
and
pleads
them
to
save
her
tribe
.
eytukan
is
killed
in
the
destruction
leaving
neytiri
devastated
.
she
tells
jake
to
stay
away
when
he
tries
to
comfort
her
.
in
the
chaos
jake
and
grace
are
sent
back
to
their
original
bodies
to
be
placed
under
arrest
for
treason
along
with
norm
who
tried
to
stop
the
military
from
disabling
their
avatar
forms
.
trudy
chacon
rescues
the
avatar
team
from
prison
and
flies
them
to
safety
however
grace
is
shot
by
quaritch
when
he
attempts
to
stop
them
from
leaving
the
colony
.
the
team
has
the
camp
container
holding
the
avatar
transfer
pods
sent
near
the
tree
of
souls
where
the
remaining
omaticaya
tribe
has
fled
to
safety
.
jake
makes
his
intention
to
redeem
himself
in
the
eyes
of
the
naâvi
and
successfully
tames
and
controls
a
great
leonopteryx
an
enormous
flying
creature
related
to
the
banshee
making
him
the
sixth
toruk
makto
in
na'vi
history
.
jake
makes
a
plea
to
moâat
to
save
grace
from
dying
.
this
is
done
by
trying
to
have
her
consciousness
transferred
permanently
into
her
avatar
form
using
the
tree
of
souls
before
her
human
body
expires
.
however
it
is
too
late
as
grace
is
too
weak
to
be
transferred
.
before
she
passes
away
she
tells
jake
that
sheâs
seen
eywa
and
the
holy
entity
does
exist
.
following
grace
's
death
he
asks
tsuâtey
who
has
been
made
clan
leader
and
the
entire
tribe
to
stand
with
him
and
face
the
humans
.
having
earned
back
the
tribeâs
trust
jake
makes
plans
to
join
with
other
clans
to
strike
back
at
the
human
forces
.
surveying
the
naâvi
quaritch
learns
that
other
clans
have
converged
with
the
omaticaya
at
the
tree
of
souls
and
decides
to
destroy
them
and
their
holy
ground
to
put
an
end
to
their
defiance
once
and

the

neytiri
begins
to
shed

a
scene
near

james

confirmed

minutes
of

not

the

.
on
the
extended
collector
's
edition
there
is
45
minutes
of
deleted
scenes
included
as
part
of
the
collection
.
here
is
a
short
description
of
some
of
those
scenes
as
well
as
several
scenes
from
the
script
that
were
not
included
in
the
extended
collector
's
edition
stingbat
attack
jake
in
his
wheelchair
comes
near
the
fence
that
surrounds
hells
gate
staring
at
a
creature
that
resembles
a
stingbat
orange
and
has
wings
that
appear
more
bat
like
attacks
the
fence
trying
to
get
at
him
but
is
killed
by
lyle
wainfleet
.
this
is
reminiscent
of
the
scene
described
in
the
original
manuscript
where
jake
is
nearly
killed
by
a
slinth
a
creature
that
was
replaced
by
the
thanator
near
the
fence
of
hell
's
gate
.
in
the
script
trudy
chacon
and
norm
spellman
have
a
romantic
relationship
.
before
she
crashes
trudy
whispers
``
norm
i
love
you
.
''
jake
discovers
their
relationship
when
getting
out
of
a
link
finds
them
sharing
their
intimacy
in
norm
's
bunk
.
there
is
a
scene
that
takes
place
after
the
assault
on
the
tree
of
souls
where
jake
having
returned
to
his
avatar
body
finds
a
dying
tsu'tey
whose
queue
had
been
cut
off
by
lyle
wainfleet
.
tsu'tey
is
in
much
pain
and
confesses
to
jake
that
he
considered
him
to
be
a
brother
and
was
proud
to
fight
with
him
.
he
declares
jake
the
new
omaticaya
clan
leader
.
he
then
asks
jake
to
end
his
life
.
jake
reluctantly
does
so
with
a
knife
and
blesses
him
with
the
same
rite
shown
when
he
killed
his
first
hexapede
.
this
scene
was
included
as
part
of
the
extended
re-release
and
later
the
extended
collector
's
edition
but
with
minor
changes
as
tsu'tey
does
not
lose
his
queue
in
either
version
of
the
film
and
is
merely
dying
from
the
gunshot
injuries
that
he
sustained
during
the
battle
.
the
mating
scene
between
jake
and
neytiri
was
cut
short
because
james
cameron
felt
that
it
would
make
some
audience
members
feel
uncomfortable
and
so
that
the
film
would
not
get
an
``
r
''
rating
.
the
scene
was
restored
to
its
original
length
in
both
the
extended
re-release
and
the
extended
collector
's
edition
.
the
script
goes
into
greater
detail
during
the
mating
scene
.
neytiri
says
that
she
appreciates
the
kisses
of
jake
but
her
people
have
something
more
referring
to
the
connection
between
queues
.
jake
is
disturbed
because
he
understands
that
neytiri
knows
that
his
real
body
is
not
there
.
neytiri
convinces
jake
that
the
only
thing
that
is
important
is
the
presence
of
the
two
souls
.
so
jake
agrees
to
connect
queues
and
they
are
united
forever
.
after
this
jake
in
his
human
body
goes
rigid
understanding
the
depth
of
his
own
actions
.
after
months
in
the
na'vi
part
of
his
life
jake
starts
to
hate
human
food
.
this
fact
is
in
particular
shown
in
a
scene
later
added
into
the
extended
collector
's
edition
where
jake
refuses
to
eat
a
microwave-heated
burrito
a
food
considered
by
the
na'vi
in
the
script
as
``
food
for
larvae
.
''
the
dreamhunt
after
having
captured
his
ikran
jake
is
actually
an
``
adult
''
na'vi
.
the
last
rite
is
the
uniltaron
when
a
na'vi
will
discover
his
``
protective
animal
''
similar
to
rituals
in
some
native
american
cultures
.
during
the
rite
jake
sees
a
toruk
the
``
last
shadow
''
and
is
shy
about
sharing
his
vision
as
the
animal
is
considered
to
be
a
symbol
of
bad
luck
.
mo'at
decrees
that
the
vision
is
not
clear
and
that
jake
is
not
obliged
to
share
it
.
there
is
also
a
scene
in
which
jake
riding
an
ikran
hunts
for
a
sturmbeest
--
an
animal
which
is
not
featured
in
the
original
theatrical
release
of
the
film
but
is
present
in
both
the
extended
re-release
and
the
extended
collector
's
edition
.
hunt
festival
another
scene
sees
jake
and
tsu'tey
during
a
hunt
festival
engage
in
a
drinking
contest
.
tsu'tey
is
ready
to
open
himself
emotionally
to
jake
but
neytiri
interrupts
them
and
takes
jake
to
dance
with
her
angering
tsu'tey
.
while
jake
and
neytiri
dance
in
the
front
of
the
fire
tsu'tey
watches
them
jealously
.
this
is
another
sign
of
the
rivalry
between
jake
and
tsu'tey
.
this
scene
is
also
important
as
it
highlights
the
fact
that
neytiri
is
falling
in
love
with
jake
.
mo'at
and
eytukan
discuss
this
and
they
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
have
to
separate
the
two
because
neytiri
is
promised
to
tsu'tey
.
the
challenge
in
another
scene
tsu'tey
upon
learning
that
jake
and
neytiri
are
mated
for
life
challenges
jake
to
a
fight
to
the
death
.
jake
accepts
the
challenge
and
the
two
fight
with
staffs
.
the
fight
ends
when
jake
and
grace
are
returned
to
their
human
bodies
by
quaritch
and
tsu'tey
is
stopped
from
killing
jake
's
inert
avatar
by
neytiri
.
another
scene
shows
grace
telling
jake
how
her
school
closed
sylwanin
along
with
several
other
na'vi
children
had
burned
an
rda
bulldozer
and
fled
to
grace
's
school
seeking
protection
.
rda
soldiers
however
followed
the
children
to
the
school
and
opened
fire
.
despite
grace
's
best
efforts
to
keep
the
na'vi
safe
sylwanin
and
many
others
were
killed
and
grace
herself
was
shot
.
the
scene
was
added
into
the
extended
collector
's
edition
although
there
is
no
mention
of
grace
being
shot
during
the
massacre
.
following
the
destruction
of
the
tree
of
voices
by
the
rda
tsu'tey
acting
under
eytukan
's
orders
leads
a
war
party
against
them
.
the
aftermath
seen
by
quaritch
and
parker
selfridge
shows
several
bulldozers
destroyed
and
the
squad
of
mercenaries
killed
serving
as
the
decisive
moment
for
the
rda
to
destroy
the
hometree
.
this
scene
was
inserted
into
both
the
extended
re-release
and
the

he
met
with

three
times

saw
some
of

simply
came
down

that

thinking
it
was

stated
in

was
always
kind
of
channeling
him
