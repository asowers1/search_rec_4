lolita
by
vladimir
nabokov
a
review
by
charles
rolo
here
it
is
at
last
vladimir
nabokov
's
lolita
putnam
5.00
--
first
issued
in
1955
by
an
unorthodox
paris
press
after
being
rejected
by
a
string
of
american
publishers
banned
by
the
french
government
presumably
out
of
solicitude
for
immature
english-speaking
readers
the
ban
was
later
quashed
by
the
french
high
court
pronounced
unobjectionable
by
that
blue-nosed
body
the
u.
s.
customs
office
and
heralded
by
ovations
from
writers
professors
and
critics
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
.
the
novel
's
scandal-tinted
history
and
its
subject
--
the
affair
between
a
middle-aged
sexual
pervert
and
a
twelve-year-old
girl
--
inevitably
conjure
up
expectations
of
pornography
.
but
there
is
not
a
single
obscene
term
in
lolita
and
aficionados
of
erotica
are
likely
to
find
it
a
dud
.
lolita
blazes
however
with
a
perversity
of
a
most
original
kind
.
for
mr.
nabokov
has
distilled
from
his
shocking
material
hundred-proof
intellectual
farce
.
his
book
is
slightly
reminiscent
of
thomas
mann
's
confessions
of
felix
krull
but
lolita
has
a
stronger
charge
of
comic
genius
and
is
more
brilliantly
written
.
mr.
nabokov
a
russian
émigré
now
working
in
his
second
tongue
has
few
living
equals
as
a
virtuoso
in
the
handling
of
the
english
language
.
a
mock
sententious
foreword
explains
that
the
manuscript
which
follows
is
the
confession
of
one
humbert
humbert
who
died
in
captivity
in
1952
just
before
his
trial
was
due
to
start
.
humbert
introduces
himself
as
a
european
of
mixed
stock
who
at
the
age
of
twelve
``
in
a
princedom
by
the
sea
''
loved
and
lost
a
petite
fille
fatale
named
annabel
leigh
and
has
thereafter
remained
in
sexual
bondage
to
``
the
perilous
magic
''
of
subteen
sirens
--
he
calls
them
''
nymphets
.
''
there
follows
a
sketch
of
his
tortured
career
up
to
the
time
when
in
his
late
thirties
he
settles
in
a
quiet
new
england
town
an
american
uncle
has
left
him
a
legacy
and
he
dabbles
in
scholarship
under
the
same
roof
as
a
fatally
seductive
nymphet
dolores
haze
--
a
mixture
of
``
tender
dreamy
childishness
and
eerie
vulgarity
.
''
this
``
lolita
''
is
the
daughter
of
his
landlady
whom
he
marries
with
murderous
intent
.
but
an
accident
eliminates
mrs.
haze
and
humbert
the
nympholept
finds
himself
the
guardian
of
his
darling
who
on
their
first
night
together
turns
out
to
be
utterly
depraved
and
plays
the
role
of
seducer
.
their
weird
affair
--
which
carries
them
on
a
frenzied
motel-hopping
trek
across
the
american
continent
--
is
climaxed
by
lolita
's
escape
with
a
playwright
and
humbert
's
eventual
revenge
on
his
rival
.
what
is
one
to
make
of
lolita
in
a
prickly
postscript
to
the
novel
mr.
nabokov
dismisses
this
question
as
a
problem
dreamed
up
by
``
teachers
of
literature
''
he
rejects
the
satiric
interpretations
which
critics
have
put
upon
lolita
and
asserts
in
effect
that
it
is
simply
a
story
he
had
to
get
off
his
chest
.
that
all
of
this
is
too
ingenuous
by
half
is
evident
from
the
parodic
style
in
which
lolita
is
written
a
combination
of
pastiches
of
well-known
styles
spoofing
pedantry
analysis
of
passion
à
la
français
joycean
word
games
puns
and
all
kinds
of
verbal
play
.
wild
fantastic
wonderfully
imaginative
it
is
a
style
which
parodies
everything
it
touches
.
it
surely
justifies
at
least
in
part
those
critics
who
have
seen
in
lolita
a
satire
of
the
romantic
novel
of
``
old
europe
''
in
contact
with
``
young
america
''
or
of
``
chronic
american
adolescence
and
shabby
materialism
.
''
but
above
all
lolita
seems
to
me
an
assertion
of
the
power
of
the
comic
spirit
to
wrest
delight
and
truth
from
the
most
outlandish
materials
.
it
is
one
of
the
funniest
serious
novels
i
have
ever
read
and
the
vision
of
its
abominable
hero
who
never
deludes
or
excuses
himself
brings
into
grotesque
relief
the
cant
the
vulgarity
and
the
hypocritical
conventions
that
pervade
the
human
comedy
.
