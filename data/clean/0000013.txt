this
handsome
edition
of
a
much-loved
book
that
has
since
its
publication
in
1943
been
translated
into
eighty
different
languages
and
read
in
more
than
180
countries
has
been
given
added
stature
by
the
quality
of
this
new
version
.
the

and
printed
on

all
of
the
illustrations
which
are
copies
of
sainte-exupery
's
original
drawings
for
the
first
edition
have
been
done
in
ink

the
fable
is
told
in
the
first
person
by
a
narratorpilot
who
after
a
crash
landing
in
the
sahara
dessert
meets
the
little
prince
who
is
from
another
much
smaller
planet
.
as
the
two
become
friends
the
little
prince
describes
his
travels
among
other
planets
he
has
visited
and
the
people
he
has
met
who
lived
there
.
not
surprisingly
as
the
story
was
written
during
war
time
the
qualities
displayed
by
the
occupants
of
the
other
planets
include
vanity
greed
power
and
blindly
following
directions
.
the
time
covered
by
the
book
is
only
eight
days
which
is
how
long
it
takes
the
pilot
to
repair
his
plane
but
it
is
enough
time
for
the
pilot
to
come
to
care
deeply
for
the
little
prince
.
this
is
an
outstanding
book
for
an
adolescent
to
take
into
adulthood
for
an
adult
who
knew
it
and
loved
it

for
anyone
who
has

are

that
divides

''
the
exact
opposite
of
exupãry
's
pastoral
innocence
may
well
be
another
midcentury
children
's
book
for
grown-ups
or
``
precocious
adults
''
written
by
an
american
woman
.
in
kay
thompson
's
arch
hilarious
eloise
the
joy
and
humor
come
directly
out
of
seeing
a
six-year-old
girl
engage
with
all
the
worldly
pleasures
of
urban
adulthood
â
charge
cards
room
service
boxing
matches
mother
's
feathered
mules
â
at
her
disposal
.
this
horror
of
the
adult
world
seems
cruel
when
inflicted
upon
children
and
teens
just
at
the
verge
of
crossing
its
threshold
not
to
mention
generations
of
practicing
artists
who
in
exupãry
's
terms
encounter
the
dubious
choice
between
remaining
a
lifelong
child
or
switching
to
the
mba
track
.
like
many
others
who
romanticize
the
purity
of
childhood
the
boundary
for
exupãry
seems
to
be
adolescence
.
his
``
grown-ups
''
especially
in
midcentury
terms
seem
to
be
of
a
single
gender
as
well
the
grown-up
is
the
person
who
pays
the
bills
the
put-upon
patriarch
who
labors
without
any
particular
love
to
support
a
family
to
whom
he
feels
little
more
than
obligated
.
one
wonders
if
it
is
unkind
to
point
out
that
this
preoccupation
with
materialism
was
required
more
of
the
french
petite
bourgeoisie
whereas
those
of
exupãry
's
aristocratic
class
tended
to
be
encouraged
to
pursue
more
enlightened
pursuits
.
those
inclined
towards
psychoanalysis
â
another
popular
midcentury
pastime
â
might
also
point
out
that
while
exupãry
the
child
was
raised
to
believe
in
his
enlightened
future
exupãry
the
young
adult
discovered
that
his
family
's
status
was
more
material
in
name
than
in
fortune
and
thus
was
strongly
encouraged
to
rustle
up
a
few
beans
of
his
own
to
count
.
there
is
no
doubt
whatsoever
that
love
for
a
young
lady
is
the
thorn
in
our
little
prince
's
side
.
he
is
driven
off
his
home
planet
when
made
half
mad
over
the
love
of
a
flower
a
rose
described
as
vain
weak
emotionally
manipulative
``
contradictory
''
and
given
to
``
silly
pretensions
''
and
who
often
coughs
to
hide
her
lies
.
``
you
must
never
listen
to
flowers
''
confides
the
prince
.
``
you
must
look
at
them
and
smell
them
.
''
this
unflattering
portrayal
of
romantic
love
seems
even
less
appealing
when
one
considers
that
the
prince
's
rose
is
widely
considered
to
be
a
stand-in
for
exupãry
's
wife
consuelo
sunsin
a
tempestuous
beauty
from
el
salvador
like
the
prince
's
planet
home
to
three
volcanoes
whom
he
often
left
alone
during
his
travels
while
he
engaged
in
frequent
adultery
â
the
sin
so
singular
to
adulthood
it
shares
its
name
.
consuelo
was
no
shy
flower
herself
but
the
portrait
she
created
of
their
marriage
in
her
posthumous
memoir
the
tale

love
story
behind
the
little
prince
published
days
before
the
centennial
celebration
of
exupãry
's
birth
in
2000
was
damning
enough
to
put
quite
a
damper
on
the
festivities
.

the
devout
love
it
has
inspired
in
generations
of
impressionable

about
to
cross
over
into
courtships
of
their
own
le

i
adore
the
book
do
n't
like
this
translation
the
little
prince
is
a
wonderful
classic
about
life
love
making
friends
falling
in
love
finding
what
is
important
in
life
and
saying
goodbye
.
saint-exupery
's
tale
is
absolutely
charming
and
full
of
wisdom
.
i
bought
this
as
a
gift
for
a
friend
who
was
losing
a
dear
pet
.
i
still
gave
it
to
her
but
i
was
disappointed
by
this
translation
.
unfortunately
the
translation
by
richard
howard
lacks
some
of
the
heart
of
the
tale
especially
in
many
key
places
.
for
example
the
phrase
``
l'essentiel
est
invisible
pour
les
yeux
.
''
is
translated
``
anything
essential
is
invisible
to
the
eyes
.
''
instead
of
``
what
is
essential
is
invisible
to
the
eyes
.
''
or
``
the
essential
part
is
invisible
to
the
eyes
.
''
i
much
prefer
the
translation
by
katherine
woods
.

more

this

in
case
you
have
forgotten
what
is
really
important
.
my
first
encounter
with
``
the
little
prince
''
was
having
it
read
to
me
in
kindergarten
over
half
a
century
ago
.
i
received
my
first
copy
over
twenty
years
later
from
``
the
second
great
love
of
my
life
''
to
thank
me
for
opening
her
heart
.
the
tenets
set
forward
by
antoine
de
saint-exupery
stayed
with
me
and
helped
strengthen
and
nurture
relationships
over
the
decades
.
i
reminded
my
friend
of
her
gift
and
its
lessons
several
years
ago
as
she
was
dying
of
cancer
.
then
just
a
few
weeks
ago
a
new
friend
found
herself
in
the
same
position
a
former
lover
who
remained
a
close
friend
for
decades
was
dying
of
cancer
.
so
i
sent
her
a
copy
of
this
book
to
help
bring
her
some
clarity
.
perhaps
it
is
true
that
everything
you
ever
really
needed
to
know
you
learned
in
kindergarten
which
is
why
this
so-called
``
children
's
book
''
is
worth
revisiting
at
any
point
in
your
life
.

a
most
remembered
story
a
friend
told
me
about
this
book
over
25
years
ago
.
she
had
a
copy
for
me
to
read
and
she
told
me
'you
must
read
this
book
-
it
tells
about
what
is
important
in
life
.
'
i
was
sure
she
was
mistaken
-
it
looked
just
like
any
children
's
book
.
i
read
it
and
was
taught
so
much
about
life
that
i
have
never
forgotten
.
it
is
one
of
my
most-remembered
and
most-cherished
stories

this
is
the
bad
version
-
do
n't
buy
it
'the
little
prince
'
is
the
greatest
piece
of
literature
ever
written
both
in
the
original
french
version
and
the
flawless
english
translation
by
katherine
woods
.
this
'new
'
translation
is
just
pitiful
.
it
contorts
some
of
the
most
touching
moments
in
the
novel
and
defiles
exupery
's
exquisite
poignancy
.
i
'm
only
giving
it
three
stars
because
the
subject
material
is
basically
intact
.
anyway
do
n't
buy
this
new
version
buy
the
one
by
katharine
woods
you
'll
love
it
