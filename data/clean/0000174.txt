this

had

all
of
that
...
.yada
yada
yada
.
even
allowing
for
that
this
movie
is
somewhat
of
a
dissapointment

this

proves
that
it
was
n't
just
special
fx
that
made
``

fun
to
watch
.
it
was
as
if
george
lucas
was
so
thrilled
with
what
he
could
do
with
cgi

he
forgot
what
made
the

so
great
which
is
writing
and
characters
.
it
's
not
a
bad
film
but
the
problems
are
many.-many
people
have
forgiven
this
movie
for
being
lackluster
as
they
say
``
it
is
only
the
first
in
another
trilogy
and
it
is
just
setting
up
everything
to
follow
''
.
wrong
wrong
wrong
this
film
needed
to
be
it
's
own
movie
first
and
foremost
as
the
other
three
films
were
.
it
needed
to
have
good
characters
and
a
somewhat
interesting
story
...
.it
didn't.-the
conflict
in
this
story
revolves
around
a
trade
dispute
and
the
fate
of
the
planet
naboo
.
was
anybody
really
caring
about
this
the
details
of
the
dispute
are
somewhat
vague
and
what
is
revealed
does
n't
real
generate
enough
interest
for
us
to
root
for
a
particular
side
.
the
important
conflict
regarding
darth
sideous
and
his
rise
is
kept
far
far
in
the
background
.
we
do
n't
even
know
why
darth
maul
hates
the
jedi
's
so
much
...
.he
just
does
.
possibly
lucas
wanted
darth
maul
to
be
somewhat
like
boba
fett
silent
and
mysterious
.
it
worked
with
boba
fett
because
he
was
only
a
supporting
character
not
a
main
villian
.
this
film
really
has
no
clear
villian
.
i
wish
somebody
would
have
had
the
courage
and
just
told
lucas
that
his
basic
story
was
lousy.-nobody
looks
particularly
happy
in
this
film
.
qui-gon
is
really
the
only
character
that
can
be
related
to
and
even
he
is
rather
distant
.
the
queen
acts
like
a
mannequin
in
much
of
her
scenes
and
looks
like
one
to
.
obi-wan
kenobi
wanders
through
the
entire
movie
to
no
avail
and
never
says
anything
interesting
.
the
characters
never
seem
to
talk
about
anything
besides
the
plot
unlike
in
the
first
film
.
c3po
and
r2-d2
were
pretty
pointless
.
the
jedi
council
comes
across
as
extremely
cold
and
buracratic
.
and
i
will
never
understand
why
they
wrote
annakin
as
a
grade
school
kid
in
this
film
.
he
should
have
been
a
teenager
.
his
scenes
with
the
queen
were
awkward
.
we
're
not
even
going
to
discuss
jar
jar.various
other
things
...
-the
``
midochlorians
''
thing
seems
to
have
just
been
tacked
on
.
the
humor
falls
flat
unless
you
are
an
extremely
small
child
.
annakin
destroys
the
trade
ship
at
the
end
and
safves
everyone
basically
by
mistake
ilm
and
george
lucas
seem
to
be
so
happy
with
their
new
cgi
toys
that
they
spent
95
of
their
time
perfecting
them
.
quite
frankly
i
thought
the
fx
in
``
return
of
the
jedi
''
were
sharper
more
dimensional
and
less
cartoonish
.
nothing
all
that
memorable
seems
to
happen
here
.
this
movie
may
never
have
been
as
good
as
the
hype
but
it
could
have
easily
been
much
better
than
this
.
i
waited
so
long
for
this
film
yet
the
first
time
i
saw
this
movie
i
was
actually
bored
in
the
middle
of
it.there
are
good
moments
.
the
pod
race
was
fun
as
was
the
light
sabre
battle
at
the
end
.
there
are
some
very
nice
special
effects
throughout
.
hopefully
lucas
just
had
writers
block
when
he
wrote
this
one
.
maybe
he
will
remember
what
made
the
other
films
so
good
in
time
for
``
episode
ii
''
.
though
he
seems
to
have
botched
the
title
of
it
already
.
