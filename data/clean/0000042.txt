let
me
start
by
saying
that
i
loved
these
stories
as
a
child
.
i
read
``
the
lion
the
with
and
the
wardrobe
''
in
fourth
grade
as
a
part
of
class
.
i
was
reluctant
to
read
it
and
had
no
interest
school
kids
are
like
that
but
i
was
sucked
into
the
story
very
quickly
.
i
had
my
parents
buy
me
the
boxed
set
and
i
believe
i
ended
up
reading
5
of
the
7
books
.
i
absolutely
love
this
story.after
at
least
40
minutes
of
googling
i
finally
found
out
what
the
difference
between
the
``
adult
''
version
and
the
regular
version
is
.
apparently
the
``
adult
''
version
includes
some
essay
material
about
the
literature
and
each
book
contains
a
synopsis
of
information
you
'd
need
to
know
from
the
other
books
to
read
the
one
you
're
holding
.
other
than
that
only
the
packaging
is
different
.
the
stories
all
remain
the
same
.
i
only
wish
amazon.com
would
have
provided
me
this
information
and
saved
me
the
time
.

helpfulsome
orderly
observations
about
ordering
narnia
.
by
godly
gadfly
on
august
26
2001format
paperback
the
order
in
which
the
narnia
chronicles
should
be
read
and
published
is
a
matter
of
great
controversy
.
in
my
view
the
answer
to
this
question
lies
in
a
proper
understanding
of
the
deeper
level
of
narnia
.
when
read
on
an
adult
level
the
narnia
chronicles
function
as
a
powerful
medium
used
by
lewis
to
impart
powerful
spiritual
truths
about
christianity
and
theology
.
but
these
spiritual
truths
are
conveyed
more
by
biblical
allusions
than
by
rigid
allegory
.
this
also
has
implications
for
the
order
of
the
volumes
in
this
series
.
the
publishers
of
this
edition
have
elected
to
follow
the
chronological
order
of
the
series
1
.
the
magician
's
nephew
2
.
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
3
.
the
horse
and
his
boy
4
.
prince
caspian
5
.
the
voyage
of
the
dawn
treader
6
.
the
silver
chair
7
.
the
last
battle
.
the
chronological
order
makes
the
books
more
strictly
allegorical
than
they
really
were
intended
to
be
and
gives
the
impression
that
they
are
an
extended
allegory
rather
than
incidental
allusions
an
incorrect
impression
in
my
view
.
despite
all
the
talk
about
allegory
it
seems
to
me
that
lewis
is
more
fond
of
incorporating
biblical
allusions
where
and
when
he
pleases
rather
than
working
with
a
strict
and
rigid
allegory
that
tightly
binds
the
plot
.
certainly
the
central
biblical
themes
of
creation
fall
redemption
and
consummation
are
present
and
form
the
broad
chronological
coat-hanger
on
which
the
series
rests
.
but
ultimately
lewis
does
not
want
us
to
become
obsessed
with
chronology
but
with
content
.
thus
there
is
something
to
the
vehemence
with
which
so
many
readers
argue
that
the
books
must
be
read
in
the
order
in
which
they
were
first
published
namely
1
.
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
2
.
prince
caspian
3
.
the
voyage
of
the
dawn
treader
4

of
lewis
's
work
all
i
can
say
is
that
it
's
heartening
to
see
that
new
generations
are
continuing
to
discover
how
wonderful
the
chronicles
of
narnia
are
just
as
i
did
about
20
years
ago
.
it
's
also
great
to
see
how
many
adults
continue
to
treasure
them
just
as
i
do
today.the
only
thing
i
would
say
to
first-time
readers
is
the
same
thing
that
a
lot
of
other
reviewers
are
saying
do
n't
read
the
books
in
the
order
that
u.s.
publishers
are
putting
them
out
these
days
lewis
always
intended
the
narnia
books
to
be
published
and
read
in
the
order
in
which
he
wrote
them
lww
pc
vdt
sc
hhb
mn
and
lb
.
it
's
true
that
near
the
end
of
his
life
lewis
pondered
the
notion
of
having
the
books
published
and
read
in
chronological
order
--
but
only
after
an
extensive
set
of
internal
revisions.as
it
turned
out
lewis
never
had
the
chance
to
complete
those
revisions
.
so
as
they
stand
now
the
books
really
should
be
read
in
the
original
sequence
.
for
one
thing
that
's
the
only
way
for
new
readers
to
discover
narnia
in
the
way
that
lewis
himself
discovered
it
.
since
lewis
never
got
around
to
his
intended
rewriting
the
overall
story
unfolds
much
more
meaningfully
--
and
much
more
dramatically
--
when
it
's
read
out
of
order
.
for
instance
part
of
the
enjoyment
of
reading
the
magician
's
nephew
is
realizing
just
how
a
land
that
the
reader
has
already
fallen
in
love
with
actually
came
into
being
there
's
an
almost
archaeological
``
oh
now
i
understand
''
feel
to
it
.
if
you
read
mn
first
you
miss
completely
that
very
important
--
and
very
rich
--

please
note
that
this
review
concerns
only
the
new
publicationsthe
chronicles
of
narnia
are
perfect
books
.
they
are
wonderful
for
children
and
adults
and
can
be
read
again
and
again
.
c.
s.
lewis
was
a
brilliant
author
and
theologian
and
was
competent
in
what
he
was
doing
.
i
have
been
reading
these
books
since
i
was
young
enough
to
pick
up
a
book
and
i
was
horrified
when
i
found
out
they
were
reprinting
them
in
chronological
order
why
have
the
publishers
decided
to
tamper
with
the
order
reading
these
books
in
chronological
order
spoils
all
of
the
surprise
and
magic
out
of
the
first
visit
to
narnia
in
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
because
we
already
know
what
's
going
on
.
you
're
not
supposed
to
know
about
the
lightpole
or
who
the
professor
is
yet
things
do
n't
always
need
to
be
put
in
chronological
order
.
if
you
're
going
to
read
them
please
read
them
in
the
correct
order
