heâs
the
rocket
man
.
captain
fantastic
.
reginald
dwight
.
but
you
know
him
best
as
sir
elton
hercules
john
and
his
songs
are
some
of
the
best
in
classic
rock
history
.
as
he
moves
past
his
66th
birthday
march
25
2013
the
legendary
pianist
singer
and
songwriter
remains
as
stunning
and
spry
as
ever
.
johnâs
personal
peace
and
happiness
are
a
beautiful
thing
to
see
knowing
the
years
he
lost
to
wild
rock
star
living
and
a
portfolio
of
various
addictions
.
watching
him
pound
the
keys
with
his
band
at
one
of
his
regular
shows
in
las
vegas
itâs
hard
to
even
remember
the
diva
who
waddled
onto
a
stage
in
new
yorkâs
central
park
wearing
a
full
donald
duck
costume
.
but
thatâs
central
to
the
brilliance
of
elton
johnâs
art
the
contradictions
within
the
man
.
he
can
kill
you
with
the
beauty
of
a
tender
ballad
then
bowl
you
over
with
an
intense
blast
of
filthy
rock
and
roll
.
he
can
dedicate
decades
of
work
to
defeating
aids
then
engage
in
a
public
catfight
with
madonna
through
the
gossip
columns
.
ten
songs
from
elton
johnâs
career
thatâs
a
tall
order
.
your
favorite
isnât
on
here
and
neither
is
mine
.
okay
a
few
of
my
favorites
are
.
make
your
own
damn
list
.
but
like
his
many
public
personas
and
musical
identities
no
matter
which
songs
you
choose
to
love
thereâs
always
something
amazing
to
find
in
elton
johnâs
songs
.

'this
train
donât
stop
there
anymore'
from
'songs
from
the
west
coast
'
2001
although
his
modern
work
hasnât
had
the
same
impact
on
the
charts
as
his
seventies
records
elton
johnâs
put
out
a
solid
run
of
quality
albums
since
2001âs
'songs
from
the
west
coast
'
including
his
twang-infused
2004
release
'peachtree
road
'
and
the
2010
leon
russell
collaboration
'the
union
.
'
the
closing
track
from
'west
coast
'
is
one
of
bernie
taupinâs
classic
âstate
of
the
eltonâ
lyrics
where
he
illustrates
the
stages
of
his
best
friendâs
life
with
poetic
accuracy
.
it
captures
elton
john
as
the
train
of
his
life
slows
down
and
he
begins
to
appreciate
the
simple
pleasures
of
love
and
music
.
hear
''this
train
donât
stop
there
anymore'

'i
guess
thatâs
why
they
call
it
the
blues'
from
'too
low
for
zero
'
1983
one
of
a
few
elton
tunes
featuring
guest
harmonica
from
stevie
wonder
'i
guess
thatâs
why
they
call
it
the
blues
'
finds
elton
john
delivering
a
warm
slice
of
eighties
mid-tempo
pop
aided
and
abetted
by
his
own
down
and
dirty
piano
skills
.
the
manâs
one
of
musicâs
greatest
balladeers
but
this
is
something
different
this
may
be
the
closest
heâs
ever
come
to
the
straightforward
soul
music
thatâs
one
of
his
many
influences
.
hear
'i
guess
thatâs
why
they
call
it
the
blues'

'please'
from
'made
in
england
'
1995
released
in
1995
'made
in
england
'
is
a
refuge
of
organic
instrumentation
smack
in
the
middle
of
elton
johnâs
most
synth-laden
era
when
every
album
was
lathered
thick
with
electronic
bleeps
and
sighs
.
this
deep
cut
is
a
simple
love
song
with
some
of
the
sweetest
hooks
elton
ever
penned
a
beatle-esque
chiming
guitar
and
a
sly
but
sincere
taupin
lyric
.
hear
'please'
7
'crocodile
rock'
from
'do
n't
shoot
me
i
'm
only
the
piano
player
'
1973
sometimes
itâs
an
artistâs
slightest
work
that
maintains
the
greatest
staying
power
.
which
is
not
to
say
'crocodile
rock
'
isnât
a
terrific
tune
just
that
its
aspirations
are
small
.
itâs
a
song
from
the
seventies
thatâs
a
pastiche
and
homage
to
all
the
fiftiesâ
rock
pop
and
doo
wop
that
elton
john
and
his
peers
grew
up
on
.
from
that
perspective
itâs
a
rung
or
two
above
sha
na
na
.
here
the
devilâs
in
the
details
like
the
whirligig
organ
that
floats
above
eltonâs
central
piano
riff
or
the
ascending
guitar
lines
that
underpin
the
chorus
.
roger
ebert
said
that
great
parody
becomes
that
which
it
parodies
which
is
a
high-falutinâ
way
of
saying
that
on
'crocodile
rock
'
elton
didnât
just
imitate
his
idols
--
he
equaled
them
.
hear
'crocodile
rock'

'goodbye
yellow
brick
road'
from
'goodbye
yellow
brick
road
'
1973
you
could
write
an
entire
separate
piece
ranking
elton
johnâs
seventies
albums
but
one
looms
large
above
the
others
if
only
by
size
and
the
weight
of
its
many
iconic
songs
'goodbye
yellow
brick
road
.
'
if
elton
john
and
bernie
taupin
have
created
a
magnum
opus
this
may
very
well
be
it
.
while
elton
and
his
band
hopscotch
through
the
entire
history
of
american
popular
music
bernie
crafts
evocative
words
that
look
ever
backward
with
nostalgia
wit
and
occasional
anger
.
this
title
cut
captures
those
themes
perfectly
with
the
tale
of
a
green
young
farmboy
who
finds
himself
trapped
in
the
orbit
of
a
world
weary
powerful
figure
.
thereâs
something
almost
spector-esque
about
the
sound
elton
and
his
band
achieve
on
this
track
adding
an
extra
halo
of
wistful
yearning
to
the
song
.
hear
'goodbye
yellow
brick
road'

'empty
garden
hey
hey
johnny'
from
'jump
up
'
1982
elton
john
was
one
of
the
first
generation
of
musicians
to
be
deeply
influenced
by
the
beatles
not
as
peers
but
as
wide-eyed
fans
.
one
can
only
imagine
the
thrill
of
befriending
john
lennon
after
years
of
staring
at
his
face
on
album
covers
.
the
pair
recorded
a
few
tunes
together
and
even
appeared
live
at
madison
square
garden
for
a
short
but
legendary
set
in
1975
.
when
lennon
was
senselessly
gunned
down
in
1980
bernie
taupin
set
these
words
to
paper
and
elton
used
them
to
create
this
biting
yearning
ballad
of
loss
.
itâs
all
in
those
opening
words
âwhat
happened
here
as
the
new
york
sunset
disappearsâ
the
world
is
still
asking
itself
that
question
.
hear
'empty
garden
hey
hey
johnny'

'i
'm
still
standing'
from
'too
low
for
zero
'
1983
although
itâs
not
quite
fair
the
eighties
seem
to
be
regarded
as
a
âlost
decadeâ
for
elton
john
at
least
when
it
comes
to
critical
appreciation
.
outside
of
his
1989
'sleeping
with
the
past
'
album
the
first
produced
after
his
recovery
from
drug
addiction
and
1983âs
'too
low
for
zero
'
the
decade
yielded
plenty
of
hits
for
elton
but
few
of
them
memorable
.
the
less
said
about
his
campy
duet
with
george
michael
'wrap
her
up
'
the
better
.
'too
low
'
yielded
our
no
.
9
elton
john
song
selection
and
this
propulsive
rocker
a
staple
of
eltonâs
live
shows
and
another
iconic
song
that
has
come
to
define
the
singerâs
public
persona
.
weaving
effortlessly
between
genres
'iâm
still
standing
'
is
somehow
both
a
full-out
rocker
and
completely
danceable
the
wailing
electric
guitar
and
searing
synth
meshing
with
a
bouncing
bass
line
thatâs
almost
disco-esque
.
hear
'i
'm
still
standing'

'saturday
night
's
alright
for
fighting'
from
'goodbye
yellow
brick
road
'
1973
and
yet
as
great
as
'iâm
still
standing
'
is
and
for
all
the
great
rock
tunes
elton
john
has
contributed
to
classic
rock
playlists
over
the
decades
itâs
'saturday
nightâs
alright
for
fighting
'
that
looms
large
above
them
all
.
itâs
driven
entirely
by
davey
johnstoneâs
legendary
guitar
riff
and
a
snot-nosed
lyric
by
bernie
taupin
that
captures
a
snapshot
of
a
certain
type
of
british
thug
at
a
certain
moment
in
that
nationâs
cultural
history
.
thereâs
no
mercy
or
grace
in
eltonâs
vocal
this
is
all
primal
rock
wail
and
he
absolutely
murders
it
earning
a
spot
on
the
all-time
great
rock
vocalists
list
with
just
this
performance
.
hear
'saturday
night
's
alright
for
fighting'

'tiny
dancer'
from
'madman
across
the
water
'
1971
it
may
have
been
immortalized
by
writerdirector
cameron
crowe
in
'almost
famous
'
but
for
elton
john
fans
'tiny
dancer
'
has
always
been
an
undisputed
classic
.
it
starts
with
that
simple
beautiful
opening
piano
riff
like
the
tinkling
tune
of
a
music
box
and
builds
effortlessly
into
a
full
warm
sound
--
a
chorus
of
voices
a
relaxed
acoustic
guitar
eltonâs
piano
weaving
its
way
around
every
note
.
bernie
taupin
wrote
the
lyrics
for
his
girlfriend
at
the
time
and
surely
her
face
is
lost
to
the
mists
of
history
itâs
the
unforgettable
images
in
his
words
her
dancing
in
the
sand
and
those
jesus
freaks
âhanding
tickets
out
for
godâ
that
will
endure
.
hear
'tiny
dancer'

'rocket
man'
from
'honky
chateau
'
1972
harry
nilsson
did
it
with
'spaceman
'
david
bowie
did
it
with
'space
oddity
'
and
elton
john
did
it
with
'rocket
man
'
--
all
songs
about
the
new-at-the-time
phenomenon
of
men
actually
climbing
aboard
giant
machines
and
soaring
upward
beyond
the
veil
.
but
while
the
other
songs
zero
in
on
the
strangeness
of
space
travel
only
elton
john
and
bernie
taupin
manage
to
capture
the
underlying
sadness
of
drifting
alone
above
earth
so
far
from
family
and
friends
looking
back
at
a
massive
turqouise
orb
that
just
grows
smaller
as
you
float
away
.
itâs
that
emotional
undercurrent
that
human
element
that
elton
and
bernie
so
often
discover
and
that
makes
their
greatest
songs
so
great
.
