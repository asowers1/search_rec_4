recently
i
saw
albert
brooks
on
late
night
with
david
letterman
talking
about
finding
nemo
.
brooks
who
stars
as
the
voice
of
marlon
the
daddy
fish
had
taken
his
son
who
i
believe
was
about
five
years
old
the
equivalent
human
age
of
nemo
to
the
premiere
.
after
about
five
minutes
brooks
said
his
son
leaned
over
to
him
and
quietly
said
the
way
a
grownup
might
``
i
can
not
watch
this
movie
''
and
walked
out
.
late
in
the
movie
the
son
returned
having
obviously
been
crying
.
leaning
over
brooks
assured
his
son
``
you
are
not
nemo
.
``
such
is
the
power
of
this
fish
story
about
father
and
son
clownfish
who
become
separated
and
must
struggle
to
find
their
way
back
to
each
other
.
marlon
is
a
loving
but
neurotic
and
overprotective
father
nemo
is
a
frustrated
young
fish
who
wants
to
be
independent
and
see
the
world
and
resents
his
father
for
preventing
him
from
doing
so
.
we
see
an
ocean
read
the
world
that
is
a
terrible
heartless
and
yet
joyous
place
that
we
frail
fish
must
confront
as
best
we
can
because
there
's
no
alternative.the
animation
was
done
by
the
wonderful
folks
from
pixar
who
are
the
closest
thing
to
the
reincarnation
of
walt
disney
.
there
is
simply
no
comparison
between
the
animation
of
the
typical
visually
flat
politically
correct
contemporary
animated
movie
many
of
which
are
produced
by
walt
disney
pictures
and
nemo
.
in
nemo
the
ocean
floor
looks
like
the
ocean

and
the
characters
are
all

characters
.
they
are
all
physically
distinctive
wonderfully
written
and
performed
by
gifted
actors
who
-
if
you
'll
pardon
the
cliché
-
will
alternately
make
you
laugh

cry

's
getting
in
a
habit
of
constantly
outdoing
themselves
by
gary
jaffe
on
june
7
2003
finding
nemo
is
the
fifth
installment
for
pixar
studios
the
most
reliable
studio
in
hollywood
today
and
it
is
my
personal
favorite
.
the
first
obviously
outstanding
aspect
of
the
movie
is
the
animation
.
from
the
breathtaking
wonder
of
the
great
barrier
reef
to
the
cold
sterile
fish
tank
the
animation
is
top
notch
and
truly
state
of
the
art
.
the
water
which
has
always
been
the
bane
of
animation
is
picture
perfect
and
the
animators
have
captured
the
rolling
but
constant
ocean
and
the
light
refractions
perfectly
.
but
animation
itself
does
n't
make
a
film
.
finding
nemo
's
strongest
aspect
is
it
's
warm
witty
heartfelt
and
funny
story
of
a
father
's
quest
to
reclaim
his
son
.
the
kids
will
love
the
vibrant
characters
and
funny
situations
and
so
will
the
parents
.
however
the
parents
will
be
able
to
enjoy
the
film
on
a
level
far
more
than
the
kids
will
.
the
story
is
about
losing
a
child
and
the
desperate
quest
to
be
reunited
which
will
hit
the
parent
right
in
the
gut
.
this
is
the
story
's
dark
side
which
has
thankfully
not
been
sugar
coated
by
the
creators
.
overall
lets
just
say
halleluja
pixar
you
've
done
it
again

coolest
movie
i
have
ever
seen
.
by
michelle
on
may
30
2003
you
must
see
this
movie.there
.
now
that
i
've
said
that
i
should
tell
you
that
this
is
not
solely
a
childrens
'
movie
but
will
be
enjoyed
as
much
if
not
more
by
adults
.
the
cleverness
of
pixar
will
never
cease
to
amaze
me
.
only
they
could
take
a
concept
like
a
full-length
movie
about
fish
and
make
it
totally
believable
.
this
film
succeeds
n
being
very
very
funny
.
heck
i
'm
16
and
saw
it
in
the
theater
with
only
my
mother
.
the
two
of
us
were
laughing
hysterically
throughout
the
entire
thingthere
's
alot
of
sadness
and
emotion
in
this
movie
and
some
absolutely
terrific
voice
acting
--
the
voice
cast
is
top-notch
.
there
are
some
touching
moments
and
subtle
messages
to
be
heard
by
all
not
just
kids
.
i
look
forward
with
anticipation
to
the
dvd
release
of
this
wonderful
movie
.
the
suspense
never
lets
up
encounters
with
jellyfish
a
whale
and
a
deep-sea
lanturn
fish
make
every
moment
exciting.as
we
know
every
disneypixar
film
is
associated
with
its
own
special
``
short
.
''
well
this
one
is
the
best
yet
and
the
short
film
sets
you
up
for
the
great
feelings
you
'll
have
while
seeing
``
finding
nemo
.
''
i
wo
n't
give
away
the
storyline
but
it
involves
a
cute
snowman
a
water
globe
and
some
tropical
souvenirs
that
completely
ready
one
for
the
overwhelming
tropical-ness
of
the
feature
film.one
thing
i
ca
n't
get
over
is
how
true-to-life
these
characters
are
.
the
attention
to
finding
a
unique
species
for
each
fish
is
incredible
and
adds
a
whole
new
educational
dimension
to
the
movie
.
there
are
some
memorable
characters
in
``
finding
nemo
.
''
first
and
foremost
is
marlin
the
lovable
clownfish
who
is
an
overprotective
father
to
his
adventurous
son
nemo
.
then
there
's
dory
the
regal
blue
tang
with
the
memory
problem.read

aside
from
the
spectacular
animation
the
laughs
and
the
endearing
characters
-
this
film
has
great
educational
value
.
for
whatever
reason
i
grew
up
with
an
...
uneasiness
...
around
people
with
handicaps
.
by
the
end
of
the
film
i
was
completely
oblivious
to
the
fact
two
of
the
main
characters
were
physically
or
mentally
challenged
.
dora
in
fact
was
one
of
the
most
charming
characters
i
've
seen
in
film
recently
-
animated
or
not.i
also
as
a
divorced
father
greatly
appreciated
a
single
father
being
portrayed
as
loving
and
capable
.
too
much
of
media
shows
men
if
not
actually
villains
as
bumbling
or
careless
-
if
they
're
present
at
all.bravo
the
film
is
so
entertaining
you
hardly
notice
positive
lessons
are
being
reinforced
