a

roger

william
of
occam
william
uses
inductive
reasoning
.
he
starts
with
the
observation
of
small
matters
and
works
his
way
from
the
specific
to
the
general
.
moreover
as
a
nominalist
he
distrusts
universal
statements
about
reality
.
says
william
of
us
god
demands
that
we
apply
our
reason
to
many
obscure
things
about
which
scripture
has
left
us
free
to
decide
.
and
when
someone
suggest
you
believe
in
a
proposition
you
must
first
examine
it
to
see
whether
it
is
acceptable
because
our

was

by
god

the
age
of

kicks
within
the
womb
of
the
age
of

.
as
william
interviews
witnesses
and
suspects
we
meet
the
illuminators
the
scribes
the
librarians
the
herbalist
the
cellarer
and
the
abbot
to
work
toward
a
solution
from
small
details
.
sometimes
the
reader
suspects
that
william
was
not
really
interested
in
the
truth
but
rather
just
amused
himself
by
imagining
how
many
possibilities
were
possible

to
jorge
luis
borges
blind
lover
of

william
of
baskerville
and
attempts
to
thwart
him
.
jorge
uses
deductive
reasoning
to
work
his
way
downward
from
general
principles
and
platonic
truth
to
the
specific
.
whereas
william
is
a
humanist
and
liberal
theologian
jorge
adheres
to
a
strict
interpretation
of
the
bible
.
censorious
jorge
rages
at
laughterâmortify

63seen
in
a
more
charitable
light
the
battle
between
jorge
and
william
is
the
ancient
battle
between
faith
and
reason
between
deductive
and
inductive
reasoning
between
universalism
and
nominalism
.
in
the
middle
of
these
competing
worldviews
stands
the
narrator
adso
of
melk
williamâs
young
assistant
who
tries
to
wrap
his
modest
intellect
around
these
warring
sides
.
adso
plays
watson
to
holmes
and
tells
the
story
of
this
mystery
and
of
his
coming
of
age
from
the
perspective
of
old
age.was
adso
able
to
find
a
compromise
between
diametrically
opposed
attitudes
toward
knowledge
what
does
a
mature
adso
think
of
william
says
adso
âwhen
i
doubt
that
the
world
has
an
order
i
am
consoled
to
discover
if
not
an
order
at
least
a
series
of
connections
in
small
areas
of
the
worldâs
affairs.â394conclusioncareful
readers
should
note
the
exact
method
by
which
this
crime
was
solved
inductive
deductive
faith
reason
nominalism
universalism
some
other
force
the
crime
may
be
solved
but
the
real
mystery
survives
to
this
day
.
i
have
read
this
rich
banquet
of
a
novel
three
times
and
like
poor
adso
your
humble
reviewer
is
just
a
confused
and
conflicted
doubter
caught
between
absurdity
and
the
relentless
search
for
truth
.
perhaps
god
exists
perhaps
god
is
laughing

one
of

of
how
a
novelist
was
first
drawn
to
his
profession
scholar
umberto
eco
was
actually
an
italian
history
professor
and
medieval
expert
for
years
before
ever
turning
to
creative
writing
according
to
legend
it
was
his
thrilling
and
exacting
retelling
of
actual
dark
age
stories
that
inspired
his
friends
to
keep
urging
him
to
write
a
novel
based
in
those
times
which
he
finally
did
in
the
late
1970s
.
as
such
then
the
name
of
the
rose
is
a
bizarre
amalgam
that
you
scarcely
ever
find
in
contemporary
literature
--
a
genre
actioner
murder
mystery
with
a
lot
of
melodramatic
elements
at
its
core
but
at
the
same
time
a
detailed
historical
look
at
actual
1300s
europe
with
a
big
part
of
the
reason
to
read
this
book
being
so
that
one
can
be
exposed
to
the
meticulous
detail
of
eco
's
prose
on
the
subject
from
the
period
's
clothing
and
architecture
to
its
religious
structures
and
philosophies
.
but
on
top
of
this
turns
out
that
eco
is
a
postmodernist
and
accomplished
semiotics
expert
as
well
turning
the
book
not
just
into
a
potboiler
mystery
and
historical
novel
but
indeed
an
entire
thesis
on
the
nature
of
language
itself
on
the
meaning
behind
symbols
and
on
why
human
behavior
repeats
itself
so
often
no
matter
which
age
you
study
and
no
matter
what
the
rationale
behind
such
behavior
during
any
given
age.plotwise
it
's
the
story
of
a
franciscan
monk
named
william
of
baskerville
which
is
just
the
start
of
the
sly
references
to
sherlock
holmes
eco
deliberately
inserts
turns
out
that
william
is
also
british
a
champion
of
logic
and
deductive
reasoning
and
even
has
a
clueless
teenage
assistant
named
adso
who
stands
in
symbolically
for
the
equally
clueless
audience
.
william
is
in
italy
helping
a
fellow
monk
investigate
a
mysterious
death
in
the
fortified
abbey
where
the
man
leads
turns
out
in
fact
that
this
is
one
of
the
largest
and
most
renowned
of
all
the
christian
dark-age
monastery
libraries
attracting
an
international
team
of
egghead
monks
and
a
scholarly
atmosphere
more
akin
to
modern
universities
.
both
the
novel
and
the
investigation
take
place
over
seven
days
at
this
fortressabbey
where
william
and
adso
spend
their
time
gathering
clues
pontificating
on
all
kinds
of
subjects
that
intellectuals
in
the
1300s
pontificated
on
and
examining
in
detail
such
historical
details
as
the
church
's
then-ongoing
debate
over
whether
it
's
better
to
be
rich
or
poor
as
well
as
why
the
benedictine
monks
and
the
franciscan
ones
hated
each
other
so
intensely
back
then
in
the
first
place
.
this
being
a
murder
mystery
of
course
the
actual
plot
is
something
best
left
for
the
reader
to
discover
on
their
own
although
i
'll
warn
you
that
the
actual
``
whodunit
''
part
is
n't
very
suspenseful
as
mentioned
above
the
real
point
of
this
being
a
murder
mystery
is
for
eco
to
show
just
how
similarly
humans
behaved
back
then
as
we
do
now
even
as
the
times
themselves
inspire
completely
different
motivations
and
excuses
.
so
in
other
words
a
lot
less
``
i
love
my
baby
's
mamma
''
in
the
1300s
a
lot
more
``
the
devil
made
me
do
it
.
``
the
argument
for
it
being
a
classicfans
of
this
novel
and
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
them
it
's
hard
to
dislike
this
book
frankly
argue
that
this
book
deserves
the
``
classic
''
label
more
quickly
than
a
lot
of
other
contemporary
novels
do
after
all
the
book
's
only
27
years
old
at
this
point
precisely
because
it
deals
with
issues
from
an
age
of
classics
so
in
other
words
because
it
's
set
in
medieval
times
is
written
in
dark
age
vernacular
and
includes
historical
details
worthily
accurate
of
the
respected
academe
eco
is
fans
claim
that
of
course
the
name
of
the
rose
will
eventually
be
a
classic
such
a
foregone
conclusion
that
we
might
as
well
declare
it
one
now
.
ah
but
there
's
also
a
much
stronger
argument
for
this
being
considered
a
classic
right
now
as
mentioned
many
of
those
who
study
the
esoteric
academic
field
of
semiotics
claim
that
the
novel
is
a
perfect
example
of
what
they
do
explained
in
layman
's
terms
so
that
non-academes
can
finally
get
it
.
as
such
then
these
people
claim
that
the
name
of
the
rose
is
not
just
an
exciting
davinci-code-style
historical
thriller
but
also
a
densely
layered
examination
of
stories
about
stories
about
stories
of
symbols
about
symbols
about
symbols
of
the
meaning
behind
meaning
behind
meaning
.
yeah
see
what
they
mean
when
they
say
that
semiotics
is
a
hard
thing
to
explain
to
the
general
publicthe
argument
againstthe
main
argument
against
this
being
a
classic
seems
to
be
one
brought
up
a
lot
with
well-written
yet
contemporary
books
``
contemporary
''
in
this
case
being
any
less
than
half
a
century
old
--
that
the
book
is
simply
too
new
to
be
able
to
reasonably
judge
whether
it
should
rightly
be
called
a
timeless
classic
one
of
those
fabled
``
books
you
should
read
before
you
die
.
''
for
just
one
example
when
the
name
of
the
rose
first
came
out
in
1980
it
was
the
first
time
anyone
had
ever
tried
setting
a
rational
holmesian-style
mystery
story
within
a
medieval
monastery
in
the
years
since
we
've
had
all
kinds
of
projects
on
the
subject
including
a
popular
weekly
bbcmasterpiece
series
.
it
's
a
great
book
even
its
critics
are
quick
to
point
out
even
if
somewhat
on
the
dry
side
at
points
ugh
all
those
debates
about
papal
decrees
but
who
's
to
say
if
anyone
's
going
to
even
remember
this
novel
a
hundred
years
from
now
or
the
notoriously
spotty
career
eco
has
since
had
as
a
novelist
.
do
n't
forget
eco
is
mostly
a
scholar
and
historian
although
considered
a
rockstar
in
the
academic
world
his
reputation
as
a
writer
of
fiction
is
much
more
contentious.my
verdictso
let
's
make
it
clear
right
off
the
bat
--
that
from
a
pure
entertainment
standpoint
the
name
of
the
rose
is
one
of
the
most
delightful
novels
i
've
read
in
years
years
.
it
's
funny
it
's
smart
it
's
insightful
it
's
thrilling
it
's
nerdy
cheese
and
rice
it
's
everything
a
lover
of
books
could
possibly
ever
want
from
a
well-done
one
.
but
is
it
a
classic
well
unfortunately
i
think
i
'm
going
to
have
to
agree
with
the
critics
on
this
one
that
although
it
could
very
well
become
a
classic
one
day
one
of
those
catcher
in
the
rye
style
``
one-hit
wonders
''
that
populate
so
many
lists
i
think
it
's
simply
too
early
to
make
such
a
call
either
in
a
positive
or
negative
way
especially
considering
eco
's
otherwise
spotty
career
as
a
novelist
.
that
's
part
of
the
point
of
``
classics
''
lists
existing
after
all
and
why
those
who
care
about
such
lists
take
them
so
seriously
because
ultimately
such
a
designation
should
reflect
not
only
how
good
a
book
itself
is
but
how
well
it
's
stood
the
test
of
time
of
how
relevant
it
's
continued
to
be
to
generation
after
generation
of
how
timeless
the
author
's
style
and
word-choice
.
one
always
has
to
be
careful
when
adding
newish
books
to
such
lists
especially
novels
less
than
30
years
old
because
we
have
no
idea
at
this
point
how
such
books
are
going
to
stand
the
test
of
time
load
up
your
classics
list
with
such
titles
and
your
list
suddenly
becomes
worthless
fluff
as
relevant
and
important
as
a
whole
evening
of
handing
out
freakin
'
quill
awards
.
it
's
for
this
reason
that
i
'm
excluding
the
name
of
the
rose
from
my
own
personal
canon
although
still
highly
encourage
all
of
you
to
actually
read
it
just
from
the
standpoint
of
pure
enjoyment.is
it
a
classic

hell
there
's
even
a
bit
of
love
and
sex
thrown
in
and
of
multiple
sexual
orientations
he
essentially
takes
sherlock
holmes
and
watson
and
recasts
them
as
monks
in
a
1300
's
abbey
where
murder
and
theological
debates
appear
around
every
corner
.
the
two
main
plots
the
murder
mystery
and
the
religious
debates
weave
together
effortlessly
each
feeding
off
each
other
as
the
tensions
rise
and
the
plot
thickens.this
is
no
simple
plot-driven
thriller
however
.
eco
brings
a
tome
of
medieval
and
christian
history
to
the
table
working
it
as
a
period
piece
and
educates
the
reader
as
well
as
entertains
.
this
has
drawn
a
lot
of
comparisons
to
works
such
as
dan
brown
's
da
vince
code
yet
eco
surpasses
brown
in
almost
every
category
.
this
book
truly
deserve
to
be
considered
``
literature
''
as
there
is
much
more
to
it
than
a
history
and
research
tossed
into
a
plot
.
eco
can
spit
prose
with
the
best
of
them
and
he
will
keep
your
dictionary
close
at
hand
.
his
character
's
speech
is
all
believable
and
what
fascinated
me
the
most
was
how
expertly
he
wrote
the
theological
arguments
between
the
abbey
occupants
.
through
these
characters
many
which
were
real
people
he
presents
believable
and
often
fiery
multifaceted
discussions
on
a
range
of
topics
such
as
heretics
vows
of
poverty
and
gospel
interpretations
.
eco
has
a
vast
knowledge
of
medieval
studies
and
it
shows
.
he
is
also
a
professor
of
semiotics
which
play
a
critical
role
in
this
novel
.
william
's
method
of
deduction
hinges
on
his
ability
to
``
read
the
signs
''
in
the
world
around
him
.
he
carefully
crafts
syllogisms
which
brought
me
back
to
my
logic
and
reasoning
courses
at
msu
to
produce
his
theories
.
eco
puts
his
best
foot
forward
and
gives
the
reader
a
good
introduction
to
his
own
fields
of
study
with
rose
.
however
he
also
throws
in
the
loophole
that
the
world
may
not
be
comprised
of
any
inherent
meaning
and
that
it
is
senseless
to
try
to
apply
meaning
to
randomness
.
this
could
present
quiet
a
dilemma
for
a
monk
who
's
life
draws
meaning
from
the
gospels.perhaps
the
most
exciting
aspect
of
this
novel
was
that
it
was
a
book
about
books
.
the
whole
novel
spins
around
several
texts
such
as
aristotle
and
revelations
but
is
made
up
of
other
books
.
he
even
draws
the
readers
attention
to
this
as
william
explains
to
adso
how
the
contents
of
one
book
can
be
discerned
by
reading
other
books
.
he
strings
together
hefty
allusions
to
other
medieval
texts
and
also
to
one
of
eco
's
and
one
of
my
own
personal
favorite
authors
jorge
luis
borges
.
this
novel
is
saturated
with
allusions
to
borges
works
there
is
even
a
blind
librarian
much
like
the
real
borges
named
jorge
of
burgos
.
i
would
highly
recommend
picking
up
a
copy
of
his
collected
fictions
simply
because
it
is
a
phenomenal
read
and
to
read
selected
stories
such
as
the
library
of
babel
simultaneously
with
the
name
of
the
rose
as
eco
drew
much
of
his
inspiration
for
this
book
from
borges
story
.
the
scenes
in
the
labyrinthine
library
of
the
abbey
are
gold
i
wanted
to
get
lost
with
william
and
adso
as
they
flipped
through
great
works
together
while
trying
to
make
sense
of
their
obfuscating
surroundings
.
eco
's
use
of
metafiction
greatly
adds
to
this
novel
as
an
acute
reading
will
show
eco
is
often
talking
more
about
the
book
itself
than
the
actual
plot
with
his
two
leads
.
he
also
leaves
in
plenty
of
untranslated
latin
while
having
william
conclude
that
true
scholars
must
first
master
languages
and
to
key
in
on
the
idea
that
this
book
was
a
text
found
and
translated
by
the
character
of
eco
.
he
leaves
some
detective
work
for
the
reader
and
i
thank
him
for
that.you
really
need
to
read
this
book
.
there
are
scant
few
people
who
would
not
find
something
of
interest
within
it
's
pages
.
it
is
a
deep
dense
ocean
of
a
novel
and
not
a
little
plot-driven
pool
to
be
waded
through
just
for
enjoyment
but
with
just
a
little
effort
it
will
provide
a
fountain
of
enjoyment
.
that
was
a
weird
out
of
place
and
senseless
string
of
water
metaphors
but
you
get
the
idea

of
the
novel
is
in
its
if
i
had
to
spend
a
year
on
a
desert
island
and
was
only
allowed
to
take
one
book
this
would
be
it
.
at
the
time
of
its
publication
one
reviewer
described
the
name
of
the
rose
'
as
``
a
book
about
everything
''
.
at
first
glance
it
may
seem
to
be
a
book
largely
about
obscure
fourteenth
century
religious
controversies
heresies
and
sects
with
a
murder
mystery
mixed
in
.
but
this
is
a
book
that
rewards
repeat
readings
i
've
just
finished
it
for
the
seventh
time
and
the
heart
of
the
novel
is
in
its
exposition
of
semiotics
-
the
world
as
a
blizzard
of
signs
and
life
and
thought
as
their
constant
interpretation
.
just
as
brother
william
of
baskerville
guides
the
naãve
adso
through
the
world
of
the
monastery
and
the
wider
world
of
knowledge
and
reason
so
eco
guides
the
reader
through
a
story
where
few
things
are
what
they
seem
and
everything
can
be
read
several
ways
.
even
the
obscure
fourteenth
century
sects
'
which
many
readers
find
bewildering
dull
or
both
represent
far
more
than
they
seem
at
first
glance
.
the
long
controversy
over
the
poverty
of
christ
and
its
application
in
the
medieval
church
forms
the
focus
for
a
wide-ranging
analysis
of
how
ideals
can
motivate
and
inspire
different
people
in
different
ways
.
in
this
novel
we
find
skeptics
like
william
mystical
non-conformists
like
umbertino
de
casale
terrorists
and
revolutionaries
like
the
dolcinite
heretics
and
rigid
fundamentalists
like
jorge
and
bernard
gui
.
at
the
time
of
its
first
publication
the
parallels
between
the
book
's
religious
politics
and
modern
manifestations
of
the
same
ways
of
thinking
including
cold
war
political
expediency
and
terrorists
like
the
red
brigades
would
have
been
obvious
to
italian
readers
.
these
days
in
the
wake
of
911
and
the
iraq
war
eco
's
analysis
has
not
lost
any
of
its
resonance
.
some
warnings
for
new
readers
-
if
you
think
the
truly
appalling
the
da
vinci
code
'
was
``
masterful
writing
''
you
probably
want
to
save
yourself
time
and
effort
and
read
something
else
.
it
's
not
as
daunting
as
many
make
out
but
``
rose
''
is
far
from
a
light
read
.
eco
also
deliberately
made
the
first
100
pages
a
difficult
read
but
stick
with
it
.
all
those
obscure
politics
and
odd
names
do
make
some
sense
after
a
while
.
secondly
many
reviewers
have
complained
about
the
untranslated
latin
passages
.
despite
what
some
of
them
have
said
these
are
rarely
more
than
a
line
or
two
and
usually
short
lines
at
that
.
medievalists
will
recognise
most
of
them
anyway
they
are
quotes
from
the
vulgate
occam
and
aquinas
and
so
on
and
usually
famous
ones
but
non-specialists
will
usually
get
the
essence
of
them
from
their
contexts
.
in
almost
all
cases
they
are
roughly
translated
or
paraphrased
in
the
dialogue
that
precedes
or
follows
them
anyway
so
they
are
n't
actually
untranslated
'
at
all
-
they
just
look
that
way
.
thirdly
people
who
approach
this
novel
merely
as
a
medieval
whodunit
a
la
the
brother
caedfel
mysteries
are
likely
to
find
rose
'
a
strain
.
while
the
mystery
story
forms
the
basis
of
the
plot
there
is
a
lot
more
to
this
novel
than
plot
.
some
have
said
they
found
the
mystery
clichãd
and
derivative
of
other
mysteries
.
ummm
...
yes
-
eco
is
a
postmodernist
.
it
's
meant
to
be
derivative
.
the
real
joy
of
this
novel
is
its
layers
of
meaning
which
is
why
it
's
one
that
can
be
read
and
re-read
with
new
discoveries
every
time
.
it
's
a
delight
to
read
and
great
exercise
for
the
mind
and
spirit
as
well
as
a
counter
to
those
who
think
the
middle
ages
was
simply
a
period
of
superstition
and
ignorance
.
far
from
being
an
anachronism
or
a
prefigurement
of
more
enlightened
'
times
william
of
baskerville
represents
the
medieval
voices
of
reason
innovation
and
logic
that
are
ignored
by
most
popular
representations
of
this
badly
misunderstood
period
.
a
must
read
-
but
with
your
brain
well
and
truly
in
high
gear
.

historical
context
the
story
occurs
during
the
time
the
papacy
had
moved
from
its
traditional
location
in
italy
to
avignon
.
john
xxii
is
a
pope
brought
to
the
head
of
the
holy
roman
church
by
the
king
of
france
.
john
is
not
the
first
pope
to
leave
the
church
's
italian
home.however
it
is
1327
and
great
dissatisfaction
pervades
europe
that
a
french
king
should
have
political
influence
over
the
church
.
traditionally
following
the
division
of
the
roman
empire
between
west
and
east
the
secular
protection
of
the
church
had
fallen
to
the
emperor
of
the
holy
roman
empire
a
title
held
by
members
of
the
royal
families
of
germany
.
in
that
year
louis
iv
would
declare
himself
the
king
of
italy
and
in
1328
he
would
crown
himself
the
next
emperor
of
the
holy
roman
empire.louis
'
entrance
into
italy
was
inevitable
as
king
phillip
of
france
had
encouraged
an
alliance
with
the
``
french
''
pope
through
his
connection
with
the
king
of
naples
.
louis
'
sympathies
or
perhaps
his
political
acumen
led
him
to
support
the
franciscan
order
committed
to
the
life
of
poverty
.
this
was
in
direct
contradiction
to
the
papal
bulls
issued
by
john
xxii
who
saw
the
franciscan
orders
as
a
disruptive
force
among
the
common
people
.
off
shoots
of
the
fransiscan
's
particularly
the
psuedo-apostles
led
by
fra
dolcino
had
led
to
absolute
chaos
in
italy
.
dolcino
's
common
followers
attacked
the
wealthy
to
bring
about
a
universal
state
of
poverty
.
there
should
be
no
rich
.
there
should
be
no
poor
.
the
ultimate
goal
of
dolcino
was
to
abolish
the
need
of
the
church
and
place
it
under
the
authority
of
the
people
.
under
this
theory
there
was
no
need
for
popes
cardinals
bishops
or
ecclesiastical
offices
of
any
type.william
of
baskerville
's
purpose
in
going
to
the
abbey
of
melko
is
as
an
emissary
of
the
imperial
theologians
to
negotiate
a
meeting
between
legations
appointed
by
the
pope
and
louis
to
resolve
the
conflict
between
the
papacy
the
minorite
or
franciscan
orders
and
louis
.
what
is
at
stake
is
a
reinterpretation
between
church
and
state
.
that
the
underlying
issue
concerns
who
will
wield
true
power
in
europe
is
obvious.however
william
's
true
mission
is
delayed
.
for
upon
his
arrival
he
discovers
that
a
young
illuminator
in
the
abbey
's
scriptorium
has
met
an
untimely
death
.
was
it
murder
or
suicide
the
death
of
a
second
monk
clearly
indicates
that
someone
in
the
closed
society
of
the
abbey
of
melk
is
a
murderer.accompanied
by
his
scribe
adso
william
sets
out
to
investigate
the
deaths
of
the
two
monks
.
the
mystery
only
deepens
as
more
deaths
occur
.
the
circumstances
seem
to
follow
the
sounding
of
the
trumpets
as
revealed
in
the
revelation
of
john.eco
continues
to
complicate
the
facts
of
william
's
case
by
revealing
that
the
abbey
contains
one
of
the
finest
libraries
known
in
the
contemporary
world
.
interestingly
no
one
but
the
librarian
his
assistant
or
someone
with
the
permission
of
the
abbot
himself
can
gain
entry
to
the
library
which
is
protected
by
a
labyrinth
seemingly
incapable
of
being
navigated.william
of
baskerville
is
the
equivalent
of
a
medieval
sherlock
holmes
.
adso
whose
french
name
happens
to
be
adson
conveniently
rhyming
with
watson
.
william
is
a
man
committed
to
logic
.
he
is
a
student
of
roger
bacon
.
he
is
a
contemporary
of
william
of
occam
.
it
should
come
as
no
surprise
that
he
is
capable
of
the
art
of
deduction
through
that
logic
nor
that
he
should
be
in
possession
of
a
pair
of
optical
lenses
serving
him
as
eyeglasses
enabling
him
to
read
the
tiny
writing
of
a
murdered
monk
barely
perceptible
to
the
naked
eye
.
the
monk
's
almost
invisible
writing
lead
william
and
adso
to
discover
the
secrets
of
the
labyrinth
and
to
search
for
a
book
that
seems
to
hold
the
motive
for
the
accumulating
bodies
day
by
day.the
abbot
pointedly
tells
william
that
the
matter
of
these
deaths
must
be
resolved
prior
to
the
arrival
of
the
two
legations
.
the
papal
legation
is
headed
by
bernard
of
gui
an
infamous
inquisitor
who
has
burned
many
a
heretic
in
his
long
history
as
a
defender
of
the
faith
.
surely
bernard
will
take
over
the
question
of
the
deaths
at
the
abbey
and
use
them
to
strengthen
the
pope
's
position
that
the
franciscan
's
philosophy
of
the
poverty
of
christ
be
eliminated
by
the
pope.william
and
adso
's
exploration
of
the
labyrinth
to
discover
a
missing
book
the
seeming
motive
for
the
murders
intensify
.
and
they
succeed
in
discovering
their
way
through
the
labyrinth
.
however
they
are
unsuccessful
in
unraveling
an
endless
thread
of
textual
clues
leading
from
one
manuscript
to
the
next
prior
to
the
arrival
of
the
two
opposed
legations.as
feared
the
discovery
of
yet
another
body
the
herbalist
severinus
leads
bernard
gui
to
take
over
the
inquisition
to
root
out
the
evil
present
in
the
abbey
.
bernard
is
ruthless
.
torture
is
an
accepted
practice
to
disclose
the
works
of
the
devil
.
as
expected
bernard
announces
he
intends
to
inform
the
pope
that
the
franciscan
orders
of
poverty
should
be
prohibited.nevertheless
william
and
adso
will
solve
the
mystery
of
the
labyrinth
the
secret
manuscript
it
contains
and
the
identity
of
the
murderer
.
in
keeping
with
my
practice
not
to
reveal
any
spoilers
of
plot
i
will
not
address
the
identity
of
the
murderer
nor
the
motive
for
the
crimes.but
i
will
say
this
.
``
the
name
of
the
rose
''
is
a
labyrinth
complete
within
itself
.
while
a
labyrinth
may
contain
a
solution
and
one
may
escape
its
twists
and
turns
it
is
not
always
possible
to
end
up
with
an
answer
that
leaves
no
ambiguity
.
there
is
more
than
one
labyrinth
present
in
eco
's
wonderful
work
.
one
question
relates
to
the
interpretation
of
knowledge
itself
.
is
knowledge
finite
are
there
universal
truths
or
is
it
a
matter
of
what
appears
to
be
the
truth
only
subject
to
interpretation
by
individualsto
the
librarians
of
the
abbey
melko
knowledge
was
something
to
be
protected
from
disclosure
.
as
i
mentioned
to
one
friend
the
library
took
on
the
connotation
of
eden
's
tree
of
life
from
which
man
and
woman
were
forbidden
to
eat
.
it
was
knowledge
gained
from
eating
the
forbidden
fruit
that
led
to
the
loss
of
innocence
.
considering
that
the
library
contained
many
works
considered
by
the
librarians
to
be
the
work
of
infidels
it
would
be
their
purpose
to
hide
those
works
from
the
innocent
.
yet
the
mere
possession
of
that
knowledge
also
led
to
its
misinterpretation
and
the
accusation
of
heresy.clearly
during
the
heated
debate
between
the
papal
and
imperial
legations
knowledge
did
not
exist
independent
of
the
thinker
's
perception
.
one
postulation
of
a
particular
theological
theorem
was
subject
to
debate
on
the
most
minute
detail
out
of
political
motivation.but
adso
may
well
have
had
the
most
significant
statement
to
make
regarding
books
and
their
contents
.
it
will
be
one
of
my
favorite
passages
''
until
then
i
had
thought
each
book
spoke
of
the
things
human
or
divine
that
lie
outside
books
.
now
i
realized
that
not
infrequently
books
speak
of
books
it
is
as
if
they
spoke
among
themselves
.
in
the
light
of
this
reflection
the
library
seemed
all
the
more
disturbing
to
me
.
it
was
then
the
place
of
long
centuries-old
murmuring
an
imperceptible
dialogue
between
one
parchment
and
another
a
living
thing
a
receptacle
of
powers
not
to
ruled
by
a
human
mind
a
treasure
of
secrets
emanated
by
many
minds
surviving
the
death
of
those
who
had
produced
them
or
had
been
their
conveyors.â
even
william
was
subject
to
hearing
words
so
familiar
he
knew
he
had
read
them
before
but
could
not
remember
the
name
of
the
book
.
âit
seemed
to
me
as
i
read
this
page
that
i
had
read
some
of
these
words
before
and
some
phrases
that
are
almost
the
same
which
i
have
seen
elsewhere
return
to
my
mindâ
books
find
themselves
the
creator
of
other
bookswhen
they
become
so
deeply
planted
in
our
subconscious
.
a
famous
contemporary
example
is
found
in
nabokov
's
``
lolita
.
''
nabokov
's
character
first
appeared
in
a
short
story
``
lolita
''
written
in
1916
by
heinz
von
eschwege
.
the
story
lines
are
quite
similar
.
nabokov
has
been
said
to
have
created
artistic
improprieties
or
been
subject
to
a
phenomenon
known
as
``
cryptomnesia
''
a
hidden
memory
of
a
story
he
had
once
read
.
michael
marr
author
of
``
the
two
lolitas
''
wrote
``
literature
has
always
been
a
huge
crucible
in
which
familiar
themes
are
continually
recast
...
''
perhaps
james
baldwin
said
it
best
.
``
it
was
books
that
taught
me
that
the
things
that
tormented
me
most
were
the
very
things
that
connected
me
with
all
the
people
who
were
alive
or
who
had
ever
been
alive
.
``
as
``
the
name
of
the
rose
''
contains
a
multitude
of
latin
phrases
i
think
it
fitting
to
add
one
more
not
included
in
the
book
itself
.
that
is
``
sub
rosa
.
''
the
concept
first
appears
in
egyptian
culture
.
the
rose
was
the
symbol
of
the
egyptian
god
horus
most
often
represented
by
a
child
holding
his
finger
to
his
mouth
as
if
he
were
saying
``
shhhh
.
''
it
became
symbolic
of
silence
.
it
reappears
in
greek
and
roman
mythology
.
venusaphrodite
gave
a
rose
to
cupid
which
served
as
a
symbol
of
silence
regarding
her
many
indiscretions
in
love
.
by
the
middle
ages
the
rose
had
a
definite
meaning
.
in
those
times
when
a
party
of
individuals
met
in
a
council
hall
a
rose
was
hung
over
the
table
.
whatever
was
discussed
``
under
the
rose
''
was
secret
and
all
parties
meeting
under
the
rose
agreed
that
the
subject
of
their
discussions
was
confidential
.
much
lies
under
the
surface
of
this
novel
.
it
was
deemed
by
the
characters
to
be
secret
.
and
so
i
believe
eco
would
have
us
treat
this
novel
in
modo
sub
rosa
leaving
each
reader
to
discover
its
secrets
in
their
own
manner
.
the

the
more
secrets
remain
to
be
discovered
.

whereas
in

the
name
of
the
rose
is
very
slow

.
i
appreciate
the
attention
to
detail
and
the
minute
and
accurate
descriptions
of
real
historical
events
but
i
feel
that
the
narrators
voice
often
became
mired
in
these
details
to
the
detriment
of
the
plot
.
when
the
narrator
adso
slipped
into
these
trains
of
thought
that
were
only
tangential
to
the
story
i
frequently
forgot
what
was
going
on
by
the
time
he
emerged
.
in
addition
much
of
the
historical
background
read
like
a
text-book
and
not
a
novel
.
there
were
too
many
dates
and
names
to
keep
track
of
and
while
these
elements
may
have
been
central
to
the
story
whowhat
they
were
was
never
fully
explained
.
on
the
positive
side
the
translation
is
done
beautifully
and
i
can
only
imagine
that
the
original
italian
is
even
more
agile
and
lyrical
.
for
those
who
want
to
stick
with
a
500
page
novel
the
name
of
the
rose
can
be
quite
rewarding
.
i
feel
that
i
learned
a
lot
about
life
in
a
medieval
italian
monastery
and
about
the
most
important
philosophical
and
religious
concerns
of
the
time
.
i
just
would
have
preferred
it
if
eco
had
focused
more
on
writing
a
cohesive
engaging
novel
rather
than
a
history
lesson
surrounded
by
the
vague
framework
of
a
plot
.

roman

archenemy
representatives
of
the
pope
john
who
resided
then
in
avignon
.
organizing
the
meeting
was
actually
the
main
duty
of
william.i
have
to
admit
that
my
interest
lies
deeper
in
the
first
plot
.
it
's
just
more
simple
.
the
murders
were
somewhat
arranged
in
certain
fashions
mimicking
the
prophesied
events
during
the
sounding
of
seven
trumpets
in
the
apocalypse
.
plus
the
abbey
itself
with
all
its
rich
legacies
and
precious
relics
holds
many
secrets
and
intrigues
with
the
center
of
attention
was
its
amazing
library
that
no
one
can
enter
except
the
librarian
.
the
library
was
said
to
be
the
most
complete
library
in
europe
contained
not
only
teachings
on
the
scriptures
but
also
those
of
heretics
magicians
alchemists
etc.william
of
baskerville
our
monk-detective
presented
a
unique
character
with
his
use
of
logic
and
modern
tools
.
his
novice
adso
of
melk
well
he
's
your
typical
boyscout
but
suffering
from
a
number
of
delusions
and
inner
battles
the
curse
of
youth
perhaps
.
they
both
embarked
on
a
fascinating
adventure
in
the
abbey
trying
to
solve
the
mystery
of
the
library
and
its
almost
innumerable
labyrinths
deciphering
symbols
facing
bizarre
monks
ranging
from
hostile
mysterious
frightened
excessively
curious
and
most
of
all
they
all
have
motives
for
killing
.
most
of
the
victims
were
connected
to
the
library
.
suffice
to
say
the
murders
is
caused
by
something
in
the
library
which
should
not
be
seen
by
others.the
second
plot
well
could
n't
say
i
really
understand
the
narratives
and
dialogues
since
they
mostly
involved
theological
debates
whether
monks
were
allowed
to
be
poor
.
the
pope
said
the
franciscans
were
heretics
while
the
accused
said
the
pope
was
corrupt
.
my
brain
is
just
not
strong
enough
for
that
kind
of
thing
.
i
love
the
quarreling
part
though
when
the
monks
lost
their
temper
because
it
's
so
damn
funny.despite
some
desperate
efforts
from
my
part
to
skip
some
pages
of
this
book
due
to
my
lack
of
understanding
i
still
say
this
book
has
its
own
grandeur
.
perhaps
because
if
there
's
an
existing
library
as
magnificent
as
the
one
in
the
abbey
i
shall
be
very
interested
to
have
to
a
visit
there
.
seduction
does
not
always
come
from
human
flesh
or
splendid
treasures
but
also
in
knowledge
.
and
sometimes
it
's
even
more
dangerous.will
i
read
other
eco
's
works
yeah
sure
why
not
.
next
would
be
the
foucault
's
pendulum

be
a
diabolically
devised
mystery
set
in
the
early
13th
century
yet
it
is
so
much
more
than
this
.
on
the
surface
it
contains
an
ideology
and
idea
about
exploring
the
reality
of
man
and
the
human
condition
.
deeper
down
the
ideology
subtly
implies
that

is
what

and
further
that
the
world

of
signs
linked
into
other
signs
much
as
all
novels
arguably
link
to
each

.
part
of
the
brilliance
of
this
text
is
how
eco
links
together
the
past
late-medieval
setting
and
views
with
modern
ideas
and
preconceptions
providing
a
fascinating
discussion
as
regards

particularly
catholicism
.
yet
at
the
same
time
there
is
a
quandary
posed
by
the
text
for
the
astute
reader
.
eco
appears
as
both
critic

proponent
of
religion
within
this
novel

in

moment
he
argues
that
an
overt
attachment
to

can
not
help
but
create
a
flawed
worldview

safer
to
assume
that

that
an
over
adherence
to

is

corruption

ecoâs
novel
on
its
surface
tackles
head
on
the
idea
that
corruption
and
desire
exists
within
even
the
most
pure
of
all
men
.
each
of
the
monks
are
described
in
meticulous
detail
as
men
with
slight
blemishes
to
their
character
whether
that
be
the
sexual
sins
of
âsodomyâ
and
âadulteryâ
or
the
other
sins
of
pride
and
selfish
ambition
.
eco
suggests
that
all
men
are
at
their
nature
flawed
regardless
of
how
pure
an
individual
is
.
yet
it
seems
that
some
men
are
more
corrupted
than
others
or
rather
some
men
give
into
their
corruption
using
religion
as
a
powerful
cover
up
.
view

it
is
this
form
of
corruption
that
ultimately
destroys
the
monastery
through
fire
.
hide

and
herbsthe
name
of
the
rose
contains
several
passages
of
fantastic
visions
which
the
narrator
describes
in
detail
.
these
visions
link-up
to
the
mystery
of
the
novel
and
help
link
back
to
the
religious
content
of
the
book
which
itself
refers
often
to
the
book
of
revelations
.
at
the
same
time
these
dream
sequences
create
a
sense
of
the
narrator
being
unreliable
though
throughout
most
of
the
text
he
appears
entirely
reliable
.
this
sense
of
unreliability
is
compounded
by
the
reference
to
various
hallucinogenic
herbs
which
are
utilised
in
the
monastery
or
eatenburned
by
the
monks
.
as
a
final
note
it
is
particularly
interesting
that
like
sherlock
holmes
the
protagonist
appears
to
be
addicted
to
certain
herbs
thus
perpetuating
the
idea
that
all
good
detectives
must
rely
on
performance
enhancing
drugs
.
firethere
is
the
sense
in
this
novel
about
the
dual
nature
of
fire
much
as
eco
seems
to
be
conflicted
in
his
views
on
religion
.
fire
is
a
recurring
motif
in
this
novel
and
is
used
to
represent
emotional
desire
and
the
ability
to
purify
.

in
the

where
the
narrator

hide
spoiler
conclusion
the
name
of
the
rose
is
a
fine
work
a
beautiful
work
and
yet
a
convoluted
and
bizarre
work
of
fiction
.
it
is
perhaps
one
of
the
deeper
works
of
fiction
in
any
genre
willing
to
ask
big
questions
without
resolving
them
and
packaging
such
thoughts
within
a
historical
mystery
.
perhaps
one
of
the
best
links
to
reality
that
this
novel
creates
is
the
reflection
that
reality
is
a
mystery
to
those
within
it
and
yet
when
outside
of
that
reality
one
can
observe
the
mysteryâs
secret

as
a
piece
of
historical
fiction
all
very
proper
inside
its
fake
framing
narrative
but
also
managing
to
be
a
spoof
murder-mystery.the
main
character
is
william
of
baskerville
who
has
a
watson
like
side-kick
.
he
may
not
use
cocaine
but
he
does
eat
'certain
herbs
'
and
some
of
his
description
is
lifted
from
that
of
a
famous
resident
of
baker
street
.
and
wait
a
is
n't
a
monastery
with
it
's
hidden
conflicts
and
desires
awfully
similar
in
some
ways
to
a
country
house
however
in
line
with
eco
's
approach
the
resolution
is
more
sheer
luck
than
sherlock.the
title
suggestively
evokes
the
romance
of
the
rose
although
here
the
beloved
flower
projected
in
the
walled
garden
is
not
an
allegorical
representation
of
woman
but
of
learning
and
the
power
of
knowledge
to
transform
our
outlook
on
the
world
.
the
figure
of
jealously
literally
embodied
in
the
monk
who
protects
this
great
treasure
not
simply
with
a
castle
's
walls
but
inside
a
labyrinth
library
with
a
secret
reading
room.the
form
of
the
labyrinthine
library
is
taken
from
borges
the
library
of
babel
and
so
the
story
proceeds
with
layers
of
references
to
surprise
and
amuse
however
if
you
are
in
danger
of
floundering
among
them
the
trick
is
to
find
out
what
the
hidden
book
at
the
centre
of
the
library
is
all
about
and
to
keep
that
in
mind
for
every
reread.the
relationship
between
truth
myth
and
invention
is
a
theme
that
in
the
name
of
the
rose
shares
with
foucaults
pendulum
and
baudolino
.
here
we
are
introduced
to
the
mysterious
room
and
its
hidden
content
which
we
can
take
as
a
metaphor
for
the
meaning
of
life
or
the
quest
for
meaning
in
life
maybe
but
with
intelligence
guile
and
luck
the
heroes
can
know
the
truth
.
in
foucaults
pendulum
by
contrast
the
hidden
room
is
unreachable
view
spoilerwhich
given
the
ending
of
in
the
name
of
the
rose
is
unsurprising
hide
spoiler
and
its
potential
contents
are
contested
among
many
groups
and
individuals
whose
need
for
meaning
is
so
great
that
they
are
vulnerable
to
anyoneâs
'
and
everyoneâs
'
claims
of
knowing
what
is
inside
that
room
even
if
with
shades
of
baudolino
that
'knowledge
'
is
the
purist
of
inventions
unsullied
by
any
relation
to
reality.the
problem
in
eco
's
universe
is
not
the
hidden
room
or
its
contents
but
in
the
attitude
of
people
towards
it
.
in
foucaults
pendulum
the
diabolicals
take
it
terribly
seriously
with
fatal
consequences
here
its
protector
fears
the
content
so
terribly
that
no
one
can
remain
safe
yet
that
book
seems
to
me
to
embody
eco
's
attitude
to
all
readers
of
these
three
books
view
spoiler
in
other
words
do
n't
take
it
too
seriously
hide
spoiler.god
fun
with
theology
and
medieval
philosophising
and
good
fun
for
all
readers
.

guess
the
holy
hot
pincers
of
chastisement
kept
you
all
nodding
your
heads
and
staying
in
line
more
or
less
.
the
huge
amount
of
splinter
sects
and
``
heretical
''
offshoots
are
mind-boggling
and
they
're
all
convinced
the
others
are
wrong
because
the
popular
front
thinks
christ
only
farted
on
sundays
and
the
people
's
front
insists
it
was
thursday
afternoons
after
the
tea
cucumber
sammiches
or
some
such
crap
.
no
wonder
the
middle
ages
were
a
mess
and
continuing
a
long
tradition
of
dogmatic
asshattery.follow
the
gourd
following
the
sandal
is
just
silly
.
while
all
the
semiotic
stuff
whizzed
right
over
my
head
i
was
still
glued
to
the
pages
and
did
n't
skip
a
word
and
it
did
n't
feel
like
a
chore
.
pats
self
on
back
cool
the
last
part
of
the
book
was
slightly
different
than
the
movie
even
so
the
fact
that
the
mystery
plot
itself
adhered
closely
to
the
book
did
n't
make
it
boring
or
a
feeling
of
arrgh-i've-seen-this-already
.
on
the
contrary
there
was
so
much
new
stuff
with
the
history
and
theology
that
the
whole
thing
was
super-fresh
and
exciting
.
the
humor
.
i
loved
adso
's
narration
and
the
coming-of-age
aspect
of
it
as
well
as
his
older-self-looking-back-on-his-younger-self
perspective
.
he
and
william
had
a
great
rapport
another
thing
that
the
movie
nailed
.
that
abbey
was
one
gay
place.as
is
obvious
i
'd
seen
the
movie
before
reading
the
book
and
i
think
it
made
the
reading
experience
a
bit
easier
so
i
could
focus
on
the
theological
debates
the
history
and
eco
's
narrative
style
.
i
'd
recommend
seeing
the
movie
first
especially
if
you
're
approaching
the
book
as
a
random
read
and
not
as
a
literary
scholar
which
i
ai
n't
as
is
obvious.i
greatly
enjoyed
it
and
am
glad
that
i
finally
sacked
up
and
read
it
after
being
intimidated
by
it
for
so
long.eta
whoops
...
rosemary
rogers
.
i
mentioned
that
in
my
last
update
.
ok
so
this
book
...
.awesome
and
page-turning
i
understand
what
's
going
on
and
being
said
as
i
read
but
just
try
to
tell
someone
else
what
's
going
on
and
what
's
being
said
pffft
.
forget
it
.
read
it
for
yourself
.
that
's
been
the
exact
same
experience
i
've
had
with
every
rosemary
rogers
book
i
've
ever
read.if
these
two
ever
collaborated
on
a
book
together
my
head
would

his
innocent
companion
the
novice
adso
who
tells
us
this
tale
of
his
youth
from

perspective

age
.
in
this
tour-de-force
by
eco
we
come
across
a
motley
crew
of
strange
characters
from
the
pitable
and
beastly
salvatore

the
urbane
and
pompous

figure
painted

extreme
colours

woven
into
the
mystery
plot
and
panoply
of
characters
is
a
dazzling
mix
of
medieval
politics
and
philosophy
as
the
abbey
is
playing
host
to
a
meeting
between
rival
theological
factions
the
franciscans
who
hope
to
validate
their
beliefes
and
way
of
life
in
the
midst
of
controversy
and
their
enemies
who
hope
to
squash
this
rival
group
in
its
infancy.to
me
reading
eco
has
been
an
experience
of
diminishing
returns
as
each
novel
he
has
written
seems
to
have
fallen
further
and
further
from
the
heights
achieved
by
this
novel
until
i
could
not
even
finish
_baudolino_
due
to
its
unreadability
.
that
being
said
_the
name
of
the
rose_
is
a
classic
and
i
highly
encourage
any
and
all
to
enter
into
its
fascinating
world

using

case

be
careful
not
to
hurl
as
you
read
this
.
the
old
monk
william
and
the
narrator
apprentice
adso
are
hiding
out
in
the
stables.to
his
right
the
the
third
animal
in
line
raised
his
head
sensing
our
presence
and
whinnied
.
i
smiled
.
``
tertius
equi
''
i
said
.
``
what
''
william
asked
.
``
nothing
.
i
was
remembering
poor
salvatore
.
he
wanted
to
perform
god
knows
what
magic
with
that
horse
and
with
his
fractured
latin
he
called
him
'tertius
equi
.
'
which
would
be
the
u
.
''
``
the
u
''
asked
william
who
had
heard
my
prattle
without
paying
much
attention
to
it
.
``
yes
because
'tertiu
equi
'
does
not
mean
the
third
horse
but
the
third
of
the
horse
and
the
third
letter
of
the
word
'equus
'
is
u
.
but
this
is
all
nonsense
...
''
william
looked
at
me
and
in
the
darkness
i
seemed
to
see
his
face
transformed
.
``
god
bless
you
adso
''
he
said
to
me
.
``
why
of
course
suppositio
materialis
the
discourse
is
presumed
de
dicto
and
not
de
re
...
.what
a
fool
i
am
''
he
gave
himself
such
a
great
blow
on
the
forehead
that
i
heard
a
clap
and
i
believe
he
hurt
himself
.
``
my
boy
this
is
the
second
time
today
that
wisdom
has
spoken
through
your
mouth
first
in
dream
and
now
in
waking
run
run
to
your
cell
and
fetch
the
lamp
or
rather
both
lamps
we
hid
.
let
no
one
see
you
and
join
me
in
the
church
at
once
ask
no
questions.
''
...
i
ran
into
the
church
.
william
was
under
the
tripod
and
was
rereading
the
parchment
with
venantius
's
notes
.
``
adso
''
he
said
to
me
``
'primum
et
septimum
de
equator
'
does
not
mean
the
first
and
seventh
of
four
but
of
the
four
the
word
'four
'
''
for
a
moment
i
still
did
not
understand
but
then
i
was
enlightened
``
super
thronos
viginti
quatuor
the
writing
the
verse
the
words
are
carved
over
the
mirror
''
``
come
''
william
said
``
perhaps
we
are
still
in
time
to
save
a
life

not

also

so
i
had

william

it
is
a
mix
of
whodunnit
like
the
recent
novel
i
read
of
agatha
christie
the
murder
of
roger
ackroyd
and
historical
novel
set
in
medieval
period
like
ken
follett
's
pillars
of
the
earth
.
naturally
i
started
leafing
the
pages
with
gusto
because
i
liked
both
novels.however
there
are
just
too
many
details
and
latin
phrases
in
the
book
that
can
annoy
readers
who
are
not
fully
familiar
with
that
period
of
european
history
and
that
dying
language
.
also
after
the
pattern
seemingly
being
followed
by
the
``
killer
''
was
later
revealed
to
be
a
series
of
coincidences
only
the
magic
of
being
a
mystery
novel
just
vanished
.
it
is
as
if
the
climax
was
built
for
nothing
.
with
me
spending
400
pages
of
understanding
the
details
of
the
pattern
was
a
bit
disappointing.the
narrative
is
beautiful
though
.
considering
that
this
was
just
translated
from
the
original
language
it
was
written
italian
is
an
achievement
for
the
translator
.
the
reason
is
that
the
english
prose
retained
its
cadence
and
appropriateness
to
its
ancient
italian
setting
.
it
has
that
feeling
of
being
a
classic
despite
the
novel
having
been
written
by
umberto
eco
only
in
the
early
80's.lately
i
have
been
reading
novels
written
several
decades
ago
or
with
settings
way
back
many
centuries
ago
and
sometimes
this
makes
me
feel
ancient
too
.
i
should
read
something
very
contemporary
next
to
this
.
otherwise
my
backpain
might
decide
to
stay
as
my
brain
thinks
that
i
am
already
a
senior
citizen
and
having
body
aches
is
just
but
natural
.

up
his
lists
for
too
long
or
when
one
of
the
characters
was
especially
verbose
on
religious
concerns
.
at
least
i
have
some
familiarity
with
the
bible
and
its
related
texts
or
i
would
have
been
completely
lost
.
it
was
odd
though
.
it
almost
seemed
that
the
author
planned
it
that
way
as
detective
monk
william
of
baskerville
would
often
give
insights
into
how
ridiculous
the
whole
concept
of
religion
is
.
this
ridiculousness
was
very
apparent
in
the
debates
over
laughter
heresy
and
the
differences
between
the
countless
denominations
.
so
perhaps
it
was
intended
.
made
for
some
very
boring
passages
i
will
admit
.
but
the
brilliant
flashes
of
common
sense
and
amazing
trains
of
thought
were
enough
to
tide
me
over
.
i
only
wish
more
of
the
book
was
like
that.but
i
must
say
blatant
inspiration
is
blatant
.
it
's
been
a
while
since
i
've
read
the
sherlock
holmes
books
so
i
'll
be
modeling
my
observations
after
my
more
recent
watching
of
the
bbc
series
unorthodox
i
know
but
it
illustrates
my
point
.
the
overwhelming
powers
of
observation
and
subsequent
deduction
the
use
of
drugs
to
ameliorate
thinking
the
meditative
states
that
heightened
these
neurological
processes
to
a
sharp
focal
point
and
especially
the
final
relationship
between
william
and
the
revealed
villain
.
that
heady
mix
of
moral
antagonism
and
intellectual
respect
was
very
very
familiar
.
it
's
a
shame
that
it
did
n't
last
the
intelligent
state
of
mind
at
any
rate
.
william
's
novice
had
flashes
of
insight
only
when
in
the
presence
of
his
mentor
and
the
manuscript
he
writes
shows
how
far
back
he
has
slipped
into
the
comfort
of
religious
ignorance
.
he
saw
the
sense
of
writing
down
what
happened
at
any
rate
.
and
his
discomfort
with
his
state
of
mind
in
view
of
his
memories
shows
that
he
is
n't
completely
resigned
to
the
sheep
state
of
blind
faith
.
but
that
does
n't
really
matter
.
what
matters
is
that
i
have
a
couple
more
books
by
this
author
to
get
through
and
the
reading
should
be
interesting
if
they
are
as
filled
with
convoluted
and
contrasting
passages
as
this
one
.

but
chose
to
leave
that
``
august
''
body
lacking
their
rabid
style
and
beliefs
.
on
arriving
at
the
abbey
he
finds
that
he
has
an
added
problem
to
solve
mysterious
death.william
's
character
is
the
delight
of
this
medieval
novel
.
he
thinks
he
questions
he
reasons
he
believes
and
has
faith
but
he
also
has
doubts
and
uses
science
and
his
brain
.
he
is
a
pre-renaissance
man
.
with
william
on
his
trek
is
a
novice
adso
the
narrator
of
the
story
putting
pen
to
paper
later
in
life
.
he
is
william
's
sounding
board
and
sometime-accomplice.so
much
happens
that
is
of
the
mind
here
and
eco
is
indeed
brilliant
at
recreating
ecclesiastical
arguments
for
and
against
laughter
poverty
and
degrees
of
poverty
and
christ
's
views
on
poverty
.
at
first
i
was
intimidated
but
gradually
i
realized
what
these
arguments
were
about
.
power
...
the
oldest
source
of
argument
in
the
world
.
i
was
interested
to
see
the
familiar
name
of
aristotle
raised
after
reading
the
unfamiliar
names
of
the
many
heretics
.
and
then
there
are
the
murders
...
what
purpose
could
there
be
for
them
.
says
william
''
in
that
face
deformed
by
hatred
of
philosophy
i
saw
for
the
first
time
the
portrait
of
the
antichrist
...
.the
antichrist
can
be
born
from
piety
itself
from
excessive
love
of
god
or
of
the
truth
as
the
heretic
is
born
from
the
saint
and
the
possessed
from
the
seer
.
fear
prophets
adso
and
those
prepared
to
die
for
the
truth
for
as
a
rule
they
make
many
others
die
with
them
often
before
them
at
times
instead
of
them

and
as
i
can
only
piece
together
a
few
latin
words
and
stretch
meaning
from
the
context
i
come
to
my
own
conclusions
based
on
what
i
have
read
and
learned
in
the
past
as
william
solves
his
case
the
wrong
way
but
with
the
right
answers
.
i
do
n't
read
latin
as
adso
does
n't
read
greek
as
william
does
n't
read
arabic
as
mortal
man
can
never
read
god
's
language
and
so
we
make
our
own
assumptions
based
on
what
we
do
know
.
the
world
's
knowledge
is
constantly
fragmented
and
we
keep
what
we
can
use
we
forget
or
reinvent
.
one
day
the
library
will
burn
the
database
will
fail
and
the
only
books
that
will
matter
are
the
ones
we
've
read
.
and
who
can
read
what
books
here
i
begin
my
ode
to
the
joys
of
reading
two
books
simultaneouslyi
picked
up
this
book
reading
with
oprah
the
book
club
that
changed
america
not
because
i
am
necessarily
interested
in
the
particular
books
that
comprise
oprah
's
list
but
because
the
phenomenon
as
a
bookseller
intrigues
me
.
my
own
attitude
as
book
snob
was
outed
when
cormac
mccarthy
joined
her
ranks
and
i
felt
the
mass
public
did
n't
deserve
his
offering
.
you
have
to
earn
an
appreciation
for
mccarthy
.
what
the
hell
do
i
mean
by
that
here
watch
me
struggle
with
my
conscience
if
you
tell
me
your
favorite
author
is
picoult
my
recommendation
will
never
be
mccarthy
even
though
i
feel
he
'll
always
be
a
more
satisfying
read
.
but
you
're
not
ready
.
you
do
n't
want
to
reorganize
the
furniture
in
your
head
you
just
want
a
touch
of
color
on
your
sofa
.
and
that
's
ok.
moving
furniture
is
a
lot
of
hard
work
and
i
like
an
easy
read
between
moves
.
but
my
favorite
reason
to
read
is
to
change
that
's
not
everyone
's
reason
.
what
does
this
have
to
do
with
name
of
the
rose
you
ask
because
there
was
this
monk
600
years
ago
running
oprah
's
book
club
and
he
did
n't
want
mccarthy
i
mean
aristotle
distributed
to
the
masses
because
they
were
n't
going
to
read
it
right
even
if
it
is
in
greek
.
the
book
had
the
ability
to
cause
change
.
this
monk
this
librarian
did
n't
want
to
cause
change
to
innovate
he
wanted
to
preserve
to
archive
.
oprah
says
she
wants
change
but
by
promoting
her
book
list
she
's
preserving
at
the
same
time
labeling
titles
to
the
oprah
cult
garnering
huge
sales
for
her
authors
.
and
now
she
's
quit
.
what
may
have
been
future
oprah
picks
are
hidden
in
the
finis
africae
left
only
for
the
chosen
to
find
.
my
point
i
dunno
.
but
eco
tells
us
that
all
books
are
references
to
other
books
and
now
earth
abidesspeaks
to
me
about
the
end
of
reading
preserving
and
the
boy
who
harnessed
the
wind
creating
currents
of
electricity
and
hope
speaks
to
me
about
the
salvation
of
reading
innovation
and
every
damn
thing
i
read
reminds
me
why
i
read
and
why
the
book
i
have
n't
read
yet
is
going
to
make
the
book
i
just
read
even
better
.
i
'm
filling
in
the
context
with
my
own
collection
of
fragments
and
the
story
is
told
and
told
again
and
when
i
'm
ready
i
'm
going
to
move
the
sofa
.

what
is
love
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
neither
man
nor
devil
nor
any
thing
that
i
hold
as
suspect
as
love
for
it
penetrates
the
soul
more
than
any
other
thing
.
nothing
exists
that
so
fills
and
binds
the
heart
as
love
does
.
therefore
unless
you
have
those
weapons
that
subdue
it
the
soul
plunges
through
love
into
an
immense
abyss
