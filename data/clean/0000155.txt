captain
jack
sparrow
is
caught
up
in
another
tangled
web
of
supernatural
intrigue
.
although
the
curse
of
the
black
pearl
has
been
lifted
an
even
more
terrifying
threat
looms
over
its
captain
and
scurvy
crew
it
turns
out
that
jack
owes
a
blood
debt
to
the
legendary
davy
jones
ruler
of
the
ocean
depths
who
captains
the
ghostly
flying
dutchman
which
no
other
ship
can
match
in
speed
and
stealth
.
unless
the
ever-crafty
jack
figures
a
cunning
way
out
of
this
faustian
pact
he
will
be
cursed
to
an
afterlife
of
eternal
servitude
and
damnation
in
the
service
of
jones
.
this
startling
development
interrupts
the
wedding
plans
of
will
turner
and
elizabeth
swann
who
once
again
find
themselves
thrust
into
jack
's
misadventures
leading
to
escalating
confrontations
with
sea
monsters
very
unfriendly
islanders
flamboyant
soothsayer
tia
dalma
and
even
the
mysterious
appearance
of
will
's
long-lost
father
bootstrap
bill
.
meanwhile
ruthless
pirate
hunter
lord
cutler
beckett
of
the
east
india
trading
company
sets
his
sights
on
retrieving
the
fabled
``
dead
man
's
chest
.
''
according
to
legend
whoever
possesses
the
dead
man
's
chest
gains
control
of
davy
jones
and
beckett
intends
to
use
this
awesome
power
to
destroy
every
last
pirate
of
the
caribbean
once
and
for
all
.
for
times
are
changing
on
the
high
seas
with
businessmen
and
bureaucrats
becoming
the
true
pirates
--
and
freewheeling
fun-loving
buccaneers
like

'fifteen
men
on
the
dead

's
chest
yo-ho-ho
and
a
bottle
of
rum
drink
and
the
devil
had
done
for
the
rest
yo-ho-ho
and
a
bottle
of
rum'who
'd
of
thought
a
movie
based
on
a
theme
park
and
pirates
would
be
so
successful
that
it
would
garner
a
sequel
.
a
sequel
that
was
so
so
so
utterly
huge
in
production
values
it
makes
perfect
sense
that
it
would
fail
to
live
up
to
its
predecessor
.
the
old
lesson
hollywood
never
learns
making
things
bigger
and
flashier
does
n't
always
mean
it
will
be
better.the
plot
oh
geez
where
to
begin
.
this
is
the
main
issue
with
this
franchise
which
begun
in
this
sequel
only
to
get
worse
in
the
third
film
.
the
story
becomes
so
convoluted
and
twisty
its
hard
to
keep
up
and
this
is
a
disney
film
.
put
very
simply
...
most
of
the
characters
are
all
after
various
bit
n
pieces
including
'davy
jones
'
heart
'sparrow
's
'
compass
and
the
black
pearl
.
each
character
has
their
own
reason
for
needing
each
item
and
most
of
these
reasons
intertwine
with
each
other
at
some
point
oh
and
old
characters
come
back
into
the
fray.the
plot
is
the
first
film
was
pretty
straight
forward
i
'm
not
saying
simple
is
best
but
it
was
easy
to
swallow
.
this
film
kicks
off
relatively
well
with
the
characters
we
know
in
trouble
for
helping
sparrow
a
deal
is
set
a
plan
underway
and
everybody
knows
who
is
doing
what
and
why
.
the
trouble
is
as
the
film
progresses
sub
plots
pop
up
new
characters
enter
with
their
own
story
arcs
old
characters
come
back
with
more
story
arcs
plans
change
and
double
crossing
ensues
.
i
ca
n't
deny
it
becomes
tricky
but
in
the
end
it
is
decipherable
and
when
you
think
about
it
its
quite
good.so
once
you
've
got
your
head
around
the
plot
you
do
tend
to
notice
how
big
everything
has
become
.
the
prison
sparrow
escapes
from
at
the
start
looks
very
similar
to
some
kind
of
fortress
you
'd
expect
to
see
in
a
tolkien
story
.
the
entire
early
cannibal
infested
island
part
of
the
film
really
does
show
how
the
franchise
took
a
swing
for
the
worst
.
sparrow
norrington
and
turner
break
out
into
a
three
way
fight
over
jones
chest
which
lasts
for
at
least
10-15
minutes
displays
way
way
too
much
slapstick
completely
unbelievable
cartoon
stunts
that
detach
you
from
the
film
and
the
trio
end
up
covering
half
the
island
whilst
battling
.
in
short
the
whole
sequence
was
n't
needed
it
was
completely
overblown
and
merely
flashy
filler
it
bared
no
importance
to
the
plot
whatsoever
...
and
this
is
what
you
will
come
to
expect
from
the
franchise
thereafter.now
of
course
we
know
this
franchise
is
a
comedy
of
sorts
a
period
set
comedy
action
thriller
for
everyone
to
enjoy
.
the
first
film
had
a
nice
balance
of
that
plus
some
supernatural
fantasy
that
really
worked
well
.
this
sequel
added
that
horrendous
cartoonish
hijinx
that
totally
tore
you
away
from
any
suspension
of
disbelief
because
it
went
beyond
that
into
a
pure
hokey
farce.on
top
of
the
ludicrous
tomfoolery
now
on
show
this
film
has
easily
had
much
more
creative
influence
from
the
classic
videogame
the
secret
of
monkey
island
.
if
you
know
the
game
its
quite
plain
to
see
really
the
cannibal
island
at
the
start
the
murky
misty
swampy
location
where
the
team
meet
voodoo
priestess
'tia
dalma
'
and
of
course
that
character
in
her
entirety
plus
the
similarity
jones
has
to
'lechuck
'
in
terms
of
evil
behaviour
the
supernatural
and
looks.it
is
a
shame
because
the
film
is
a
good
fantasy
with
some
gorgeous
visuals
both
cgi
and
real
time
.
davy
jones
and
his
crew
are
incredible
a
real
sight
to
behold
especially
jones
squid-like
face
of
course
.
its
amazing
to
actually
see
cgi
that
looks
so
good
you
think
its
a
real
makeup
job
.
the
other
crew
members
are
also
so
vividly
imaginative
and
well
crafted
every
scene
with
these
fishy
dogs
was
really
great
fun
i
was
always
looking
out
for
different
types
of
mutants
in
the
background
.
i
really
liked
their
vessel
the
dutchman
and
the
war
torn
barnacle
covered
ghost
ship
appearance
it
was
given
much
like
the
pearl
and
its
ghostly
shrouds
of
mist
n
fog
and
of
course
the
kraken
was
a
fun
nautical
myth
to
include
if
somewhat
unoriginal
and
not
too
good
on
the
cgi
front.its
still
a
fun
film
which
is
saved
by
the
british
actors
and
their
astoundingly
fun
well
spoken
pomposity
that
and
the
excellent
effects
on
jones
and
his
undead
crew
.
the
finale
for
sparrow
is
an
exciting
cliffhanger
even
though
you
know
he
will
be
back
its
interesting
to
see
a
group
of
heroes
bickering
and
double
crossing
each
other
instead
of
simply
fighting
together
as
one
unbeatable
team
and
that
supernatural
spice
is
just
right
.
the
plot
difficulties
do
mire
proceedings
but
verbinski
just
about
pulls
it
off
and
manages
to
provide
decent
escapism
