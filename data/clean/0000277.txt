is
the

humble
circumstances

the

revolution

was
born
presleys
career

i
can
guarantee
you
one
thing
-
we
will
never
again
agree
on
anything
as
we
agreed
on
elvis
.
in
celebration
of
presley
's
january
8
birthday
and
his
contributions
to
rock
and
roll
we
chose
10
essential
elvis
presley
songs
.
presley
built
arguably
the
most
impressive
catalog
of
recordings
in
rock
history
so
it
was
understandably
difficult
narrowing
the
list
down
to
10
essential
tracks
.
let
us
know
what
songs
would
be
on
your
list
.
10
essential
elvis
presley
songs
1
.
``
thats
all
right
''
released
in
the
summer
of
1954
``
that
's
all
right
''
was
presley
's
first
commercial
single
and
a
fairly
faithful
version
of
''
that
's
all
right
mama
''
the
uptempo
blues
number
originally
recorded
by
arthur
``
big
boy
''
crudup
.
the
song
was
recorded
``
live
''
at
sam
phillips
'
memphis
recording
service
with
presley
on
acoustic
guitar
and
vocals
scotty
moore
on
electric
guitar
and
bill
black
on
upright
bass
and
released
on
phillips
'
sun
records
.
this
is
arguably
where
the
legend
of
elvis
presley
took
root
his
intensity
driving
the
track
and
hinting
at
the
presleymania
that
was
to
come
.
2
.
``
mystery
train
''
presley
's
reworking
of
the
song
written
by
sam
phillips
and
junior
parker
and
originally
recorded
by
junior
's
blue
flames
was
the
b-side
to
1955
's
``
i
forgot
to
remember
to
forget
.
''
like
``
that
's
all
right
''
the
rollicking
``
mystery
train
''
heralded
the
emergence
of
rockabilly
though
presley
's
trademark
emoting
carries
a
lament
for
his
``
baby
's
''
departure
that
made
for
a
memorable
counterpoint
to
the
arrangement
.
3
.
``
heartbreak
hotel
''
by
1956
presley
had
moved
to
rca
victor
and
his
first
release
under
the
new
label
``
heartbreak
hotel
''
would
also
be
the
first
of
many
recordings
to
top
billboard
's
top
100
chart
.
although
on
rca
producer
steve
sholes
wanted
to
recapture
the
``
sun
sound
''
and
enlisted
guitarist
scotty
moore
bassist
bill
black
drummer
dj
fontana
guitarist
chet
atkins
pianist
floyd
kramer
and
three
members
of
the
jordanaires
on
backing
vocals
for
the
sessions
that
produced
``
heartbreak
hotel
.
''
led
by
presley
's
signature
baritone
``
heartbreak
hotel
''
was
deemed
the
number
one
single
of
the
year
by
billboard
in
1956
an
unlikely
feat
for
a
song
about
a
near-suicidal
loner
.
4
.
``
do
n't
be
cruel
''
with
its
swinging
groove
harmonized
backing
vocals
and
presley
's
famous
hiccup
``
do
n't
be
cruel
''
became
a
sensation
following
its
release
in
the
summer
of
1956
.
the
recording
of
``
do
n't
be
cruel
''
''
hound
dog
''
was
number
one
for
11
weeks
among
the
longest
number
one
runs
in
the
rock
era
.
brooklyn
songwriter
otis
blackwell
whose
credits
would
later
include
``
return
to
sender
''
and
``
all
shook
up
''
among
others
composed
the
song
and
presley
injected
it
with
the
vitality
it
needed
to
reach
the
top
of
the
charts
.
5
.
``
jailhouse
rock
''
the
title
track
performance
of
jailhouse
rock
was
the
highlight
of
presley
's
third
film
.
the
movie
premiered
on
october
21
1957
the
same
day
the
title
track
went
to
the
top
of
the
billboard
charts
where
it
remained
for
seven
weeks
.
penned
by
the
team
of
jerry
leiber
and
mike
stoller
who
also
composed
the
enormously
successful
``
hound
dog
''
originally
recorded
by
willie
mae
``
big
mama
''
thornton
the
song
resonated
beyond
the
u.s.
becoming
the
first
record
ever
to
enter
the
british
singles
chart
at
number
one
.
presley
's
charisma
shined
on
the
recording
and
the
song
's
two-chord
riff
is
among
rock
's
most
indelible
moments
.
6
.
``
viva
las
vegas
''
viva
las
vegas
is
considered
one
of
presley
's
best
movies
if
not
the
best
.
the
title
track
of
the
1964
film
starring
presley
as
lucky
jackson
alongside
ann-margret
as
rusty
martin
was
a
lively
romp
thats
lyrical
sentiment
i
'm

i

have
me
some

last
dime
if
i
wind
up
broke
up
well
i
'll
always
remember
that
i
had
a
swingin
'
time
was
perfectly
echoed
in
the
song
's
frenetic
percussive
charge
and
presley
's
convincing
passionate
delivery
.

.
``
how
great
thou
art
''
''
how
great
thou
art
''
was
the
title
track
of
presley
's
second
gospel
lp
released
in
early
1967
.
it
was
recorded
in
nashville
and
won
a
grammy
that
year
for
best
sacred
performance
.
presley
was
a
superb
gospel
singer
and
this
song
really
captured
his
passion
and
vocal
range
.
it
was
a
staple
of
his
live
shows
throughout
the
1970s
.
8
.
``
in
the
ghetto
''
the
stirring
``
in
the
ghetto
''
featured
presley
's
expressive
tender
vocals
as
the
vehicle
for
a
narrative
about
a
young
boy
's
life
of
poverty
in
the
inner-city
.
the
song
written
by
mac
davis
features
suitably
evocative
instrumentation
and
became
the
springboard
for
presley
's
comeback
in
1969
peaking
at
number
three
during
a
13-week
run
on
the
billboard
hot
100
charts
.
the
1969
american
sound
studio
sessions
in
memphis
with
producer
chips
moman
found
presley
artistically
awakened
.
the
resulting
soul
material
formed
from
elvis
in
memphis
including
the
gospel-rooted
highlight
``
in
the
ghetto
.
''
9
.
``
suspicious
minds
''
''
suspicious
minds
''
was
one
of
the
better
tunes
prepared
it
was
written
by
mark
james
for
presley
's
january
1969
recording
dates
at
american
sound
studio
in
memphis
the
same
sessions
that
produced
``
in
the
ghetto
''
the
city
that
gave
presley
his
start
in
the
previous
decade
.
the
song
found
presley
embracing
a
sound
that
owed
more
to
soul
and
rb
than
rock
and
country
as
his
bellowing
voice
powered
the
ballad
.
the
effort
was
enlivened
by
backing
vocals
ronnie
milsap
and
jeannie
greene
and
a
vibrant
horn
section
.
it
would
become
presley
's
first
u.s.
chart-topper
since
``
good
luck
charm
''
seven
years
earlier
and
his
17th
and
final
number
one
hit
holding
that
position
the
week
of
november
1
1969
.

.
``
burning
love
''
the
driving
``
burning
love
''
was
written
by
dennis
linde
and
among
the
final
rock
and
roll
numbers
recorded
by
presley
.
released
in
1972
it
featured
boogie
piano
horn-laden
chorus
choir-style
vocals
pounding
drums
and
fretwork
by
virtuoso
guitarist
james
burton
.
presley
's
singing
infuses
the
song
with
an
edginess
and
the
``
hunka
hunka
burning
love
''
coda
closed
the
song
on
a
punchy
gospel-inspired
note
.
the
song
peaked
at
number
two
on
the
billboard
hot
100
on
the
week
of
october
