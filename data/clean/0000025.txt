a
long-expected
party
when
mr.
bilbo
baggins
of
bag
end
announced
that
he
would
shortly
be
celebrating
his
eleventy-first
birthday
with
a
party
of
special
magnificence
there
was
much
talk
and
excitement
in
hobbiton
.
bilbo
was
very
rich
and
very
peculiar
and
had
been
the
wonder
of
the
shire
for
sixty
years
ever
since
his
remarkable
disappearance
and
unexpected
return
.
the
riches
he
had
brought
back
from
his
travels
had
now
become
a
local
legend
and
it
was
popularly
believed
whatever
the
old
folk
might
say
that
the
hill
at
bag
end
was
full
of
tunnels
stuffed
with
treasure
.
and
if
that
was
not
enough
for
fame
there
was
also
his
prolonged
vigour
to
marvel
at
.
time
wore
on
but
it
seemed
to
have
little
effect
on
mr.
baggins
.
at
ninety
he
was
much
the
same
as
at
fifty
.
at
ninety-nine
they
began
to
call
him
well-preserved
but
unchanged
would
have
been
nearer
the
mark
.
there
were
some
that
shook
their
heads
and
thought
this
was
too
much
of
a
good
thing
it
seemed
unfair
that
anyone
should
possess
apparently
perpetual
youth
as
well
as
reputedly
inexhaustible
wealth
.
'it
will
have
to
be
paid
for
'
they
said
.
'it
is
n't
natural
and
trouble
will
come
of
it'
but
so
far
trouble
had
not
come
and
as
mr.
baggins
was
generous
with
his
money
most
people
were
willing
to
forgive
him
his
oddities
and
his
good
fortune
.
he
remained
on
visiting
terms
with
his
relatives
except
of
course
the
sackville-bagginses
and
he
had
many
devoted
admirers
among
the
hobbits
of
poor
and
unimportant
families
.
but
he
had
no
close
friends
until
some
of
his
younger
cousins
began
to
grow
up
.
the
eldest
of
these
and
bilbo
's
favourite
was
young
frodo
baggins
.
when
bilbo
was
ninety-nine
he
adopted
frodo
as
his
heir
and
brought
him
to
live
at
bag
end
and
the
hopes
of
the
sackville-
bagginses
were
finally
dashed
.
bilbo
and
frodo
happened
to
have
the
same
birthday
september
22nd
.
'you
had
better
come
and
live
here
frodo
my
lad
'
said
bilbo
one
day
'and
then
we
can
celebrate
our
birthday-parties
comfortably
together
.
'
at
that
time
frodo
was
still
in
his
tweens
as
the
hobbits
called
the
irresponsible
twenties
between
childhood
and
coming
of
age
at
thirty-three
.
twelve
more
years
passed
.
each
year
the
bagginses
had
given
very
lively
combined
birthday-parties
at
bag
end
but
now
it
was
understood
that
something
quite
exceptional
was
being
planned
for
that
autumn
.
bilbo
was
going
to
be
eleventy-one
111
a
rather
curious
number
and
a
very
respectable
age
for
a
hobbit
the
old
took
himself
had
only
reached
130
and
frodo
was
going
to
be
thirty-
three
33
an
important
number
the
date
of
his
'coming
of
age
'
.
tongues
began
to
wag
in
hobbiton
and
bywater
and
rumour
of
the
coming
event
travelled
all
over
the
shire
.
the
history
and
character
of
mr.
bilbo
baggins
became
once
again
the
chief
topic
of
conversation
and
the
older
folk
suddenly
found
their
reminiscences
in
welcome
demand
.
no
one
had
a
more
attentive
audience
than
old
ham
gamgee
commonly
known
as
the
gaffer
.
he
held
forth
at
the
ivy
bush
a
small
inn
on
the
bywater
road
and
he
spoke
with
some
authority
for
he
had
tended
the
garden
at
bag
end
for
forty
years
and
had
helped
old
holman
in
the
same
job
before
that
.
now
that
he
was
himself
growing
old
and
stiff
in
the
joints
the
job
was
mainly
carried
on
by
his
youngest
son
sam
gamgee
.
both
father
and
son
were
on
very
friendly
terms
with
bilbo
and
frodo
.
they
lived
on
the
hill
itself
in
number
3
bagshot
row
just
below
bag
end
.
'a
very
nice
well-spoken
gentlehobbit
is
mr.
bilbo
as
i
've
always
said
'
the
gaffer
declared
.
with
perfect
truth
for
bilbo
was
very
polite
to
him
calling
him
'master
hamfast
'
and
consulting
him
constantly
upon
the
growing
of
vegetables
â
in
the
matter
of
'roots
'
especially
potatoes
the
gaffer
was
recognized
as
the
leading
authority
by
all
in
the
neighbourhood
including
himself
.
'but
what
about
this
frodo
that
lives
with
him
'
asked
old
noakes
of
bywater
.
'baggins
is
his
name
but
he
's
more
than
half
a
brandybuck
they
say
.
it
beats
me
why
any
baggins
of
hobbiton
should
go
looking
for
a
wife
away
there
in
buckland
where
folks
are
so
queer
.
'
'and
no
wonder
they
're
queer
'
put
in
daddy
twofoot
the
gaffer
's
next-door
neighbour
'if
they
live
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
brandywine
river
and
right
agin
the
old
forest
.
that
's
a
dark
bad
place
if
half
the
tales
be
true
.
'
'you
're
right
dad
'
said
the
gaffer
.
'not
that
the
brandybucks
of
buckland
live
in
the
old
forest
but
they
're
a
queer
breed
seemingly
.
they
fool
about
with
boats
on
that
big
river
â
and
that
is
n't
natural
.
small
wonder
that
trouble
came
of
it
i
say
.
but
be
that
as
it
may
mr.
frodo
is
as
nice
a
young
hobbit
as
you
could
wish
to
meet
.
very
much
like
mr.
bilbo
and
in
more
than
looks
.
after
all
his
father
was
a
baggins
.
a
decent
respectable
hobbit
was
mr.
drogo
baggins
there
was
never
much
to
tell
of
him
till
he
was
drownded
.
'
'drownded
'
said
several
voices
.
they
had
heard
this
and
other
darker
rumours
before
of
course
but
hobbits
have
a
passion
for
family
history
and
they
were
ready
to
hear
it
again
.
'well
so
they
say
'
said
the
gaffer
.
'you
see
mr.
drogo
he
married
poor
miss
primula
brandybuck
.
she
was
our
mr.
bilbo
's
first
cousin
on
the
mother
's
side
her
mother
being
the
youngest
of
the
old
took
's
daughters
and
mr.
drogo
was
his
second
cousin
.
so
mr.
frodo
is
his
first
and
second
cousin
once
removed
either
way
as
the
saying
is
if
you
follow
me
.
and
mr.
drogo
was
staying
at
brandy
hall
with
his
father-in-law
old
master
gorbadoc
as
he
often
did
after
his
marriage
him
being
partial
to
his
vittles
and
old
gorbadoc
keeping
a
mighty
generous
table
and
he
went
out
boating
on
the
brandywine
river
and
he
and
his
wife
were
drownded
and
poor
mr.
frodo
only
a
child
and
all
.
'
'i
've
heard
they
went
on
the
water
after
dinner
in
the
moonlight
'
said
old
noakes
'and
it
was
drogo
's
weight
as
sunk
the
boat
.
'
'and
i
heard
she
pushed
him
in
and
he
pulled
her
in
after
him
'
said
sandyman
the
hobbiton
miller
.
'you
should
n't
listen
to
all
you
hear
sandyman
'
said
the
gaffer
who
did
not
much
like
the
miller
.
'there
is
n't
no
call
to
go
talking
of
pushing
and
pulling
.
boats
are
quite
tricky
enough
for
those
that
sit
still
without
looking
further
for
the
cause
of
trouble
.
anyway
there
was
this
mr.
frodo
left
an
orphan
and
stranded
as
you
might
say
among
those
queer
bucklanders
being
brought
up
anyhow
in
brandy
hall
.
a
regular
warren
by
all
accounts
.
old
master
gorbadoc
never
had
fewer
than
a
couple
of
hundred
relations
in
the
place
.
mr.
bilbo
never
did
a
kinder
deed
than
when
he
brought
the
lad
back
to
live
among
decent
folk
.
'but
i
reckon
it
was
a
nasty
shock
for
those
sackville-
bagginses
.
they
thought
they
were
going
to
get
bag
end
that
time
when
he
went
off
and
was
thought
to
be
dead
.
and
then
he
comes
back
and
orders
them
off
and
he
goes
on
living
and
living
and
never
looking
a
day
older
bless
him
and
suddenly
he
produces
an
heir
and
has
all
the
papers
made
out
proper
.
the
sackville-bagginses
wo
n't
never
see
the
inside
of
bag
end
now
or
it
is
to
be
hoped
not
.
'
'there
's
a
tidy
bit
of
money
tucked
away
up
there
i
hear
tell
'
said
a
stranger
a
visitor
on
business
from
michel
delving
in
the
westfarthing
.
'all
the
top
of
your
hill
is
full
of
tunnels
packed
with
chests
of
gold
and
silver
and
jools
by
what
i
've
heard
.
'
'then
you
've
heard
more
than
i
can
speak
to
'
answered
the
gaffer
.
i
know
nothing
about
jools
.
mr.
bilbo
is
free
with
his
money
and
there
seems
no
lack
of
it
but
i
know
of
no
tunnel-making
.
i
saw
mr.
bilbo
when
he
came
back
a
matter
of
sixty
years
ago
when
i
was
a
lad
.
i
'd
not
long
come
prentice
to
old
holman
him
being
my
dad
's
cousin
but
he
had
me
up
at
bag
end
helping
him
to
keep
folks
from
trampling
and
trapessing
all
over
the
garden
while
the
sale
was
on
.
and
in
the
middle
of
it
all
mr.
bilbo
comes
up
the
hill
with
a
pony
and
some
mighty
big
bags
and
a
couple
of
chests
.
i
do
n't
doubt
they
were
mostly
full
of
treasure
he
had
picked
up
in
foreign
parts
where
there
be
mountains
of
gold
they
say
but
there
was
n't
enough
to
fill
tunnels
.
but
my
lad
sam
will
know
more
about
that
.
he
's
in
and
out
of
bag
end
.
crazy
about
stories
of
the
old
days
he
is
and
he
listens
to
all
mr.
bilbo
's
tales
.
mr.
bilbo
has
learned
him
his
letters
â
meaning
no
harm
mark
you
and
i
hope
no
harm
will
come
of
it
.
'elves
and
dragons
i
says
to
him
.
'cabbages
and
potatoes
are
better
for
me
and
you
.
do
n't
go
getting
mixed
up
in
the
business
of
your
betters
or
you
'll
land
in
trouble
too
big
for
you
'
i
says
to
him
.
and
i
might
say
it
to
others
'
he
added
with
a
look
at
the
stranger
and
the
miller
.
but
the
gaffer
did
not
convince
his
audience
.
the
legend
of
bilbo
's
wealth
was
now
too
firmly
fixed
in
the
minds
of
the
younger
generation
of
hobbits
.
'ah
but
he
has
likely
enough
been
adding
to
what
he
brought
at
first
'
argued
the
miller
voicing
common
opinion
.
'he
's
often
away
from
home
.
and
look
at
the
outlandish
folk
that
visit
him
dwarves
coming
at
night
and
that
old
wandering
conjuror
gandalf
and
all
.
you
can
say
what
you
like
gaffer
but
bag
end
's
a
queer
place
and
its
folk
are
queerer
.
'
'and
you
can
say
what
you
like
about
what
you
know
no
more
of
than
you
do
of
boating
mr.
sandyman
'
retorted
the
gaffer
disliking
the
miller
even
more
than
usual
.
'if
that
's
being
queer
then
we
could
do
with
a
bit
more
queerness
in
these
parts
.
there
's
some
not
far
away
that
would
n't
offer
a
pint
of
beer
to
a
friend
if
they
lived
in
a
hole
with
golden
walls
.
but
they
do
things
proper
at
bag
end
.
our
sam
says
that
everyone
's
going
to
be
invited
to
the
party
and
there
's
going
to
be
presents
mark
you
presents
for
all
â
this
very
month
as
is
.
'
that
very
month
was
september
and
as
fine
as
you
could
ask
.
a
day
or
two
later
a
rumour
probably
started
by
the
knowledgeable
sam
was
spread
about
that
there
were
going
to
be
fireworks
â
fireworks
what
is
more
such
as
had
not
been
seen
in
the
shire
for
nigh
on
a
century
not
indeed
since
the
old
took
died
.
days
passed
and
the
day
drew
nearer
.
an
odd-looking
waggon
laden
with
odd-looking
packages
rolled
into
hobbiton
one
evening
and
toiled
up
the
hill
to
bag
end
.
the
startled
hobbits
peered
out
of
lamplit
doors
to
gape
at
it
.
it
was
driven
by
outlandish
folk
singing
strange
songs
dwarves
with
long
beards
and
deep
hoods
.
a
few
of
them
remained
at
bag
end
.
at
the
end
of
the
second
week
in
september
a
cart
came
in
through
bywater
from
the
direction
of
the
brandywine
bridge
in
broad
daylight
.
an
old
man
was
driving
it
all
alone
.
he
wore
a
tall
pointed
blue
hat
a
long
grey
cloak
and
a
silver
scarf
.
he
had
a
long
white
beard
and
bushy
eyebrows
that
stuck
out
beyond
the
brim
of
his
hat
.
small
hobbit-children
ran
after
the
cart
all
through
hobbiton
and
right
up
the
hill
.
it
had
a
cargo
of
fireworks
as
they
rightly
guessed
.
at
bilbo
's
front
door
the
old
man
began
to
unload
there
were
great
bundles
of
fireworks
of
all
sorts
and
shapes
each
labelled
with
a
large
red
g
and
the
elf-rune
.
that
was
gandalf
's
mark
of
course
and
the
old
man
was
gandalf
the
wizard
whose
fame
in
the
shire
was
due
mainly
to
his
skill
with
fires
smokes
and
lights
.
his
real
business
was
far
more
difficult
and
dangerous
but
the
shire-folk
knew
nothing
about
it
.
to
them
he
was
just
one
of
the
'attractions
'
at
the
party
.
hence
the
excitement
of
the
hobbit-children
.
'g
for
grand
'
they
shouted
and
the
old
man
smiled
.
they
knew
him
by
sight
though
he
only
appeared
in
hobbiton
occasionally
and
never
stopped
long
but
neither
they
nor
any
but
the
oldest
of
their
elders
had
seen
one
of
his
firework
displays
â
they
now
belonged
to
the
legendary
past
.
when
the
old
man
helped
by
bilbo
and
some
dwarves
had
finished
unloading
.
bilbo
gave
a
few
pennies
away
but
not
a
single
squib
or
cracker
was
forthcoming
to
the
disappointment
of
the
onlookers
.
'run
away
now
'
said
gandalf
.
'you
will
get
plenty
when
the
time
comes
.
'
then
he
disappeared
inside
with
bilbo
and
the
door
was
shut
.
the
young
hobbits
stared
at
the
door
in
vain
for
a
while
and
then
made
off
feeling
that
the
day
of
the
party
would
never
come
.
inside
bag
end
bilbo
and
gandalf
were
sitting
at
the
open
window
of
a
small
room
looking
out
west
on
to
the
garden
.
the
late
afternoon
was
bright
and
peaceful
.
the
flowers
glowed
red
and
golden
snap-dragons
and
sun-flowers
and
nasturtiums
trailing
all
over
the
turf
walls
and
peeping
in
at
the
round
windows
.
'how
bright
your
garden
looks
'
said
gandalf
.
'yes
'
said
bilbo
.
'i
am
very
fond
indeed
of
it
and
of
all
the
dear
old
shire
but
i
think
i
need
a
holiday
.
'
'you
mean
to
go
on
with
your
plan
then'
'i
do
.
i
made
up
my
mind
months
ago
and
i
have
n't
changed
it
.
'
'very
well
.
it
is
no
good
saying
any
more
.
stick
to
your
plan
â
your
whole
plan
mind
â
and
i
hope
it
will
turn
out
for
the
best
for
you
and
for
all
of
us
.
'
'i
hope
so
.
anyway
i
mean
to
enjoy
myself
on
thursday
and
have
my
little
joke
.
'
'who
will
laugh
i
wonder
'
said
gandalf
shaking
his
head
.
'we
shall
see
'
said
bilbo
.
the
next
day
more
carts
rolled
up
the
hill
and
still
more
carts
.
there
might
have
been
some
grumbling
about
'dealing
locally
'
but
that
very
week
orders
began
to
pour
out
of
bag
end
for
every
kind
of
provision
commodity
or
luxury
that
could
be
obtained
in
hobbiton
or
bywater
or
anywhere
in
the
neighbourhood
.
people
became
enthusiastic
and
they
began
to
tick
off
the
days
on
the
calendar
and
they
watched
eagerly
for
the
postman
hoping
for
invitations
.
before
long
the
invitations
began
pouring
out
and
the
hobbiton
post-office
was
blocked
and
the
bywater
post-office
was
snowed
under
and
voluntary
assistant
postmen
were
called
for
.
there
was
a
constant
stream
of
them
going
up
the
hill
carrying
hundreds
of
polite
variations
on
thank
you
i
shall
certainly
come
.
a
notice
appeared
on
the
gate
at
bag
end
no
admittance
except
on
party
business
.
even
those
who
had
or
pretended
to
have
party
business
were
seldom
allowed
inside
.
bilbo
was
busy
writing
invitations
ticking
off
answers
packing
up
presents
and
making
some
private
preparations
of
his
own
.
from
the
time
of
gandalf
's
arrival
he
remained
hidden
from
view
.
one
morning
the
hobbits
woke
to
find
the
large
field
south
of
bilbo
's
front
door
covered
with
ropes
and
poles
for
tents
and
pavilions
.
a
special
entrance
was
cut
into
the
bank
leading
to
the
road
and
wide
steps
and
a
large
white
gate
were
built
there
.
the
three
hobbit-families
of
bagshot
row
adjoining
the
field
were
intensely
interested
and
generally
envied
.
old
gaffer
gamgee
stopped
even
pretending
to
work
in
his
garden
.
the
tents
began
to
go
up
.
there
was
a
specially
large
pavilion
so
big
that
the
tree
that
grew
in
the
field
was
right
inside
it
and
stood
proudly
near
one
end
at
the
head
of
the
chief
table
.
lanterns
were
hung
on
all
its
branches
.
more
promising
still
to
the
hobbits
'
mind
an
enormous
open-air
kitchen
was
erected
in
the
north
corner
of
the
field
.
a
draught
of
cooks
from
every
inn
and
eating-house
for
miles
around
arrived
to
supplement
the
dwarves
and
other
odd
folk
that
were
quartered
at
bag
end
.
excitement
rose
to
its
height
.
then
the
weather
clouded
over
.
that
was
on
wednesday
the
eve
of
the
party
.
anxiety
was
intense
.
then
thursday
september
the
22nd
actually
dawned
.
the
sun
got
up
the
clouds
vanished
flags
were
unfurled
and
the
fun
began
.
bilbo
baggins
called
it
a
party
but
it
was
really
a
variety
of
entertainments
rolled
into
one
.
practically
everybody
living
near
was
invited
.
a
very
few
were
overlooked
by
accident
but
as
they
turned
up
all
the
same
that
did
not
matter
.
many
people
from
other
parts
of
the
shire
were
also
asked
and
there
were
even
a
few
from
outside
the
borders
.
bilbo
met
the
guests
and
additions
at
the
new
white
gate
in
person
.
he
gave
away
presents
to
all
and
sundry
â
the
latter
were
those
who
went
out
again
by
a
back
way
and
came
in
again
by
the
gate
.
hobbits
give
presents
to
other
people
on
their
own
birthdays
.
not
very
expensive
ones
as
a
rule
and
not
so
lavishly
as
on
this
occasion
but
it
was
not
a
bad
system
.
actually
in
hobbiton
and
bywater
every
day
in
the
year
it
was
somebody
's
birthday
so
that
every
hobbit
in
those
parts
had
a
fair
chance
of
at
least
one
present
at
least
once
a
week
.
but
they
never
got
tired
of
them
.
on
this
occasion
the
presents
were
unusually
good
.
the
hobbit-
children
were
so
excited
that
for
a
while
they
almost
forgot
about
eating
.
there
were
toys
the
like
of
which
they
had
never
seen
before
all
beautiful
and
some
obviously
magical
.
many
of
them
had
indeed
been
ordered
a
year
before
and
had
come
all
the
way
from
the
mountain
and
from
dale
and
were
of
real
dwarf-make
.
when
every
guest
had
been
welcomed
and
was
finally
inside
the
gate
there
were
songs
dances
music
games
and
of
course
food
and
drink
.
there
were
three
official
meals
lunch
tea
and
dinner
or
supper
.
but
lunch
and
tea
were
marked
chiefly
by
the
fact
that
at
those
times
all
the
guests
were
sitting
down
and
eating
together
.
at
other
times
there
were
merely
lots
of
people
eating
and
drinking
â
continuously
from
elevenses
until
six-thirty
when
the
fireworks
started
.
the
fireworks
were
by
gandalf
they
were
not
only
brought
by
him
but
designed
and
made
by
him
and
the
special
effects
set
pieces
and
flights
of
rockets
were
let
off
by
him
.
but
there
was
also
a
generous
distribution
of
squibs
crackers
backarappers
sparklers
torches
dwarf-candles
elf-fountains
goblin-barkers
and
thunder-claps
.
they
were
all
superb
.
the
art
of
gandalf
improved
with
age
.
there
were
rockets
like
a
flight
of
scintillating
birds
singing
with
sweet
voices
.
there
were
green
trees
with
trunks
of
dark
smoke
their
leaves
opened
like
a
whole
spring
unfolding
in
a
moment
and
their
shining
branches
dropped
glowing
flowers
down
upon
the
astonished
hobbits
disappearing
with
a
sweet
scent
just
before
they
touched
their
upturned
faces
.
there
were
fountains
of
butterflies
that
flew
glittering
into
the
trees
there
were
pillars
of
coloured
fires
that
rose
and
turned
into
eagles
or
sailing
ships
or
a
phalanx
of
flying
swans
there
was
a
red
thunderstorm
and
a
shower
of
yellow
rain
there
was
a
forest
of
silver
spears
that
sprang
suddenly
into
the
air
with
a
yell
like
an
embattled
army
and
came
down
again
into
the
water
with
a
hiss
like
a
hundred
hot
snakes
.
and
there
was
also
one
last
surprise
in
honour
of
bilbo
and
it
startled
the
hobbits
exceedingly
as
gandalf
intended
.
the
lights
went
out
.
a
great
smoke
went
up
.
it
shaped
itself
like
a
mountain
seen
in
the
distance
and
began
to
glow
at
the
summit
.
it
spouted
green
and
scarlet
flames
.
out
flew
a
red-golden
dragon
â
not
life-size
but
terribly
life-like
fire
came
from
his
jaws
his
eyes
glared
down
there
was
a
roar
and
he
whizzed
three
times
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
.
they
all
ducked
and
many
fell
flat
on
their
faces
.
the
dragon
passed
like
an
express
train
turned
a
somersault
and
burst
over
bywater
with
a
deafening
explosion
.
'that
is
the
signal
for
supper
'
said
bilbo
.
the
pain
and
alarm
vanished
at
once
and
the
prostrate
hobbits
leaped
to
their
feet
.
there
was
a
splendid
supper
for
everyone
for
everyone
that
is
except
those
invited
to
the
special
family
dinner-party
.
this
was
held
in
the
great
pavilion
with
the
tree
.
the
invitations
were
limited
to
twelve
dozen
a
number
also
called
by
the
hobbits
one
gross
though
the
word
was
not
considered
proper
to
use
of
people
and
the
guests
were
selected
from
all
the
families
to
which
bilbo
and
frodo
were
related
with
the
addition
of
a
few
special
unrelated
friends
such
as
gandalf
.
many
young
hobbits
were
included
and
present
by
parental
permission
for
hobbits
were
easy-going
with
their
children
in
the
matter
of
sitting
up
late
especially
when
there
was
a
chance
of
getting
them
a
free
meal
.
bringing
up
young
hobbits
took
a
lot
of
provender
.
there
were
many
bagginses
and
boffins
and
also
many
tooks
and
brandybucks
there
were
various
grubbs
relations
of
bilbo
baggins
'
grandmother
and
various
chubbs
connexions
of
his
took
grandfather
and
a
selection
of
burrowses
bolgers
bracegirdles
brockhouses
goodbodies
hornblowers
and
proudfoots
.
some
of
these
were
only
very
distantly
connected
with
bilbo
and
some
of
them
had
hardly
ever
been
in
hobbiton
before
as
they
lived
in
remote
corners
of
the
shire
.
the
sackville-bagginses
were
not
forgotten
.
otho
and
his
wife
lobelia
were
present
.
they
disliked
bilbo
and
detested
frodo
but
so
magnificent
was
the
invitation
card
written
in
golden
ink
that
they
had
felt
it
was
impossible
to
refuse
.
besides
their
cousin
bilbo
had
been
specializing
in
food
for
many
years
and
his
table
had
a
high
reputation
.
all
the
one
hundred
and
forty-four
guests
expected
a
pleasant
feast
though
they
rather
dreaded
the
after-dinner
speech
of
their
host
an
inevitable
item
.
he
was
liable
to
drag
in
bits
of
what
he
called
poetry
and
sometimes
after
a
glass
or
two
would
allude
to
the
absurd
adventures
of
his
mysterious
journey
.
the
guests
were
not
disappointed
they
had
a
very
pleasant
feast
in
fact
an
engrossing
entertainment
rich
abundant
varied
and
prolonged
.
the
purchase
of
provisions
fell
almost
to
nothing
throughout
the
district
in
the
ensuing
weeks
but
as
bilbo
's
catering
had
depleted
the
stocks
of
most
stores
cellars
and
warehouses
for
miles
around
that
did
not
matter
much
.
after
the
feast
more
or
less
came
the
speech
.
most
of
the
company
were
however
now
in
a
tolerant
mood
at
that
delightful
stage
which
they
called
'filling
up
the
corners
'
.
they
were
sipping
their
favourite
drinks
and
nibbling
at
their
favourite
dainties
and
their
fears
were
forgotten
.
they
were
prepared
to
listen
to
anything
and
to
cheer
at
every
full
stop
.
my
dear
people
began
bilbo
rising
in
his
place
.
'hear
hear
hear
'
they
shouted
and
kept
on
repeating
it
in
chorus
seeming
reluctant
to
follow
their
own
advice
.
bilbo
left
his
place
and
went
and
stood
on
a
chair
under
the
illuminated
tree
.
the
light
of
the
lanterns
fell
on
his
beaming
face
the
golden
buttons
shone
on
his
embroidered
silk
waistcoat
.
they
could
all
see
him
standing
waving
one
hand
in
the
air
the
other
was
in
his
trouser-pocket
.
my
dear
bagginses
and
boffins
he
began
again
and
my
dear
tooks
and
brandybucks
and
grubbs
and
chubbs
and
burrowses
and
hornblowers
and
bolgers
bracegirdles
goodbodies
brockhouses
and
proudfoots
.
'proudfeet
'
shouted
an
elderly
hobbit
from
the
back
of
the
pavilion
.
his
name
of
course
was
proudfoot
and
well
merited
his
feet
were
large
exceptionally
furry
and
both
were
on
the
table
.
proudfoots
repeated
bilbo
.
also
my
good
sackville-bagginses
that
i
welcome
back
at
last
to
bag
end
.
today
is
my
one
hundred
and
eleventh
birthday
i
am
eleventy-one
today
'hurray
hurray
many
happy
returns
'
they
shouted
and
they
hammered
joyously
on
the
tables
.
bilbo
was
doing
splendidly
.
this
was
the
sort
of
stuff
they
liked
short
and
obvious
.
i
hope
you
are
all
enjoying
yourselves
as
much
as
i
am
.
deafening
cheers
.
cries
of
yes
and
no
.
noises
of
trumpets
and
horns
pipes
and
flutes
and
other
musical
instruments
.
there
were
as
has
been
said
many
young
hobbits
present
.
hundreds
of
musical
crackers
had
been
pulled
.
most
of
them
bore
the
mark
dale
on
them
which
did
not
convey
much
to
most
of
the
hobbits
but
they
all
agreed
they
were
marvellous
crackers
.
they
contained
instruments
small
but
of
perfect
make
and
enchanting
tones
.
indeed
in
one
corner
some
of
the
young
tooks
and
brandybucks
supposing
uncle
bilbo
to
have
finished
since
he
had
plainly
said
all
that
was
necessary
now
got
up
an
impromptu
orchestra
and
began
a
merry
dance-tune
.
master
everard
took
and
miss
melilot
brandybuck
got
on
a
table
and
with
bells
in
their
hands
began
to
dance
the
springle-ring
a
pretty
dance
but
rather
vigorous
.
but
bilbo
had
not
finished
.
seizing
a
horn
from
a
youngster
near
by
he
blew
three
loud
hoots
.
the
noise
subsided
.
i
shall
not
keep
you
long
he
cried
.
cheers
from
all
the
assembly
.
i
have
called
you
all
together
for
a
purpose
.
something
in
the
way
that
he
said
this
made
an
impression
.
there
was
almost
silence
and
one
or
two
of
the
tooks
pricked
up
their
ears
.
indeed
for
three
purposes
first
of
all
to
tell
you
that
i
am
immensely
fond
of
you
all
and
that
eleventy-one
years
is
too
short
a
time
to
live
among
such
excellent
and
admirable
hobbits
.
tremendous
outburst
of
approval
.
i
do
n't
know
half
of
you
half
as
well
as
i
should
like
and
i
like
less
than
half
of
you
half
as
well
as
you
deserve
.
this
was
unexpected
and
rather
difficult
.
there
was
some
scattered
clapping
but
most
of
them
were
trying
to
work
it
out
and
see
if
it
came
to
a
compliment
.
secondly
to
celebrate
my
birthday
.
cheers
again
.
i
should
say
our
birthday
.
for
it
is
of
course
also
the
birthday
of
my
heir
and
nephew
frodo
.
he
comes
of
age
and
into
his
inheritance
today
.
some
perfunctory
clapping
by
the
elders
and
some
loud
shouts
of
'frodo
frodo
jolly
old
frodo
'
from
the
juniors
.
the
sackville-
bagginses
scowled
and
wondered
what
was
meant
by
'coming
into
his
inheritance
'
.
together
we
score
one
hundred
and
forty-four
.
your
numbers
were
chosen
to
fit
this
remarkable
total
one
gross
if
i
may
use
the
expression
.
no
cheers
.
this
was
ridiculous
.
many
of
his
guests
and
especially
the
sackville-bagginses
were
insulted
feeling
sure
they
had
only
been
asked
to
fill
up
the
required
number
like
goods
in
a
package
.
'one
gross
indeed
vulgar
expression
.
'
it
is
also
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
refer
to
ancient
history
the
anniversary
of
my
arrival
by
barrel
at
esgaroth
on
the
long
lake
though
the
fact
that
it
was
my
birthday
slipped
my
memory
on
that
occasion
.
i
was
only
fifty-one
then
and
birthdays
did
not
seem
so
important
.
the
banquet
was
very
splendid
however
though
i
had
a
bad
cold
at
the
time
i
remember
and
could
only
say
'thag
you
very
buch
'
.
i
now
repeat
it
more
correctly
thank
you
very
much
for
coming
to
my
little
party
.
obstinate
silence
.
they
all
feared
that
a
song
or
some
poetry
was
now
imminent
and
they
were
getting
bored
.
why
could
n't
he
stop
talking
and
let
them
drink
his
health
but
bilbo
did
not
sing
or
recite
.
he
paused
for
a
moment
.
thirdly
and
finally
he
said
i
wish
to
make
an
announcement
.
he
spoke
this
last
word
so
loudly
and
suddenly
that
everyone
sat
up
who
still
could
.
i
regret
to
announce
that
â
though
as
i
said
eleventy-one
years
is
far
too
short
a
time
to
spend
among
you
â
this
is
the
end
.
i
am
going
.
i
am
leaving
now
.
good-bye
he
stepped
down
and
vanished
.
there
was
a
blinding
flash
of
light
and
the
guests
all
blinked
.
when
they
opened
their
eyes
bilbo
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
.
one
hundred
and
forty-four
flabbergasted
hobbits
sat
back
speechless
.
old
odo
proudfoot
removed
his
feet
from
the
table
and
stamped
.
then
there
was
a
dead
silence
until
suddenly
after
several
deep
breaths
every
baggins
boffin
took
brandybuck
grubb
chubb
burrows
bolger
bracegirdle
brockhouse
goodbody
hornblower
and
proudfoot
began
to
talk
at
once
.
it
was
generally
agreed
that
the
joke
was
in
very
bad
taste
and
more
food
and
drink
were
needed
to
cure
the
guests
of
shock
and
annoyance
.
'he
's
mad
.
i
always
said
so
'
was
probably
the
most
popular
comment
.
even
the
tooks
with
a
few
exceptions
thought
bilbo
's
behaviour
was
absurd
.
for
the
moment
most
of
them
took
it
for
granted
that
his
disappearance
was
nothing
more
than
a
ridiculous
prank
.
but
old
rory
brandybuck
was
not
so
sure
.
neither
age
nor
an
enormous
dinner
had
clouded
his
wits
and
he
said
to
his
daughter-in-
law
esmeralda
'there
's
something
fishy
in
this
my
dear
i
believe
that
mad
baggins
is
off
again
.
silly
old
fool
.
but
why
worry
he
has
n't
taken
the
vittles
with
him
.
'
he
called
loudly
to
frodo
to
send
the
wine
round
again
.
frodo
was
the
only
one
present
who
had
said
nothing
.
for
some
time
he
had
sat
silent
beside
bilbo
's
empty
chair
and
ignored
all
remarks
and
questions
.
he
had
enjoyed
the
joke
of
course
even
though
he
had
been
in
the
know
.
he
had
difficulty
in
keeping
from
laughter
at
the
indignant
surprise
of
the
guests
.
but
at
the
same
time
he
felt
deeply
troubled
he
realized
suddenly
that
he
loved
the
old
hobbit
dearly
.
most
of
the
guests
went
on
eating
and
drinking
and
discussing
bilbo
baggins
'
oddities
past
and
present
but
the
sackville-bagginses
had
already
departed
in
wrath
.
frodo
did
not
want
to
have
any
more
to
do
with
the
party
.
he
gave
orders
for
more
wine
to
be
served
then
he
got
up
and
drained
his
own
glass
silently
to
the
health
of
bilbo
and
slipped
out
of
the
pavilion
.
as
for
bilbo
baggins
even
while
he
was
making
his
speech
he
had
been
fingering
the
golden
ring
in
his
pocket
his
magic
ring
that
he
had
kept
secret
for
so
many
years
.
as
he
stepped
down
he
slipped
it
on
his
finger
and
he
was
never
seen
by
any
hobbit
in
hobbiton
again
.
he
walked
briskly
back
to
his
hole
and
stood
for
a
moment
listening
with
a
smile
to
the
din
in
the
pavilion
and
to
the
sounds
of
merrymaking
in
other
parts
of
the
field
.
then
he
went
in
.
he
took
off
his
party
clothes
folded
up
and
wrapped
in
tissue-paper
his
embroidered
silk
waistcoat
and
put
it
away
.
then
he
put
on
quickly
some
old
untidy
garments
and
fastened
round
his
waist
a
worn
leather
belt
.
on
it
he
hung
a
short
sword
in
a
battered
black-leather
scabbard
.
from
a
locked
drawer
smelling
of
moth-balls
he
took
out
an
old
cloak
and
hood
.
they
had
been
locked
up
as
if
they
were
very
precious
but
they
were
so
patched
and
weatherstained
that
their
original
colour
could
hardly
be
guessed
it
might
have
been
dark
green
.
they
were
rather
too
large
for
him
.
he
then
went
into
his
study
and
from
a
large
strong-box
took
out
a
bundle
wrapped
in
old
cloths
and
a
leather-bound
manuscript
and
also
a
large
bulky
envelope
.
the
book
and
bundle
he
stuffed
into
the
top
of
a
heavy
bag
that
was
standing
there
already
nearly
full
.
into
the
envelope
he
slipped
his
golden
ring
and
its
fine
chain
and
then
sealed
it
and
addressed
it
to
frodo
.
at
first
he
put
it
on
the
mantelpiece
but
suddenly
he
removed
it
and
stuck
it
in
his
pocket
.
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
gandalf
came
quickly
in
.
'hullo
'
said
bilbo
.
'i
wondered
if
you
would
turn
up
.
'
'i
am
glad
to
find
you
visible
'
replied
the
wizard
sitting
down
in
a
chair
.
'i
wanted
to
catch
you
and
have
a
few
final
words
.
i
suppose
you
feel
that
everything
has
gone
off
splendidly
and
according
to
plan'
'yes
i
do
'
said
bilbo
.
'though
that
flash
was
surprising
it
quite
startled
me
let
alone
the
others
.
a
little
addition
of
your
own
i
suppose'
'it
was
.
you
have
wisely
kept
that
ring
secret
all
these
years
and
it
seemed
to
me
necessary
to
give
your
guests
something
else
that
would
seem
to
explain
your
sudden
vanishment
.
'
'and
would
spoil
my
joke
.
you
are
an
interfering
old
busybody
'
laughed
bilbo
'but
i
expect
you
know
best
as
usual
.
'
'i
do
â
when
i
know
anything
.
but
i
do
n't
feel
too
sure
about
this
whole
affair
.
it
has
now
come
to
the
final
point
.
you
have
had
your
joke
and
alarmed
or
offended
most
of
your
relations
and
given
the
whole
shire
something
to
talk
about
for
nine
days
or
ninety-nine
more
likely
.
are
you
going
any
further'
'yes
i
am
.
i
feel
i
need
a
holiday
a
very
long
holiday
as
i
have
told
you
before
.
probably
a
permanent
holiday
i
do
n't
expect
i
shall
return
.
in
fact
i
do
n't
mean
to
and
i
have
made
all
arrangements
.
'i
am
old
gandalf
.
i
do
n't
look
it
but
i
am
beginning
to
feel
it
in
my
heart
of
hearts
.
well-preserved
indeed
'
he
snorted
.
'why
i
feel
all
thin
sort
of
stretched
if
you
know
what
i
mean
like
butter
that
has
been
scraped
over
too
much
bread
.
that
ca
n't
be
right
.
i
need
a
change
or
something
.
'
gandalf
looked
curiously
and
closely
at
him
.
'no
it
does
not
seem
right
'
he
said
thoughtfully
.
'no
after
all
i
believe
your
plan
is
probably
the
best
.
'
'well
i
've
made
up
my
mind
anyway
.
i
want
to
see
mountains
again
gandalf
â
mountains
and
then
find
somewhere
where
i
can
rest
.
in
peace
and
quiet
without
a
lot
of
relatives
prying
around
and
a
string
of
confounded
visitors
hanging
on
the
bell
.
i
might
find
somewhere
where
i
can
finish
my
book
.
i
have
thought
of
a
nice
ending
for
it
and
he
lived
happily
ever
after
to
the
end
of
his
days
.
'
gandalf
laughed
.
'i
hope
he
will
.
but
nobody
will
read
the
book
however
it
ends
.
'
'oh
they
may
in
years
to
come
.
frodo
has
read
some
already
as
far
as
it
has
gone
.
you
'll
keep
an
eye
on
frodo
wo
n't
you'
'yes
i
will
â
two
eyes
as
often
as
i
can
spare
them
.
'
'he
would
come
with
me
of
course
if
i
asked
him
.
in
fact
he
offered
to
once
just
before
the
party
.
but
he
does
not
really
want
to
yet
.
i
want
to
see
the
wild
country
again
before
i
die
and
the
mountains
but
he
is
still
in
love
with
the
shire
with
woods
and
fields
and
little
rivers
.
he
ought
to
be
comfortable
here
.
i
am
leaving
everything
to
him
of
course
except
a
few
oddments
.
i
hope
he
will
be
happy
when
he
gets
used
to
being
on
his
own
.
it
's
time
he
was
his
own
master
now
.
'
'everything
'
said
gandalf
.
'the
ring
as
well
you
agreed
to
that
you
remember
.
'
'well
er
yes
i
suppose
so
'
stammered
bilbo
.
'where
is
it'
'in
an
envelope
if
you
must
know
'
said
bilbo
impatiently
.
'there
on
the
mantelpiece
.
well
no
here
it
is
in
my
pocket
'
he
hesitated
.
'is
n't
that
odd
now
'
he
said
softly
to
himself
.
'yet
after
all
why
not
why
should
n't
it
stay
there'
gandalf
looked
again
very
hard
at
bilbo
and
there
was
a
gleam
in
his
eyes
.
'i
think
bilbo
'
he
said
quietly
'i
should
leave
it
behind
.
do
n't
you
want
to'
'well
yes
â
and
no
.
now
it
comes
to
it
i
do
n't
like
parting
with
it
at
all
i
may
say
.
and
i
do
n't
really
see
why
i
should
.
why
do
you
want
me
to
'
he
asked
and
a
curious
change
came
over
his
voice
.
it
was
sharp
with
suspicion
and
annoyance
.
'you
are
always
badgering
me
about
my
ring
but
you
have
never
bothered
me
about
the
other
things
that
i
got
on
my
journey
.
'
'no
but
i
had
to
badger
you
'
said
gandalf
.
'i
wanted
the
truth
.
it
was
important
.
magic
rings
are
â
well
magical
and
they
are
rare
and
curious
.
i
was
professionally
interested
in
your
ring
you
may
say
and
i
still
am
.
i
should
like
to
know
where
it
is
if
you
go
wandering
again
.
also
i
think
you
have
had
it
quite
long
enough
.
you
wo
n't
need
it
any
more
bilbo
unless
i
am
quite
mistaken
.
'
bilbo
flushed
and
there
was
an
angry
light
in
his
eyes
.
his
kindly
face
grew
hard
.
'why
not
'
he
cried
.
'and
what
business
is
it
of
yours
anyway
to
know
what
i
do
with
my
own
things
it
is
my
own
.
i
found
it
.
it
came
to
me
.
'
'yes
yes
'
said
gandalf
.
'but
there
is
no
need
to
get
angry
.
'
'if
i
am
it
is
your
fault
'
said
bilbo
.
'it
is
mine
i
tell
you
.
my
own
.
my
precious
.
yes
my
precious
.
'
the
wizard
's
face
remained
grave
and
attentive
and
only
a
flicker
in
his
deep
eyes
showed
that
he
was
startled
and
indeed
alarmed
.
'it
has
been
called
that
before
'
he
said
'but
not
by
you
.
'
'but
i
say
it
now
.
and
why
not
even
if
gollum
said
the
same
once
.
it
's
not
his
now
but
mine
.
and
i
shall
keep
it
i
say
.
'
gandalf
stood
up
.
he
spoke
sternly
.
'you
will
be
a
fool
if
you
do
bilbo
'
he
said
.
'you
make
that
clearer
with
every
word
you
say
.
it
has
got
far
too
much
hold
on
you
.
let
it
go
and
then
you
can
go
yourself
and
be
free
.
'
'i
'll
do
as
i
choose
and
go
as
i
please
'
said
bilbo
obstinately
.
'now
now
my
dear
hobbit
'
said
gandalf
.
'all
your
long
life
we
have
been
friends
and
you
owe
me
something
.
come
do
as
you
promised
give
it
up'
'well
if
you
want
my
ring
yourself
say
so
'
cried
bilbo
.
'but
you
wo
n't
get
it
.
i
wo
n't
give
my
precious
away
i
tell
you
.
'
his
hand
strayed
to
the
hilt
of
his
small
sword
.
gandalf
's
eyes
flashed
.
'it
will
be
my
turn
to
get
angry
soon
'
he
said
.
'if
you
say
that
again
i
shall
.
then
you
will
see
gandalf
the
grey
uncloaked
.
'
he
took
a
step
towards
the
hobbit
and
he
seemed
to
grow
tall
and
menacing
his
shadow
filled
the
little
room
.
bilbo
backed
away
to
the
wall
breathing
hard
his
hand
clutching
at
his
pocket
.
they
stood
for
a
while
facing
one
another
and
the
air
of
the
room
tingled
.
gandalf
's
eyes
remained
bent
on
the
hobbit
.
slowly
his
hands
relaxed
and
he
began
to
tremble
.
'i
do
n't
know
what
has
come
over
you
gandalf
'
he
said
.
'you
have
never
been
like
this
before
.
what
is
it
all
about
it
is
mine
is
n't
it
i
found
it
and
gollum
would
have
killed
me
if
i
had
n't
kept
it
.
i
'm
not
a
thief
whatever
he
said
.
'
'i
have
never
called
you
one
'
gandalf
answered
.
'and
i
am
not
one
either
.
i
am
not
trying
to
rob
you
but
to
help
you
.
i
wish
you
would
trust
me
as
you
used
.
'
he
turned
away
and
the
shadow
passed
.
he
seemed
to
dwindle
again
to
an
old
grey
man
bent
and
troubled
.
bilbo
drew
his
hand
over
his
eyes
.
'i
am
sorry
'
he
said
.
'but
i
felt
so
queer
.
and
yet
it
would
be
a
relief
in
a
way
not
to
be
bothered
with
it
any
more
.
it
has
been
so
growing
on
my
mind
lately
.
sometimes
i
have
felt
it
was
like
an
eye
looking
at
me
.
and
i
am
always
wanting
to
put
it
on
and
disappear
do
n't
you
know
or
wondering
if
it
is
safe
and
pulling
it
out
to
make
sure
.
i
tried
locking
it
up
but
i
found
i
could
n't
rest
without
it
in
my
pocket
.
i
do
n't
know
why
.
and
i
do
n't
seem
able
to
make
up
my
mind
.
'
'then
trust
mine
'
said
gandalf
.
'it
is
quite
made
up
.
go
away
and
leave
it
behind
.
stop
possessing
it
.
give
it
to
frodo
and
i
will
look
after
him
.
'
bilbo
stood
for
a
moment
tense
and
undecided
.
presently
he
sighed
.
'all
right
'
he
said
with
an
effort
.
'i
will
.
'
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
smiled
rather
ruefully
.
'after
all
that
's
what
this
party
business
was
all
about
really
to
give
away
lots
of
birthday
presents
and
somehow
make
it
easier
to
give
it
away
at
the
same
time
.
it
has
n't
made
it
any
easier
in
the
end
but
it
would
be
a
pity
to
waste
all
my
preparations
.
it
would
quite
spoil
the
joke
.
'
'indeed
it
would
take
away
the
only
point
i
ever
saw
in
the
affair
'
said
gandalf
.
'very
well
'
said
bilbo
'it
goes
to
frodo
with
all
the
rest
.
'
he
drew
a
deep
breath
.
'and
now
i
really
must
be
starting
or
somebody
else
will
catch
me
.
i
have
said
good-bye
and
i
could
n't
bear
to
do
it
all
over
again
.
'
he
picked
up
his
bag
and
moved
to
the
door
.
'you
have
still
got
the
ring
in
your
pocket
'
said
the
wizard
.
'well
so
i
have
'
cried
bilbo
.
'and
my
will
and
all
the
other
documents
too
.
you
had
better
take
it
and
deliver
it
for
me
.
that
will
be
safest
.
'
'no
do
n't
give
the
ring
to
me
'
said
gandalf
.
'put
it
on
the
mantelpiece
.
it
will
be
safe
enough
there
till
frodo
comes
.
i
shall
wait
for
him
.
'
bilbo
took
out
the
envelope
but
just
as
he
was
about
to
set
it
by
the
clock
his
hand
jerked
back
and
the
packet
fell
on
the
floor
.
before
he
could
pick
it
up
the
wizard
stooped
and
seized
it
and
set
it
in
its
place
.
a
spasm
of
anger
passed
swiftly
over
the
hobbit
's
face
again
.
suddenly
it
gave
way
to
a
look
of
relief
and
a
laugh
.
'well
that
's
that
'
he
said
.
'now
i
'm
off'
they
went
out
into
the
hall
.
bilbo
chose
his
favourite
stick
from
the
stand
then
he
whistled
.
three
dwarves
came
out
of
different
rooms
where
they
had
been
busy
.
'is
everything
ready
'
asked
bilbo
.
'everything
packed
and
labelled'
'everything
'
they
answered
.
'well
let
's
start
then
'
he
stepped
out
of
the
front-door
.
it
was
a
fine
night
and
the
black
sky
was
dotted
with
stars
.
he
looked
up
sniffing
the
air
.
'what
fun
what
fun
to
be
off
again
off
on
the
road
with
dwarves
this
is
what
i
have
really
been
longing
for
for
years
good-bye
'
he
said
looking
at
his
old
home
and
bowing
to
the
door
.
'good-bye
gandalf'
'good-bye
for
the
present
bilbo
.
take
care
of
yourself
you
are
old
enough
and
perhaps
wise
enough
.
'
'take
care
i
do
n't
care
.
do
n't
you
worry
about
me
i
am
as
happy
now
as
i
have
ever
been
and
that
is
saying
a
great
deal
.
but
the
time
has
come
.
i
am
being
swept
off
my
feet
at
last
'
he
added
and
then
in
a
low
voice
as
if
to
himself
he
sang
softly
in
the
dark
the
road
goes
ever
on
and
on
down
from
the
door
where
it
began
.
now
far
ahead
the
road
has
gone
and
i
must
follow
if
i
can
pursuing
it
with
eager
feet
until
it
joins
some
larger
way
where
many
paths
and
errands
meet
.
and
whither
then
i
can
not
say
.
he
paused
silent
for
a
moment
.
then
without
another
word
he
turned
away
from
the
lights
and
voices
in
the
fields
and
tents
and
followed
by
his
three
companions
went
round
into
his
garden
and
trotted
down
the
long
sloping
path
.
he
jumped
over
a
low
place
in
the
hedge
at
the
bottom
and
took
to
the
meadows
passing
into
the
night
like
a
rustle
of
wind
in
the
grass
.
gandalf
remained
for
a
while
staring
after
him
into
the
darkness
.
'goodbye
my
dear
bilbo
â
until
our
next
meeting
'
he
said
softly
and
went
back
indoors
.
frodo
came
in
soon
afterwards
and
found
him
sitting
in
the
dark
deep
in
thought
.
'has
he
gone
'
he
asked
.
'yes
'
answered
gandalf
'he
has
gone
at
last
.
'
'i
wish
â
i
mean
i
hoped
until
this
evening
that
it
was
only
a
joke
'
said
frodo
.
'but
i
knew
in
my
heart
that
he
really
meant
to
go
.
he
always
used
to
joke
about
serious
things
.
i
wish
i
had
come
back
sooner
just
to
see
him
off
.
'
'i
think
really
he
preferred
slipping
off
quietly
in
the
end
'
said
gandalf
.
'do
n't
be
too
troubled
.
he
'll
be
all
right
â
now
.
he
left
a
packet
for
you
.
there
it
is'
frodo
took
the
envelope
from
the
mantelpiece
and
glanced
at
it
but
did
not
open
it
.
'you
'll
find
his
will
and
all
the
other
documents
in
there
i
think
'
said
the
wizard
.
'you
are
the
master
of
bag
end
now
.
and
also
i
fancy
you
'll
find
a
golden
ring
.
'
'the
ring
'
exclaimed
frodo
.
'has
he
left
me
that
i
wonder
why
.
still
it
may
be
useful
.
'
'it
may
and
it
may
not
'
said
gandalf
.
'i
should
not
make
use
of
it
if
i
were
you
.
but
keep
it
secret
and
keep
it
safe
now
i
am
going
to
bed
.
'
as
master
of
bag
end
frodo
felt
it
his
painful
duty
to
say
good-bye
to
the
guests
.
rumours
of
strange
events
had
by
now
spread
all
over
the
field
but
frodo
would
only
say
no
doubt
everything
will
be
cleared
up
in
the
morning
.
about
midnight
carriages
came
for
the
important
folk
.
one
by
one
they
rolled
away
filled
with
full
but
very
unsatisfied
hobbits
.
gardeners
came
by
arrangement
and
removed
in
wheel-barrows
those
that
had
inadvertently
remained
behind
.
night
slowly
passed
.
the
sun
rose
.
the
hobbits
rose
rather
later
.
morning
went
on
.
people
came
and
began
by
orders
to
clear
away
the
pavilions
and
the
tables
and
the
chairs
and
the
spoons
and
knives
and
bottles
and
plates
and
the
lanterns
and
the
flowering
shrubs
in
boxes
and
the
crumbs
and
cracker-paper
the
forgotten
bags
and
gloves
and
handkerchiefs
and
the
uneaten
food
a
very
small
item
.
then
a
number
of
other
people
came
without
orders
bagginses
and
boffins
and
bolgers
and
tooks
and
other
guests
that
lived
or
were
staying
near
.
by
mid-day
when
even
the
best-fed
were
out
and
about
again
there
was
a
large
crowd
at
bag
end
uninvited
but
not
unexpected
.
frodo
was
waiting
on
the
step
smiling
but
looking
rather
tired
and
worried
.
he
welcomed
all
the
callers
but
he
had
not
much
more
to
say
than
before
.
his
reply
to
all
inquiries
was
simply
this
'mr
.
bilbo
baggins
has
gone
away
as
far
as
i
know
for
good
.
'
some
of
the
visitors
he
invited
to
come
inside
as
bilbo
had
left
'messages
'
for
them
.
inside
in
the
hall
there
was
piled
a
large
assortment
of
packages
and
parcels
and
small
articles
of
furniture
.
on
every
item
there
was
a
label
tied
.
there
were
several
labels
of
this
sort
for
adelard
took
for
his
very
own
from
bilbo
on
an
umbrella
.
adelard
had
carried
off
many
unlabelled
ones
.
for
dora
baggins
in
memory
of
a
long
correspondence
with
love
from
bilbo
on
a
large
waste-paper
basket
.
dora
was
drogo
's
sister
and
the
eldest
surviving
female
relative
of
bilbo
and
frodo
she
was
ninety-nine
and
had
written
reams
of
good
advice
for
more
than
half
a
century
.
for
milo
burrows
hoping
it
will
be
useful
from
b.b
on
a
gold
pen
and
ink-bottle
.
milo
never
answered
letters
.
for
angelica
's
use
from
uncle
bilbo
on
a
round
convex
mirror
.
she
was
a
young
baggins
and
too
obviously
considered
her
face
shapely
.
for
the
collection
of
hugo
bracegirdle
from
a
contributor
on
an
empty
book-case
.
hugo
was
a
great
borrower
of
books
and
worse
than
usual
at
returning
them
.
for
lobelia
sackville-baggins
as
a
present
on
a
case
of
silver
spoons
.
bilbo
believed
that
she
had
acquired
a
good
many
of
his
spoons
while
he
was
away
on
his
former
journey
.
lobelia
knew
that
quite
well
.
when
she
arrived
later
in
the
day
she
took
the
point
at
once
but
she
also
took
the
spoons
.
this
is
only
a
small
selection
of
the
assembled
presents
.
bilbo
's
residence
had
got
rather
cluttered
up
with
things
in
the
course
of
his
long
life
.
it
was
a
tendency
of
hobbit-holes
to
get
cluttered
up
for
which
the
custom
of
giving
so
many
birthday-
presents
was
largely
responsible
.
not
of
course
that
the
birthday-
presents
were
always
new
there
were
one
or
two
old
mathoms
of
forgotten
uses
that
had
circulated
all
around
the
district
but
bilbo
had
usually
given
new
presents
and
kept
those
that
he
received
.
the
old
hole
was
now
being
cleared
a
little
.
every
one
of
the
various
parting
gifts
had
labels
written
out
personally
by
bilbo
and
several
had
some
point
or
some
joke
.
but
of
course
most
of
the
things
were
given
where
they
would
be
wanted
and
welcome
.
the
poorer
hobbits
and
especially
those
of
bagshot
row
did
very
well
.
old
gaffer
gamgee
got
two
sacks
of
potatoes
a
new
spade
a
woollen
waistcoat
and
a
bottle
of
ointment
for
creaking
joints
.
old
rory
brandybuck
in
return
for
much
hospitality
got
a
dozen
bottles
of
old
winyards
a
strong
red
wine
from
the
southfarthing
and
now
quite
mature
as
it
had
been
laid
down
by
bilbo
's
father
.
rory
quite
forgave
bilbo
and
voted
him
a
capital
fellow
after
the
first
bottle
.
there
was
plenty
of
everything
left
for
frodo
.
and
of
course
all
the
chief
treasures
as
well
as
the
books
pictures
and
more
than
enough
furniture
were
left
in
his
possession
.
there
was
however
no
sign
nor
mention
of
money
or
jewellery
not
a
penny-piece
or
a
glass
bead
was
given
away
.
frodo
had
a
very
trying
time
that
afternoon
.
a
false
rumour
that
the
whole
household
was
being
distributed
free
spread
like
wildfire
and
before
long
the
place
was
packed
with
people
who
had
no
business
there
but
could
not
be
kept
out
.
labels
got
torn
off
and
mixed
and
quarrels
broke
out
.
some
people
tried
to
do
swaps
and
deals
in
the
hall
and
others
tried
to
make
off
with
minor
items
not
addressed
to
them
or
with
anything
that
seemed
unwanted
or
unwatched
.
the
road
to
the
gate
was
blocked
with
barrows
and
handcarts
.
in
the
middle
of
the
commotion
the
sackville-bagginses
arrived
.
frodo
had
retired
for
a
while
and
left
his
friend
merry
brandybuck
to
keep
an
eye
on
things
.
when
otho
loudly
demanded
to
see
frodo
merry
bowed
politely
.
'he
is
indisposed
'
he
said
.
'he
is
resting
.
'
'hiding
you
mean
'
said
lobelia
.
'anyway
we
want
to
see
him
and
we
mean
to
see
him
.
just
go
and
tell
him
so'
merry
left
them
a
long
while
in
the
hall
and
they
had
time
to
discover
their
parting
gift
of
spoons
.
it
did
not
improve
their
tempers
.
eventually
they
were
shown
into
the
study
.
frodo
was
sitting
at
a
table
with
a
lot
of
papers
in
front
of
him
.
he
looked
indisposed
â
to
see
sackville-bagginses
at
any
rate
and
he
stood
up
fidgeting
with
something
in
his
pocket
.
but
he
spoke
quite
politely
.
the
sackville-bagginses
were
rather
offensive
.
they
began
by
offering
him
bad
bargain-prices
as
between
friends
for
various
valuable
and
unlabelled
things
.
when
frodo
replied
that
only
the
things
specially
directed
by
bilbo
were
being
given
away
they
said
the
whole
affair
was
very
fishy
.
'only
one
thing
is
clear
to
me
'
said
otho
'and
that
is
that
you
are
doing
exceedingly
well
out
of
it
.
i
insist
on
seeing
the
will
.
'
otho
would
have
been
bilbo
's
heir
but
for
the
adoption
of
frodo
.
he
read
the
will
carefully
and
snorted
.
it
was
unfortunately
very
clear
and
correct
according
to
the
legal
customs
of
hobbits
which
demand
among
other
things
seven
signatures
of
witnesses
in
red
ink
.
'foiled
again
'
he
said
to
his
wife
.
'and
after
waiting
sixty
years
.
spoons
fiddlesticks
'
he
snapped
his
fingers
under
frodo
's
nose
and
stumped
off
.
but
lobelia
was
not
so
easily
got
rid
of
.
a
little
later
frodo
came
out
of
the
study
to
see
how
things
were
going
on
and
found
her
still
about
the
place
investigating
nooks
and
corners
and
tapping
the
floors
.
he
escorted
her
firmly
off
the
premises
after
he
had
relieved
her
of
several
small
but
rather
valuable
articles
that
had
somehow
fallen
inside
her
umbrella
.
her
face
looked
as
if
she
was
in
the
throes
of
thinking
out
a
really
crushing
parting
remark
but
all
she
found
to
say
turning
round
on
the
step
was
'you
'll
live
to
regret
it
young
fellow
why
did
n't
you
go
too
you
do
n't
belong
here
you
're
no
baggins
â
you
â
you
're
a
brandybuck'
'did
you
hear
that
merry
that
was
an
insult
if
you
like
'
said
frodo
as
he
shut
the
door
on
her
.
'it
was
a
compliment
'
said
merry
brandybuck
'and
so
of
course
not
true
.
'
then
they
went
round
the
hole
and
evicted
three
young
hobbits
two
boffins
and
a
bolger
who
were
knocking
holes
in
the
walls
of
one
of
the
cellars
.
frodo
also
had
a
tussle
with
young
sancho
proudfoot
old
odo
proudfoot
's
grandson
who
had
begun
an
excavation
in
the
larger
pantry
where
he
thought
there
was
an
echo
.
the
legend
of
bilbo
's
gold
excited
both
curiosity
and
hope
for
legendary
gold
mysteriously
obtained
if
not
positively
ill-gotten
is
as
every
one
knows
any
one
's
for
the
finding
â
unless
the
search
is
interrupted
.
when
he
had
overcome
sancho
and
pushed
him
out
frodo
collapsed
on
a
chair
in
the
hall
.
'it
's
time
to
close
the
shop
merry
'
he
said
.
'lock
the
door
and
do
n't
open
it
to
anyone
today
not
even
if
they
bring
a
battering
ram
.
'
then
he
went
to
revive
himself
with
a
belated
cup
of
tea
.
he
had
hardly
sat
down
when
there
came
a
soft
knock
at
the
front-door
.
'lobelia
again
most
likely
'
he
thought
.
'she
must
have
thought
of
something
really
nasty
and
have
come
back
again
to
say
it
.
it
can
wait
.
'
he
went
on
with
his
tea
.
the
knock
was
repeated
much
louder
but
he
took
no
notice
.
suddenly
the
wizard
's
head
appeared
at
the
window
.
'if
you
do
n't
let
me
in
frodo
i
shall
blow
your
door
right
down
your
hole
and
out
through
the
hill
'
he
said
.
'my
dear
gandalf
half
a
minute
'
cried
frodo
running
out
of
the
room
to
the
door
.
'come
in
come
in
i
thought
it
was
lobelia
.
'
'then
i
forgive
you
.
but
i
saw
her
some
time
ago
driving
a
pony-trap
towards
bywater
with
a
face
that
would
have
curdled
new
milk
.
'
'she
had
already
nearly
curdled
me
.
honestly
i
nearly
tried
on
bilbo
's
ring
.
i
longed
to
disappear
.
'
'do
n't
do
that
'
said
gandalf
sitting
down
.
'do
be
careful
of
that
ring
frodo
in
fact
it
is
partly
about
that
that
i
have
come
to
say
a
last
word
.
'
'well
what
about
it'
'what
do
you
know
already'
'only
what
bilbo
told
me
.
i
have
heard
his
story
how
he
found
it
and
how
he
used
it
on
his
journey
i
mean
.
'
'which
story
i
wonder
'
said
gandalf
.
'oh
not
what
he
told
the
dwarves
and
put
in
his
book
'
said
frodo
.
'he
told
me
the
true
story
soon
after
i
came
to
live
here
.
he
said
you
had
pestered
him
till
he
told
you
so
i
had
better
know
too
.
``
no
secrets
between
us
frodo
''
he
said
``
but
they
are
not
to
go
any
further
.
it
's
mine
anyway
.
''
'
'that
's
interesting
'
said
gandalf
.
'well
what
did
you
think
of
it
all'
'if
you
mean
inventing
all
that
about
a
``
present
''
well
i
thought
the
true
story
much
more
likely
and
i
could
n't
see
the
point
of
altering
it
at
all
.
it
was
very
unlike
bilbo
to
do
so
anyway
and
i
thought
it
rather
odd
.
'
'so
did
i
.
but
odd
things
may
happen
to
people
that
have
such
treasures
â
if
they
use
them
.
let
it
be
a
warning
to
you
to
be
very
careful
with
it
.
it
may
have
other
powers
than
just
making
you
vanish
when
you
wish
to
.
'
'i
do
n't
understand
'
said
frodo
.
'neither
do
i
'
answered
the
wizard
.
'i
have
merely
begun
to
wonder
about
the
ring
especially
since
last
night
.
no
need
to
worry
.
but
if
you
take
my
advice
you
will
use
it
very
seldom
or
not
at
all
.
at
least
i
beg
you
not
to
use
it
in
any
way
that
will
cause
talk
or
rouse
suspicion
.
i
say
again
keep
it
safe
and
keep
it
secret'
'you
are
very
mysterious
what
are
you
afraid
of'
'i
am
not
certain
so
i
will
say
no
more
.
i
may
be
able
to
tell
you
something
when
i
come
back
.
i
am
going
off
at
once
so
this
is
good-bye
for
the
present
.
'
he
got
up
.
'at
once
'
cried
frodo
.
'why
i
thought
you
were
staying
on
for
at
least
a
week
.
i
was
looking
forward
to
your
help
.
'
'i
did
mean
to
â
but
i
have
had
to
change
my
mind
.
i
may
be
away
for
a
good
while
but
i
'll
come
and
see
you
again
as
soon
as
i
can
.
expect
me
when
you
see
me
i
shall
slip
in
quietly
.
i
sha
n't
often
be
visiting
the
shire
openly
again
.
i
find
that
i
have
become
rather
unpopular
.
they
say
i
am
a
nuisance
and
a
disturber
of
the
peace
.
some
people
are
actually
accusing
me
of
spiriting
bilbo
away
or
worse
.
if
you
want
to
know
there
is
supposed
to
be
a
plot
between
you
and
me
to
get
hold
of
his
wealth
.
'
'some
people
'
exclaimed
frodo
.
'you
mean
otho
and
lobelia
.
how
abominable
i
would
give
them
bag
end
and
everything
else
if
i
could
get
bilbo
back
and
go
off
tramping
in
the
country
with
him
.
i
love
the
shire
.
but
i
begin
to
wish
somehow
that
i
had
gone
too
.
i
wonder
if
i
shall
ever
see
him
again
.
'
'so
do
i
'
said
gandalf
.
'and
i
wonder
many
other
things
.
good-bye
now
take
care
of
yourself
look
out
for
me
especially
at
unlikely
times
good-bye'
frodo
saw
him
to
the
door
.
he
gave
a
final
wave
of
his
hand
and
walked
off
at
a
surprising
pace
but
frodo
thought
the
old
wizard
looked
unusually
bent
almost
as
if
he
was
carrying
a
great
weight
.
the
evening
was
closing
in
and
his
cloaked
figure
quickly
vanished
into
the
twilight
.
frodo
did
not
see
him
again
for
a
long
time
.

books
vs.
movies
i
recently
completed
a
course
at
a
community
college
in
california
where
we
reviewed
the
lord
of
the
rings
trilogy
the
hobbit
and
the
movies
all
four
movies
if
you
count
the
animated
hobbit
film
as
a
movie
which
i
do
only
begrudgingly
.
this
post
is
the
final
assignment
in
the
class
.
we
learned
a
bit
about
the
author
in
the
class
and
i
have
more
respect
for
tolkien
now
.
what
i
did
n't
know
before
was
that
tolkien
had
already
created
middle
earth
in
his
mind
unlike
many
modern
fantasy
writers
who
seem
to
just
throw
together
a
generic
map
and
give
it
some
crazy
name
.
in
tolkien
's
work
there
is
a
sense
that
the
world
is
much
older
than
the
stories
he
is
telling
it
is
less
so
with
other
writers
who
sometimes
create
two
or
more
worlds
which
seem
only
as
a
place
for
the
story
to
take
place
.
middle
earth
has
a
quality
that
makes
it
more
than
that
it
's
almost
a
character
rather
than
a
location
.
my
first
exposure
to
tolkien
was
in
anticipation
of
the
first
movie
in
2000
.
i
read
the
first
book
before
the
first
movie
came
out
then
completed
the
other
two
books
before
the
second
movie
came
out
.
i
also
read
the
hobbit
at
some
point
.
i
enjoyed
the
movies
enough
that
i
only
watched
them
a
couple
of
times
so
as
to
preserve
the
enchantment
.
i
was
a
young
teenager
when
i
first
read
the
books
and
i
was
too
young
to
appreciate
the
good
writing
.
at
the
time
i
preferred
the
movies
over
the
books
because
i
found
the
names
and
locations
to
be
difficult
to
distinguish
in
reading
but
easy
to
visualize
with
the
movies
.
having
taken
this
course
i
now
have
a
reversed
opinion
of
the
books
and
movies
.
i
believe
the
movies
are
as
good
as
can
be
done
but
the
literary
work
is
much
better
.
however
i
am
not
a
purist
when
it
comes
to
movies
vs.
books
.
reading
and
watching
lord
of
the
rings
in
conjunction
with
each
other
was
a
great
experience
because
it
gave
two
points
of
view
of
the
same
story
.
i
would
recommend
that
everyone
with
an
interest
in
the
series
compare
the
two
.
it
is
pretty
well
accepted
that
movie
renditions
are
never
as
good
as
the
book
they
are
based
on
and
out
of
necessity
there
are
things
altered
to
fit
budget
and
time
restraints
but
if
you
can
take
those
facts
as
read
there
are
some
interesting
comparisons
that
can
be
made
between
the
two
media
sources
.
for
example
the
character
faramir
is
completely
different
in
the
movie
.
some
people
are
content
to
say
that
the
movie
ruined
faramir
but
getting
past
the
differences
helps
to
get
a
new
view
of
the
character
.
i
used
this
practice
with
any
apparant
discrepancies
between
the
book
and
movies
.
after
ranting
about
how
they
messed
up
in
the
movie
i
took
an
objective
view
and
it
helped
me
to
value
both
works
higher
.

this
is
the
most
thrilling
piece
of
literature
known
to
the
english
language
.
i
first
read
the
lord
of
the
rings
when
i
was
nine
years
old
.
i
am
however
twelve
years
old
now
and
have
read
it
twice
every
year
since
.
this
is
by
far
the
most
compelling
book-nay
work
of
art-that
i
have
ever
been
able
to
come
upon
.
the
sheer
depth
and
rich
detail
alongside
the
intelectual
storyline
are
the
basic
characteristics
to
why
this
amazing
piece
of
literature
shall
remain
a
masterpiece
for
the
rest
of
the
existence
of
modern
english
.
thus
the
lessons
and
moral
values
that
can
be
deciphered
from
the
within
the
text
itself
can
also
be
considered
timeless

lord
of

is
the
best
book
ever

lord
of
the
rings
a
powerful
title
for
a
powerful
book
.
the
best
masterpiece
of
all
times
lord
of
the
rings
takes
you
to
a
different
world
where
anything
is
possible
.
lord
of
the
rings
takes
you
to
an
accurately
depicted
land
called
middle-earth
he
even
draws
a
map
for
you
.
here
any
imaginary
creature
imagined
can
be
located
metaphor
including
creatures
like
orcs
elves
dwarves
and
wizards
.
they
are
cleverly
described
in
there
own
unique
form
and
are
made
real
in
front
of
your
eyes
.
he
makes
you
hate
love
admire
and
pity
the
characters
to
such
extent
that
you
wo
n't
be
able
to
put
the
book
down
.
this
book
contains
everything
tragedy
love
treachery
action
adventure
etc
.
and
is
a
book
that
must
be
read
.
this
book
has
been
made
a
movie
and
may
be
discouraged
to
reading
it
but
this
would
be
a
great
mistake
.
the
movie
is
great
i
do
n't
deny
it
but
it
does
n't
explain
the
whole
book
.
the
book
is
in
the
top
ten
best
sellers
and
the
movies
also
.
j.r.r
.
tolkien
put
his
life
in
this
work
it
even
includes
songs
and
poems
i
have
never
seen
a
more
complete
work
in
my
life
nothing
is
missing
.
this
is
truly
a
masterpiece
full
of
characters
places
and
stories
.

excellent
quality
i
am
very
pleased
with
this
edition
and
would
heartily
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
a
single
volume
edition
of
the
lord
of
the
rings
.
starting
with
the
down
side
-
there
is
very
little
wrong
with
this
volume
.
i
just
finished
reading
the
novels
not
the
appendixes
and
found
only
two
typos
.
this
is
much
better
than
average
for
texts
scanned
from
a
paper
original
.
i
would
also
have
preferred
to
have
more
of
tolkien
's
original
illustrations
included
.
the
exterior
of
my
copy
had
rubber
cement
drips
from
the
glueing
of
the
fold
out
maps
.
they
came
off
but
were
a
little
disappointing
in
a
book
of
this
quality
.
on
the
positive
side
-
the
binding
of
the
volume
is
consistent
with
its
price
.
the
leather
is
soft
and
pleasant
to
the
touch
.
the
ribbon
page
marker
is
a
nice
convenience
for
such
a
large
volume
.
the
fold
out
maps
are
very
nice
and
a
big
plus
for
a
first
time
reader
trying
to
understand
middle
earth
.
the
high
gloss
photographs
depicting
the
book
of
mazarbul
are
a
nice
bonus
.
the
weight
and
substance
of
the
book
are
fitting
for
the
chapters
of
long
and
dreary
walking
.
the
leather
and
the
gilt
edges
lend
to
the
sense
of
majesty
and
consequence
captured
by
the
writing
.
a
fitting
tribute
to
the
text
itself
.

i
also
recommend
highest
recommendation
possible
if
you
are
reading
this
then
i
am
sure
this
is
n't
the
first
time
you
've
heard
about
the
lotr
``
trilogy
''
.
unless
you
've
been
living
under
a
rock
for
the
last
60
years
or
so
you
know
what
the
hype
is
all
about
.
i
have
about
4
different
printings
of
the
lotr
series
spanning
back
to
about
1964
and
this
ebook
version
is
my
favorite
one
to
read
.
many
of
the
annotated
places
and
people
have
a
link
sending
you
to
the
footnote
to
read
and
an
easy
back
button
so
you
do
n't
lose
your
page
.
the
elven
script
is
reproduced
flawlessly
.
the
only
thing
i
miss
are
the
maps
that
are
printed
in
the
paperback
versions
of
the
story
.

great
new
release
of
one
of
the
world
's
greatest
novels
of
all
time
this
hardcover
one-volume
edition
of
lord
of
the
rings
was
released
for
the
50th
anniversary
of
its
publication
1954
.
over
the
years
numerous
``
corrections
''
in
the
spelling
of
certain
words
by
well-intentioned
publishers
and
printers
led
to
some
confusion
among
readers
.
they
were
n't
really
serious
mistakes
but
some
readers
were
left
confused
by
the
lack
of
consistency
in
the
text
.
they
never
really
took
away
from
the
beauty
of
the
novel
but
tolkien
was
constantly
frustrated
by
these
constantly
reoccurring
errors
.
this
is
supposed
to
be
the
definitive
edition
with
all
mistakes
corrected
without
altering
anything
significant
in
the
text
or
really
changing
what
the
author
himself
wrote
.
it
's
printed
on
good
glossyish
paper
and
the
type
is
easy
to
read
.
i
've
carried
the
book
around
for
a
while
and
it
is
n't
falling
apart
at
the
seams
.
it
seems
to
be
bound
well
enough
to
last
a
while
.
the
only
shortcoming
that
this
edition
of
the
lord
of
the
rings
has
in
my
opinion
is
the
lack
of
fold-out
maps
that
appear
in
the
collectors
editions
and
the
three
volume
editions
of
the
novel
and
that
is
what
it
is
a
novel
and
not
a
trilogy
.
instead
it
shows
four
different
maps
as
if
the
original
map
of
middle
earth
were
divided
into
quarters
at
the
center
but
they
overlap
for
convenience
.
it
's
not
a
bad
thing
but
i
think
for
the
price
the
publisher
really
could
have
included
a
fold-out
map
or
two
.
but
that
's
the
only
drawback
whatsoever
and
his
original
map
of
the
shire
at
the
beginning
of
book
one
is
still
there
intact
.
as
for
the
novel
itself
what
a
great
epic
tale
.
i
really
only
wanted
this
review
to
explain
the
new
edition
and
what
makes
it
good
since
so
many
already
know
the
story
behind
the
lord
of
the
rings
.
the
movies
to
get
off
topic
for
a
moment
were
actually
pretty
faithful
to
the
book
in
many
respects
.
but
even
if
you
've
seen
the
movies
you
have
n't
seen
nothin
'
yet
until
you
have
read
the
book
which
is
quite
often
the
case
with
great
novels
that
get
made
into
movies
.
my
favorite
character
is
sam
frodo
's
faithful
companion
.
while
book
one
starts
out
a
bit
slow
it
picks
up
the
pace
considerably
in
book
two
and
really
gets
into
the
action
.
yes
it
's
long
but
it
's
as
just
about
as
long
as
it
needs
to
be
.
this
hardcover
edition
is
well
worth
the
price
and
more
convenient
to
read
than
a
three
volume
edition
where
you
'd
have
to
keep
flipping
from
one
volume
to
the
next
if
you
were
to
refer
to
the
index
or
appendices
that
follow
volume
three
.
i
recommend
getting
this
50th
anniversary
hardcover
edition
or
at
a
lesser
cost
the
paperback
version
of
it
.
i
do
not
regret
a
single
penny
i
paid
for
it
.

a

so
much
that
i

to
get
the
red
leather
edition
and
the
new
50th

black
editionthough
i
thought
it
was
blue
from
the
small

i
also
have
the
great
green

'there

back

'
the
hobbit
.
when
other
j.r.r
.
books
come
along
in
leather
i
'll
add
that
to
my
collection
...
which
i
hope
other
books
such
as
'the
silmarillion
'
will
be
shortly
.
i
suggest
reading
the
book
before
seeing
the
movie
or
do
somewhat
of
a
review
bookmovie
i.e
.
to
see
what
they
left
out
-
think
of
your
own
reasons
why
besides
the
movie
would
have
been
more
than
3
hours
long
per
'episode
'
and
odd
characters
.

tolkien
's
primary
work
a
masterpiece
about
three
or
four
years
ago
i
was
most
certainly
not
a
lover
of
fantasy
.
sure
i
had
a
vague
interest
in
``
narnia
''
but
for
the
most
part
it
was
n't
a
daily
part
of
my
life
...
.until
i
read
``
the
lord
of
the
rings
''
.
i
became
intrigued
when
i
saw
the
films
and
was
surprised
to
discover
they
were
originally
books
.
i
read
them
and
was
promptly
hooked
.
tolkien
has
such
a
unique
style
and
he
goes
into
enough
detail
that
it
draws
you
in
instead
of
boring
you
.
i
marvel
at
how
his
christian
faith
is
clearly
revealed
in
this
novel
even
thought
that
was
not
his
intent
in
the
least
.
it
goes
to
show
how
rooted
he
was
in
his
faith
in
god
.
his
plot
character
development
originality
and
creativity
concerning
the
extensive
geography
involved
in
this
book
is
phenomenal
.
i
loved
every
sentence
and
would
recommend
this
novel
to
anyone

the
lord
of
the
rings
put
together
as
tolkien
originally
meant
for
it
to
be
.
its
a
timeless
classic
in
the
epic
novels
.
i
highly
recommend
that
any
person
who
enjoyed
the
series
picks
this
book
up
.
its
priced
a
little
high
but
if
you
collect
the
books
at
all
it
is
well
worth
the
price
for
what
you
get
.

to
question.u
yes
it
does
contain
all
three
books
.
the
words
``
boxed
set
''
and
the
fact
that
the
title
doesnt
specify
any
book
in
the
series
and
instead
just
putting
the
name
of
the
series
itself
are
just
a
few
clues
to
look
for
to
make
sure
it
contains
all
three
.
this
however
only
contains
``
the
fellowship
of
the
ring
the
two
towers
and
the
return
of
the
king
''
.
it
does
not
contain
``
the
hobbit
''
.
so
if
you
were
expecting
it
to
include
that
well
too
bad
.
