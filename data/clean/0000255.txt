½
a
mind-blowing
fantastic
film
concerning
dreams
and
their
dimensions
and
how
one
man
dicaprio
assembles
a
team
together
in
order
to
plant
an
idea
in
an
important
businessman
's
mind
cillian
murphy
so
that
he
can
be
granted
his
wish
to
return
to
his
home
.
this
is
a
mostly
astonishing
picture
one
that
requires
its
audience
to
remain
on
the
edge
of
their
seats
throughout
its
entirety
.
with
so
many
thoughtless
hollow
summer
blockbusters
coming
out
nowadays
it
's
a
treat
to
finally
see
something
of
this
complexity
come
out
at
this
time
of
the
year
.
leo
as
always
turns
in
a
magnificent
performance
.
the
only
fault
this
film
has
is
its
lack
of
character
development
amongst
the
supporting
parts
which
i
originally
dismissed
but
now
that
i
think
of
it
-
what
do
we
know
about
joseph
gordon-levitt
in
the
film
despite
him
walking
all
over
walls
and
tom
hardy
's
smart-aleckness
although
it
's
easy
to
get
lost
in
this
adventure
director
nolan
does
n't
expect
you
to
understand
every
key
aspect
of
this
film
.
instead
just
accept
the
fact
that
this
is
a
complicated
movie
but
one
whose
story
is
handled
with
meticulous
care
.
without
question
a
very
good
film
and
one
that
is
deserving
of
the
massive
amount
of
attention
and
cash-flow
it
has
received

this

about

does

as

is
this
call

saito

absolve

her

is
