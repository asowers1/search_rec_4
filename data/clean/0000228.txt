get
ready
to
feel
old
.
twenty-four
years
have
passed
since
michael
crichton
published
his
bestselling
novel
jurassic
park
.
steven
spielbergs
1993
adaptation
of
crichtons
book
recently
celebrated
its
20th
anniversary
with
a
3d
re-release
.
and
the
last
time
you
were
able
to
see
a
jurassic
park
movie
in
theaters
before
that
was
2001
.
that
all
changes
right
now
.
universal
is
bringing
the
mighty
dinosaurs
of
the
jurassic
franchise
back
to
life
for
a
new
installment
in
the
ongoing
series
.
expect
a
lot
of
changes
on
screen
however
for
jurassic
world
.
very
few
original
players
from
the
initial
franchise
are
coming
back
as
far
as
we
know
.
the
pieces
are
starting
to
fall
into
place
on
the
fourth
movie
so
we
figured
we
would
dig
into
the
sequel
and
fill
you
in
on
all
of
the
latest
details
.
weve
done
this
in
the
past
for
wildly
anticipated
movies
like
batman
vs.
superman
star
wars
episode
vii
and
most
recently
marvels
guardians
of
the
galaxy
.
for
now
lets
extract
dna
from
the
frozen
specimens
of
jurassic
world
news
and
tell
you
what
we
know
so
far
.
release
date
as
far
back
as
2009
we
were
running
stories
about
a
fourth
jurassic
movie
even
as
the
sequel
toiled
away
in
development
hell
.
steven
spielberg
had
the
sequel
on
his
calendar
.
park
iii
director
joe
johnston
had
real
ideas
about
where
he
wanted
the
series
to
go
.
the
sequel
as
we
know
it
finally
got
fast-tracked
for
real
in
january
2013
when
the
studio
said
the
wheels
were
turning
toward
a
release
.
we
entertained
a
2014
date
but
universally
officially
circled
june
12
2015
and
that
date
so
far
has
stuck
.
the
director
spielberg
never
planned
to
come
back
.
when
johnston
passed
on
the
opportunity
to
once
again
helm
a
dinosaur
thriller
universal
started
fishing
for
worthy
replacements
.
they
landed
on
colin
trevorrow
a
relative
newcomer
who
made
a
name
for
himself
to
a
certain
extent
with
the
shaggy-dog
time
travel
romance
safety
not
guaranteed
with
aubrey
plaza
jake
johnson
and
mark
duplass
.
i
say
``
to
a
certain
extent
''
because
while
safety
charmed
the
film-festival
circuit
it
didnt
necessarily
turn
trevorrow
into
a
household
name
.
jurassic
world
still
needed
star
power
.
chris
pratt
jurassic
park
had
sam
neill
who
returned
for
part
three
.
the
lost
world
had
jeff
goldblum
.
trevorrow
needed
a
rugged
leading
man
for
jurassic
world
.
he
finally
settled
on
the
busiest
man
in
show
business
at
the
moment
parks
and
rec
co-star
chris
pratt
.
the
charismatic
young
actor
is
coming
off
turns
in
the
massively
successful
the
lego
movie
where
he
voiced
the
main
character
emmet
.
oh
yeah
then
pratt
was
the
star
and
star-lord
of
marvels
guardians
of
the
galaxy
which
happened
to
be
the
highest-grossing
film
of
2014
.
pratts
basically
on
fire
right
now
and
his
role
in
jurassic
world
can
only
heat
his
white-hot
career
even
further
.
