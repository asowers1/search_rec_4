shocking

it
's
probably
healthy
to
crack
open
the
glass
remove
a
certain

masterpiece
from
the

and
in
re-reading
it
recall
thatunlike

is
a
disgusting
book
.
furthermore
the
day
will
never
come
when
it
is
not
a
disgusting

by
comparison
in
fact
it
can
make
lawrence
and
joyce
look
like
a

of

for
all
its
arduous
recourse
to
the
c-word
lady
chatterley
's
lover
places
its
faith
in
the
sexually
fulfilled
marriage

ho-hum
piety
in
the
age
of
divorce

for
all
its
scatological
frankness
ulysses
tells
the
touching
story
of
a
surrogate
father
finding
his
surrogate

lolita

tells
the
story
of

critic

he
is
working
on

about
the
1980s
.
``

humbert
asks
us
early
on
by
way
of
setting
up
his
description
of
his
first
taste
of
sexual
bliss
with
lolita
the
pre-pubescent
daughter
of
his
landlady

humbert
will
eventually
marry

landlady

humbert
will
eventually
abscond
with

.
for
now
though
he
is
only

boarder

debonair
european
with
certain
hidden
proclivities
.
``
so
let
us
get
started
.
i
have
a
difficult
job
before
me
.
''
this
is
nabokov
winking
out
at
us
.
by
difficult
job
humbert
means
i
want
to
conjure
this
scene
up
with
all
its
strange
anatomical
circumnavigations
as
carefully
as
possible
to
demonstrate
to
the
reader
that
i
am
not
wholly
a
monster
.
he
also
means
i
had
to
ejaculate
without
letting

know

by
difficult
job
nabokov
means
i
will
indulge
humbert
in
all
his
strange
circumlocutions
to
demonstrate
to
the
reader
what
a
total
monster
he
is
.
in
this
respect
nabokov
and
humbert
have
opposing
aims
but
in
the
telling
they
become
as
one
.
all
the
comically
baroque
pleonasms
help
humbert
shield
from
himself
how
repulsively
he
has
acted
.
they
allow
nabokov
meanwhile
to
describe
a
rapine
act
of
frottage
without
becoming
explicitly
pornographic
.
here
is
some
of
what
follows
she
was
musical
and
apple-sweet
.
her
legs
twitched
a
little
as
they
lay
across

live

stroked
them
there
she
lolled
on
in
the

corner

her
immemorial
fruit

through

juice

her

the

of
her
slipperless
foot
in
its
sloppy
anklet
against
the
pile
of
old
magazines
heaped
on
my
left
on
the
sofaâand
every
movement
she
made
every
shuffle
and
ripple
helped
me
to
conceal
and
improve
the
secret
system
of
tactile
correspondence
between
beast
and
beautyâbetween
my
gagged
bursting
beast
and
the
beauty
of
her
dimpled
body
in
its
innocent
cotton
frock

and
a
little
later
with
the
deep
hot
sweetness
thus
established
and
well
on
its
way
to
its
ultimate
convulsion
i
felt
i
could
slow
down
in

to
prolong
the
glow

â
then
finally
her
teeth
rested
on
her
glistening
underlip
as
she
half-turned
away
and

moaning

against

or
monster
had
ever
known
.
lolita
turns
50
this
year
and
having
stayed
so
perverse
it
remains
fresh
as
ever
.
to
fully
appreciate
its
perversity
though
one
must
first
appreciate
that
it
is
not
obscene
.
your
run-of-the-mill
obscene
masterworkâtropic
of
cancer
sayâdemands
that
you
enlightened
reader
work
your
way
past
the
sex
and
excrement
to
recognize
how
beautiful
it
is
.
but
with
lolita
you
must
work
past
its
beauty
to
recognize
how
shocking
it
is
.
and
for
all
its
beauty
for
all
its
immense
ingenuity
and
humor
one
easily
forgets
how
shocking
lolita
is
.
to
wit
later
in
the
narrative
humbert
has
settled
with
lolita
in
a
small
town
called
beardsley
and
set
up
a
semblance
of
a
normal
suburban
life
.
humbert
is
called
into
lolita
's
private
school
for
a
parent-teacher
conference
where
he
is
told
that
she
is
``
antagonistic
dissatisfied
cagey
''
and
``
obsessed
with
sexual
thoughts
for
which
she
finds
no
outlet
.
''
in
essence
humbert
is
being
offered
an
inventory
of
the
damage
he
has
wrought
on
his
stepdaughter
but
all
he
can
do
is
sneer
inwardly
at
the
messenger
a
psychobabbling
crone
named
pratt
and
then
â
and
then
â
well
what
happens
next
is
so
shocking
and
yet
so
calmly
and
economically
detailed
it
had
somehow
absented
itself
from
my
memory
of
the
novel
.
humbert
finds
lolita
sitting
in
a
study
hall
with
a
sepia
print
of
reynolds
'
'the
age
of
innocence
'
above
the
chalkboard
and
several
rows
of
clumsy-looking
pupil
desks
.
at
one
of
these
my
lolita
was
reading
â
and
there
was
another
girl
with
a
very
naked
porcelain-white
neck
and
wonderful
platinum
hair
who
sat
in
front
reading
too
absolutely
lost
to
the
world
and
interminably
winding
a
soft
curl
around
one
finger
and
i
sat
beside
dolly
lolita
just
behind
that
neck
and
that
hair
and
unbuttoned
my
overcoat
and
for
sixty-five
cents
plus
the
permission
to
participate
in
the
school
play
had
dolly
put
her
inky
chalky
red-knuckled
hand
under
the
desk
.
oh
stupid
and
reckless
of
me
no
doubt
but
after
the
torture
i
had
been
subjected
to
i
simply
had
to
take
advantage
of
a
combination
that
i
knew
would
never
occur
again
.
accustomed
to
receiving
lolita
as
evidence
of
towering
genius
we
hide
a
question
in
plain
sight
why
did
nabokov
choose
to
inhabit
humbert
humbert
a
pitiable
half-mad
ãmigrã
suffering
from
acute
nympholepsy
in
the
first
place
one
clue
is
hidden
in
the
last
part
of
that
last
sentence
i
simply
had
to
take
advantage
of
a
combination
that
i
knew
would
never
occur
again
.
humbert
means
look
i
had
to
avail
myself
of
that
hand-job
because
when
might
the
opportunity
ever
recur
but
nabokov
again
winking
at
us
means
i
love
the
exquisite
particularity
of
that
specific
instant
.
the
only
psychiatrist
nabokov
could
tolerate
was
havelock
ellis
for
whom
``
the
individuality
of
each
case
is
respected
and
catalogued
in
the
same
way
that
butterflies
are
carefully
classified
''
as
one
of
nabokov
's
biographers
has
explained
.
nabokov
was
a
famous
lepidopterist
.
conversely
nabokov
detested
``
freudian
voodooism
''
as
he
once
put
it
because
he
saw
in
freud
an
attempt
by
psychiatry
to
corner
appropriate
and
submit
to
generalized
principles
people
's
inner
lives
.
and
submitting
one
's
inner
lifeâthe
unique
hazard
of
one
's
personality
the
camera
obscura
of
one
's
own
personal
store
of
memoriesâto
a
set
of
deterministic
explanations
was
for
nabokov
an
indignity
on
par
with
the
expropriations
of
the
bolsheviks
.

to
inhabit
a
pedophileâand
not
just
a
pedophile
but
a
european
pedophile
on
an
american
soil
nabokov
had
himself
grown
to
loveâwas
to
torture
in
extremis
his
faith
in
the
sanctity
of
the
exquisite
inner
life
.
we
are
clearly
meant
to
regard
humbert
as
a
moral
abomination
and
even
humbert
eventually
concedes
it
is
one
of
the
book
's
most
beautiful
and
unforgettable
passages
that
in
exploiting
lolita
he
has
gratuitously
destroyed
another
human
being
.
and
yet
how
close
to
absolute
nabokov
makes
humbert
's
claim
to
his
own
thoughts
and
feelings
there
are
two
competing
accounts
in
lolita
for
why
humbert
is
a
pervert
.
the
first
is
a
bit
of
personal
mythopoeics
put
forward
by
humbert
himself
who
believes
his
entirely
natural
love
for
a
young
girl
named
annabel
when
he
was
a
young
boy
and
its
brutally
abrupt
interruption
explains
the
origin
of
his
adult
nympholepsy
.
later
humbert
tells
us
of
having
once
bribed
a
nurse
to
show
him
his
psychiatric
files
in
which
he
discovered
he
has
been
labeled
``
homosexual
.
''
the
first
explanation
is
poetic
beautiful
intensely
rendered
utterly
self-serving
and
probably
untrue
.
the
second
explanation
is
clinical
dispassionate
probably
true
but
so
neglectful
of
the
intensity
of
humbert
's
own
consciousness
as
to
be
repulsive
to
nabokov
.
nabokov
overcame
the
worst
affliction
of
all
from
a
writer
's
point
of
view
a
happy
childhood
.
he
was
an
eldest
child
who
chose
to
pretend
he
was
an
only
child
.
testimony
from
acquaintances
relates
how
loath
he
was
even
to
casually
discuss
siblings
and
one
can
read
dozens
of
pages
of
speak
memory
without
ever
sensing
he
had
to
share
his
parents
'
affections
.
``
there
was
a
sunny
quality
about
the
way
he
talked
of
his
own
family
''
one
of
his
wellesley
students
has
recalled
``
one
had
the
feeling
of
the
much-loved
little
princeling
.
clean
linen
and
hot
milk
and
never
a
scolding
.
''
that
utter
primacy
of
the
little
princeling
basking
in
the
eyes
of
his
justly
revering
parents
seems
never
to
have
left
nabokov
but
as
a
genius
he
understood
it
both
as
his
burden
and
as
his
unique
portal
to
aesthetic
discovery
.
lolita
is
most
commonly
remembered
as
one
man
's
living
poem
to
his
own
daemonic
perversity
and
as
such
is
overpraised
by
its
adherents
for
its
technical
virtuosity
and
hilarity
and
misconstrued
by
its
detractors
as
little
more
than
a
frost-encrusted
monument
to
nabokov
's
own
monumental
arrogance
.
its
real
genius
is
too
easily
missed
.
it
lies
in
what
nabokov
called
the
``
nerves
of
the
novel
''
the
``
secret
points
the
subliminal
coordinates
by
means
of
which
the
book
is
plotted
.
''
in
these
nabokov
has
hinted
at
the
life
that
exceeds
the
perimeter
of
humbert
's
encompassing
obsessionâat
the
inner
lives
of
those
others
whom
he
so
casually
dismisses
or
destroys
.
it
cost
nabokov
by
his
own
admission
``
a
month
of
work
''
to
write
one
sentence
in
which
humbert
gets
his
hair
cut
by
a
barber
who
has
never
stopped
mourning
his
dead
sonâa
fact
that
scarcely
dents
humbert
's
exquisite
consciousness
.
