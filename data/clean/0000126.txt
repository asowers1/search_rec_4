new

published

by
sandy

james
camerons
vision
for
the
future
of
the
avatar
franchise
was
originally
two
sequels
and
maybe
a
prequel
down
the
line
but
that
expanded
to
encompass
an
entireâ
new
movie
trilogy
over
this
past
year
.
the
plan
is
for
shooting
including
but
not
restricted
to
motion-capture
photography
to
get
underway
by
october
2014
two
months
before
cameron
originally
expectedâ
avatar
2â
to
reach
theaters
approximately
one
year
after
the
first
installment
obliterated
global
box
office
records
for
perspective
.
the
filmmaker
adjusted
his
projected
release
date
for
avatar
2â
from
2014
to
2015
over
a
year
ago
before
the
trilogy
was
announced
.
back
then
he
was
preparing
to
film
at
least
part
of
the
sequel
in
wellington
production
studios
in
new
zealand
where
peter
jackson
has
been
shooting
the
hobbit
trilogy
over
the
last
couple
of
years
not
so
long
after
cameron
had
purchased
a
sizable
portion
of
undeveloped
real
estate
read
farmland
in
the
country
.
camerons
lightstorm
entertainment
along
with
20th
century
fox
studio
and
the
new
zealand
government
has
officially
confirmed
that
the
entire
new
avatar
movie
trilogy
will
be
produced
in
the
country
in
a
deal
that
is
reportedly
worth
more
than
nz500
million
412
million
and
will
ensure
that
around
90
percent
of
the
live-action
production
crew
on
the
trilogy
is
composed
of
new
zealanders
.
hiring
will
take
place
over
the
forthcoming
months
as
cameron
is
currently
overseeing
the
script
writing
for
avatar
2
3
and
4
from
hisâ
2500
acres
of
farmland
around
lake
pounui
which
is
a
20-minute
helicopter
ride
from
the
nz
capital
of
wellington
.
for
a
more
thorough
breakdown
of
the
deal
read
the
article
over
at
thr
.
odds
are
that
cameron
will
end
up
being
credited
as
the
co-screenwriter
on
all
three
avatar
sequels
with
his
scripting
collaborators
includingâ
josh
friedman
the
sarah
connor
chronicles
on
avatar
2
rick
jaffa
and
amanda
silver
dawn
of
the
planet
of
the
apes
on
avatar
3
and
shane
salerno
savages
on
avatar
4
.
in
an
ap
interview
cameron
promised
that
the
avatar
sequels
will
chart
new
territories
and
native
inhabitants
of
pandora
but
revealed
that
the
films
wont
be
heading
off-planet
as
he
originally
thought
would
be
required
its
going
to
be
a
lot
of
new
imagery
and
a
lot
of
new
environments
and
creatures
across
pandora
.
were
blowing
it
out
all
over
the
place
.
at
first
i
thought
i
was
going
to
take
it
onto
other
worlds
as
well
in
the
same
solar
system
but
it
turned
out
not
to
be
necessary
.
i
mean
the
pandora
that
we
have
imagined
will
be
a
fantasy
land
that
is
going
to
occupy
people
for
decades
to
come
the
way
i
see
it
.
of
course
most
would
agree
that
its
the
stories
that
are
the
wild
card
factor
here
not
so
much
the
expanded
worldview
of
pandora
in
these
films
something
thatâ
cameron
is
all
too
aware
of.â
indeed
in
said
ap
interview
he
also
indicated
the
scope
of
the
narrative
in
the
new
avatar
trilogy
will
far
outstrip
that
in
the
original
film
the
first
'avatar
'
was
very
jake-centric
.
his
story
seen
through
his
eyes
.
we
spread
it
around
quite
a
bit
more
as
we
go
forward
.
its
really
the
story
of
his
family
the
family
that
he
creates
on
pandora
.
his
extended
family
.
so
think
of
it
as
a
family
saga
like
the
godfather
.
plot
details
on
the
new
avatar
trilogy
are
tightly
under
lock
and
key
right
now
but
we
anticipate
some
variation
on
the
settlers
vs.
natives
in
space
narrative
of
the
first
movie
not
least
of
all
because
stephen
lang
will
reprise
as
colonel
quaritch
through
means
that
have
yet
to
be
explained
and
cameron
has
said
that
the
memorable
if
two-dimensional
military
antagonist
from
avatar
will
evolve
into
really
unexpected
places
in
the
sequels
.

just

in

that
james

has
gone

way
of

george
lucas
and
really
doesnt
care
as
much
about
having
a
strong
script
as
he
does
in
having
great
special
effects
.
i
long
said
that
if
the

had
been

the

would
be

the
script
was
never
the
point
of
avatar
though
in
the
same
manner
the
script
in
gravity
its
weakest
aspect
was
never
the
point
.
it
was
the
event
the
presentation
of
something
we
had
never
seen
before
.
its
remarkable
success
at
the
box
office
was
born
out
of
repeat
viewings
of
something
never
seen
before
.
technology
has
caught
up
with
camerons
imagination
.
what
now
lacks
in
script
finesse
presents
itself
in
crowd
pleasing
rhetoric
.
of
course
we
have
seen
it
before
now
.
the
broadstrokes
will
still
be
present
in
the
sequels
but
it
would
be
fair
to
expect
a
little
more
script
attention

i
agree
that
the
point
of
avatar
was
not
the
script
but
i
strongly
strongly
disagree
with
the
comparison
of
cameron
to
george
lucas
.
cameron
in
my
observation
has
typically
held
to
extremely
high
standards
of
visual
storytelling
truly
taking
the
time
to
use
technology
to
further
the
story
even
if
the
script
is
simplistic
.
i
think
that
lucas
on
the
other
hand
just
kind
of
went
off
the
rails
totally
more
interested
in
playing
around
with
new
technology
as
novelty
than
using
it
to
serve
the
story
to
say
nothing
of
the
scripts
.

i
agree
.
i
mean
the
it
was
reported
that
he
wanted
to
do
a
sequel
for
a
while
to
avatar
but
that
the
technology
for
underwater
motion
capture
wasnt
fully
ready
yet
.
for
the
guy
to
wait
this
long
to
make
sure
the
technology
is
at
his
standards
says
that
he
has
very
high
standards
in
visuals
.
i
consider
cameron
more
like
del
toro
.
their
storytelling
at
times
are
basic
or
hit
and
miss
but
when
it
comes
to
the
visual
aspect
of
the
movie
its
right
at
the
top
.
lucas
was
great
in
the
beginning
but
then
lost
his
mojo
as
the
years
went
on
and
also
decreased
in
his
standardswhich
is
why
i
am
glad
that
star
wars
has
gone
away
from
the
lucas
brand

gaining

mass

told

that
those
15

were

people
bought
the

.
avatar
didnt
have
any
big
movies
that
could
overthrow
it
and
cameron
kept
it
longer
in
the
cinemas
.
then
even
people
that
couldnt
give
a

about
this
after
seeing
trailer
went
in
the
cinema
as
well
i
didnt
like
the

but
i
know
one

that
saw

1

5

saying
it
was
the
best

i
agree
with

how
can
you
watch

more

once
i
simply
dont

it
didnt

in
one
go
it
had
2
showings
unlike
other
movies
.
and
first
time
in
cinemas
was
longer
than
other
movies
.
and
yes
advertisement
and
lack
of
competitors
means
alot
.
even
i
went
to
see
but
didnt
like
it
alots
of
us
it
can
be
applied
to
any
product
.
just
because
someone
grabbed
alot
of
money
doesnt
the
product
is
good
and
they
will
have
some
more
money
next
time
.
cameron
is
a
salesman
he
needed
to
sale
his
cameras
and
so
he
needed
viewers
to
buy
his
movie
and
talk
about
this
new
3d
like
its
something
that
youve
never
saw
before
.
most
of
the
people
didnt
see
any
kind
of
3d
and
so
they
thought
it
was
a
good
showingeven
if
the
movie
itself
was
average
.
so
then
they
went
to
see
it
second
time
.
marketing
is
psycology
if
it
wouldnt
work
alot
of
people
would
be
jobless
and
you
would
have
more
choice
at
the
store
for
example
.
but
marketing
makes
your
choice
of
products
more
controlled
especially
on
something
you
cant
tasteexperience
before
you
pay
.
but
after
you
made
a
choice
you
either
test
other
products
in
class
or
say
something
like
nah
the
price
is
almost
the
same
it
tastesworks
good
and
firm
name
is
known
to
me
so
i
will
buy
it
again
.
sure
its
a
more
non
detail
example
but
you
get
the
picture

the
thing
is
that
people
went
to
see
the
movie
multiple
times
when
it
first
came
out
as
it
was
advertised
that
it
was
a
big
screen
experience
unlike
any
before
seen
.
i
remember
news
stations
doing
stories
about
how
people
have
gone
2-3
times
to
see
the
movie
to
experience
pandora
.
i
seem
to
also
remember
another
story
of
which
people
were
having
depression
which
was
later
called
âanti-avatar
depressionâ
.
say
what
you
will
about
the
scriptplot
because
i
agree
that
it
was
very
average
at
best
but
as
far
as
the
visuals
there
is
no
argument
that
it
was
the
first
of
its
kind
and
very
little
movies
that
has
since
come
out
has
been
able
to
meet
or
exceed
those
type
of
visual
arts
.
with
these
sequel
movies
itâs
being
reported
that
cameron
plans
on
introducing
some
kind
of
improved
technology
for
under
water
motion
capture
and
if
it
turns
out
to
be
something
that
produces
even
close
to
the
avatar
experiencewhich
some
are
saying
itâs
supposed
to
be
more
advanced
then
i
can
see
this
sequel
producing
another
3
billion
type
of
moneyfor
the
sequel
alone
.

so
to
go
on
some
of
the
success
of
the
first
avatar
can
be
because
of
the
advertisment
but
a
lot
of
it
was
based
on
word
of
mouth
.
the
word
of
mouth
from
people
saying
its
an
experience
unlike
anything
ive
never
seen
before
was
pretty
powerful
.
also
yes
there
wasnt
a
lot
of
competition
but
that
again
falls
into
knowing
when
to
screen
a
product
.
thats
why
i
think
a
lot
of
these
2015
movies
will
make
money
but
not
as
much
as
they
thought
it
would
because
of
the
competition
that
is
suppose
to
come
out
as
well

hope
this

rather
than
follows
certain
characters
trekking
along
it
weve
got
two
middle
earth
trilogies
for
that

i
think
itd
be
quite
unique

interesting
to
explore

through
the
means
of

in

is
explored

if
nothing
else
camerons
movies
on
the
whole
have
been
groundbreaking
and
extremley
successful
.
but
theres
still
no
way
he
can
even
be
close
to
the
same
regard
as
the
likes
of
spielberg
scorsese
de
palma
coppola
etc
.
those
directors
have
achieved
great
movies
crossing
over
a
multitude
of
different
genres
.
camerons
forte
is
deeply
sci-fi
rooted
and
its
hard
to
imagine
him
ever
trying
anything
else
.
i
would
even
argue
that
nolan
is
superior
just
in
terms
on
variation
alone
.
he
faces
a
different
type
of
challenge
with
the
avatar
sequels
though
.
the
lure
of
3d
has
well
and
truly
boomed
and
busted
.
the
first
films
success
was
down
to
novelty
and
the
unknown
.
this
time
a
better
story
will
be
required
to
convince
moviegoers
.
the
sequels
will
be
massive
of
course
just
not
as
big
as
the
original
.
people
have
noted
the
long
gap
between
films
but
of
course
that
didnt
hurt
t2s
success
.

but
then
again
t2
also
was
a
pioneer
in
technology
.
the
cgi
effects
for
the
t-1000
were
way
beyond
anything
that
weve
seen
up
to
that
point

thats
the
thing
.
say
what
you
want
about
cameron
but
the
guy
knows
how
to
bring
in
new
technology
.
if
the
reports
are
true
about
the
sequel
introducing
new
under
water
motion
capture
tech
then
that
will
be
pretty
interesting
.

i
m
not
sure
if
doing
differant
genres
makes
some
better.i
like
all
their
films
but
equally
cameron.who
made
titanic
which
won
11
oscars.he
also
made
piranha
2lets
not
talk
about
that
.
i
would
also
add
ridley
scott
to
my
list
.
if
the
hobbit
films
keep
grossing
billions
3d
is
going
no
where.i
dont
care
for
itbut
cameron
did
it
right
.
i
also
think
the
next
avatar
films
will
be
more
succesfulcameron
is
a
great
salesman
and
also
hypes
his
films
really
well.remember
avatar
day.its
a
shame
his
not
doing
a
prequel
on
first
contact
with
pandora

there
still
will
probably
a
prequel
movie
.
the
4th
movie
made
will
most
likely
be
the
prequel
as
said
here

yathats
been
changed
to
three
sequels
with
the
first
involving
pandoras
oceans.this
time
as
well
other
people
are
writing
the
scripts
from
his
stories
so
we
may
see
a
lift
story
wisehaving
said
that
cameron
has
wrote
some
classics.shame
about
the
prequeli
would
have
preferred
that
to
a
sequel
.

with
the
long
delay
anyway
i
hope
the
later
start
means
hell
shoot
in
60fps
as
opposed
to
48
so
we
can
see
what
thats
like
also

hmmm
..

no..
after
terminator
2
this
dude
started
to
change
.
it
really
does
sound
like
this
dude
will
end
his
career
on
avatars..
why
because
after
becoming
a
box
office
champ
all
he
is
chasing
is
just
that..
numbers..
i
will
always
go
see
his
movies..
and
i
have
unlimited
amount
of
respect
for
what
he
does
and
the
way
he
puts
1000
..
but
i
can
not
hide
my
disappointment
in
him
not
doing
aliens
sequel
one
of
superhero
movies..
something
new
something
thought
provoking..
without
having
to
worry
about
meeting
expectation
from
widest
audiences
possiblealways
having
to
deliever
some
messages
i
just
wish
he
was
free
from
all
these
expectation
from
every
possible
angles
so
that
he
can
make
a
movie..
just
wish

imho
avatar
was
okay
as
in
great
visually
and
acceptably
mediocre
plot-wise
.
but
the
whole
âone
with
natureâ
thing
was
annoyingly
cheesy
especially
at
the
end
.
and
the
whole
âevil
unmerciful
military-industrial
complexâ
theme
was
embarrassingly
trite
.

i
donât
know
.
jake
got
a
happy
pat
ending
in
avatar
.
so
right
now
it
feels
to
me
like
mr.
cameron
is
forcing
pandoraâs
plotline
back
open
.
i
can
see
it
now
â
colonel
quaritch
is
resurrected
as
an
evil
navi
who
leads
his
own
navi
faction
and
still
fights
to
conquer
pandora
for
earth
.
but
the
rdaâs
security
force
somehow
betrays
him
what
a
twist
so
â
you
know
the
rest
.

could
be
but
whatever
the
storyline
is
its
going
to
involve
something
involving
some
overwater
people
so
im
interested
to
see
where
this
all
goes
.
truthfully
i
hope
it
works
out
because
if
the
underwater
concept
works
then
i
see
no
excuse
as
to
why
dcwb
shouldnt
make
an
aquaman

i
personally
think
the
movie
was
quiet
spectacular
and
will
to
this
day
still
watch
it
on
dvd
and
enjoy
it
.
i
cant
wait
for
the
sequels
to
come
out
.
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
movies
i
have
ever
seen
.
