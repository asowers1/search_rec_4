if
you
really
want
to
hear
about
it
the
first
thing
you
'll
probably
want
to
know
is
where
i
was
born
and
what
my
lousy
childhood
was
like
and
how
my
parents
were
occupied
and
all
before
they
had
me
and
all
that
david
copperfield
kind
of
crap
but
i
do
n't
feel
like
going
into
it
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
.
in
the
first
place
that
stuff
bores
me
and
in
the
second
place
my
parents
would
have
about
two
hemorrhages
apiece
if
i
told
anything
pretty
personal
about
them
.
they
're
quite
touchy
about
anything
like
that
especially
my
father
.
they
're
nice
and
allã³i
'm
not
saying
thatâbut
they
're
also
touchy
as
hell
.
besides
i
'm
not
going
to
tell
you
my
whole
goddam
autobiography
or
anything
.
i
'll
just
tell
you
about
this
madman
stuff
that
happened
to
me
around
last
christmas
just
before
i
got
pretty
run-down
and
had
to
come
out
here
and
take
it
easy
.
i
mean
that
's
all
i
told
d.b
.
about
and
he
's
my
brother
and
all
.
he
's
in
hollywood
.
that
is
n't
too
far
from
this
crumby
place
and
he
comes
over
and
visits
me
practically
every
week
end
.
he
's
going
to
drive
me
home
when
i
go
home
next
month
maybe
.
he
just
got
a
jaguar
.
one
of
those
lithe
english
jobs
that
can
do
around
two
hundred
miles
an
hour
.
it
cost
him
damn
near
four
thousand
bucks
.
he
's
got
a
lot
of
dough
now
.
he
did
n't
use
to
.
he
used
to
be
just
a
regular
writer
when
he
was
home
.
he
wrote
this
terrific
book
of
short
stories
the
secret
goldfish
in
case
you
never
heard
of
him
.
the
best
one
in
it
was
``
the
secret
goldfish
.
''
it
was
about
this
little
kid
that
would
n't
let
anybody
look
at
his
goldfish
because
he
'd
bought
it
with
his
own
money
.
it
killed
me
.
now
he
's
out
in
hollywood
d.b
.
being
a
prostitute
.
if
there
's
one
thing
i
hate
it
's
the
movies
.
do
n't
even
mention
them
to
me
.
where
i
want
to
start
telling
is
the
day
i
left
pencey
prep
.
pencey
prep
is
this
school
that
's
in
agerstown
pennsylvania
.
you
probably
heard
of
it
.
you
've
probably
seen
the
ads
anyway
.
they
advertise
in
about
a
thousand
magazines
always
showing
some
hot-shot
guy
on
a
horse
jumping
over
a
fence
.
like
as
if
all
you
ever
did
at
pencey
was
play
polo
all
the
time
.
i
never
even
once
saw
a
horse
anywhere
near
the
place
.
and
underneath
the
guy
on
the
horse
's
picture
it
always
says
``
since
1888
we
have
been
molding
boys
into
splendid
clear-thinking
young
men
.
''
strictly
for
the
birds
.
they
do
n't
do
any
damn
more
molding
at
pencey
than
they
do
at
any
other
school
.
and
i
did
n't
know
anybody
there
that
was
splendid
and
clear-thinking
and
all
.
maybe
two
guys
.
if
that
many
.
and
they
probably
came
to
pencey
that
way
.
anyway
it
was
the
saturday
of
the
football
game
with
saxon
hall
.
the
game
with
saxon
hall
was
supposed
to
be
a
very
big
deal
around
pencey
.
it
was
the
last
game
of
the
year
and
you
were
supposed
to
commit
suicide
or
something
if
old
pencey
did
n't
win
.
i
remember
around
three
o'clock
that
afternoon
i
was
standing
way
the
hell
up
on
top
of
thomsen
hill
right
next
to
this
crazy
cannon
that
was
in
the
revolutionary
war
and
all
.
you
could
see
the
whole
field
from
there
and
you
could
see
the
two
teams
bashing
each
other
all
over
the
place
.
you
could
n't
see
the
grandstand
too
hot
but
you
could
hear
them
all
yelling
deep
and
terrific
on
the
pencey
side
because
practically
the
whole
school
except
me
was
there
and
scrawny
and
faggy
on
the
saxon
hall
side
because
the
visiting
team
hardly
ever
brought
many
people
with
them
.
there
were
never
many
girls
at
all
at
the
football
games
.
only
seniors
were
allowed
to
bring
girls
with
them
.
it
was
a
terrible
school
no
matter
how
you
looked
at
it
.
i
like
to
be
somewhere
at
least
where
you
can
see
a
few
girls
around
once
in
a
while
even
if
they
're
only
scratching
their
arms
or
blowing
their
noses
or
even
just
giggling
or
something
.
old
selma
thurmerâshe
was
the
headmaster
's
daughterâshowed
up
at
the
games
quite
often
but
she
was
n't
exactly
the
type
that
drove
you
mad
with
desire
.
she
was
a
pretty
nice
girl
though
.
i
sat
next
to
her
once
in
the
bus
from
agerstown
and
we
sort
of
struck
up
a
conversation
.
i
liked
her
.
she
had
a
big
nose
and
her
nails
were
all
bitten
down
and
bleedy-looking
and
she
had
on
those
damn
falsies
that
point
all
over
the
place
but
you
felt
sort
of
sorry
for
her
.
what
i
liked
about
her
she
did
n't
give
you
a
lot
of
horse
manure
about
what
a
great
guy
her
father
was
.
she
probably
knew
what
a
phony
slob
he
was
.
the
reason
i
was
standing
way
up
on
thomsen
hill
instead
of
down
at
the
game
was
because
i
'd
just
got
back
from
new
york
with
the
fencing
team
.
i
was
the
goddam
manager
of
the
fencing
team
.
very
big
deal
.
we
'd
gone
in
to
new
york
that
morning
for
this
fencing
meet
with
mcburney
school
.
only
we
did
n't
have
the
meet
.
i
left
all
the
foils
and
equipment
and
stuff
on
the
goddam
subway
.
it
was
n't
all
my
fault
.
i
had
to
keep
getting
up
to
look
at
this
map
so
we
'd
know
where
to
get
off
.
so
we
got
back
to
pencey
around
two-thirty
instead
of
around
dinnertime
.
the
whole
team
ostracized
me
the
whole
way
back
on
the
train
.
it
was
pretty
funny
in
a
way
.
the
other
reason
i
was
n't
down
at
the
game
was
because
i
was
on
my
way
to
say
good-by
to
old
spencer
my
history
teacher
.
he
had
the
grippe
and
i
figured
i
probably
would
n't
see
him
again
till
christmas
vacation
started
.
he
wrote
me
this
note
saying
he
wanted
to
see
me
before
i
went
home
.
he
knew
i
was
n't
coming
back
to
pencey
.
i
forgot
to
tell
you
about
that
.
they
kicked
me
out
.
i
was
n't
supposed
to
come
back
after
christmas
vacation
on
account
of
i
was
flunking
four
subjects
and
not
applying
myself
and
all
.
they
gave
me
frequent
warning
to
start
applying
myselfâespecially
around
mid-terms
when
my
parents
came
up
for
a
conference
with
old
thurmerâbut
i
did
n't
do
it
.
so
i
got
the
ax
.
they
give
guys
the
ax
quite
frequently
at
pencey
.
it
has
a
very
good
academic
rating
pencey
.
it
really
does
.
anyway
it
was
december
and
all
and
it
was
cold
as
a
witch
's
teat
especially
on
top
of
that
stupid
hill
.
i
only
had
on
my
reversible
and
no
gloves
or
anything
.
the
week
before
that
somebody
'd
stolen
my
camel's-hair
coat
right
out
of
my
room
with
my
fur-lined
gloves
right
in
the
pocket
and
all
.
pencey
was
full
of
crooks
.
quite
a
few
guys
came
from
these
very
wealthy
families
but
it
was
full
of
crooks
anyway
.
the
more
expensive
a
school
is
the
more
crooks
it
hasâi
'm
not
kidding
.
anyway
i
kept
standing
next
to
that
crazy
cannon
looking
down
at
the
game
and
freezing
my
ass
off
.
only
i
was
n't
watching
the
game
too
much
.
what
i
was
really
hanging
around
for
i
was
trying
to
feel
some
kind
of
a
good-by
.
i
mean
i
've
left
schools
and
places
i
did
n't
even
know
i
was
lean7ing
them
.
i
hate
that
.
i
do
n't
care
if
it
's
a
sad
good-by
or
a
bad
good-by
but
when
i
leave
a
place
i
like
to
know
i
'm
leaving
it
.
if
you
do
n't
you
feel
even
worse
.
i
was
lucky
.
all
of
a
sudden
i
thought
of
something
that
helped
make
me
know
i
was
getting
the
hell
out
.
i
suddenly
remembered
this
time
in
around
october
that
i
and
robert
tichener
and
paul
campbell
were
chucking
a
football
around
in
front
of
the
academic
building
.
they
were
nice
guys
especially
tichener
.
it
was
just
before
dinner
and
it
was
getting
pretty
dark
out
but
we
kept
chucking
the
ball
around
anyway
.
it
kept
getting
darker
and
darker
and
we
could
hardly
see
the
ball
any
more
but
we
did
n't
want
to
stop
doing
what
we
were
doing
.
finally
we
had
to
.
this
teacher
that
taught
biology
mr.
zambesis
stuck
his
head
out
of
this
window
in
the
academic
building
and
told
us
to
go
back
to
the
dorm
and
get
ready
for
dinner
.
if
i
get
a
chance
to
remember
that
kind
of
stuff
i
can
get
a
good-by
when
i
need
oneâat
least
most
of
the
time
i
can
.
as
soon
as
i
got
it
i
turned
around
and
started
running
down
the
other
side
of
the
hill
toward
old
spencer
's
house
.
he
did
n't
live
on
the
campus
.
he
lived
on
anthony
wayne
avenue
.
i
ran
all
the
way
to
the
main
gate
and
then
i
waited
a
second
till
i
got
my
breath
.
i
have
no
wind
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
.
i
'm
quite
a
heavy
smoker
for
one
thingâthat
is
i
used
to
be
.
they
made
me
cut
it
out
.
another
thing
i
grew
six
and
a
half
inches
last
year
.
that
's
also
how
i
practically
got
t.b
.
and
came
out
here
for
all
these
goddam
checkups
and
stuff
.
i
'm
pretty
healthy
though
.
anyway
as
soon
as
i
got
my
breath
back
i
ran
across
route
204
.
it
was
icy
as
hell
and
i
damn
near
fell
down
.
i
do
n't
even
know
what
i
was
running
forâi
guess
i
just
felt
like
it
.
after
i
got
across
the
road
i
felt
like
i
was
sort
of
disappearing
.
it
was
that
kind
of
a
crazy
afternoon
terrifically
cold
and
no
sun
out
or
anything
and
you
felt
like
you
were
disappearing
every
time
you
crossed
a
road
.
boy
i
rang
that
doorbell
fast
when
i
got
to
old
spencer
's
house
.
i
was
really
frozen
.
my
ears
were
hurting
and
i
could
hardly
move
my
fingers
at
all
.
``
c'mon
c'mon
''
i
said
right
out
loud
almost
``
somebody
open
the
door
.
''
finally
old
mrs.
spencer
opened
it
.
they
did
n't
have
a
maid
or
anything
and
they
always
opened
the
door
themselves
.
they
did
n't
have
too
much
dough
.
``
holden
''
mrs.
spencer
said
.
``
how
lovely
to
see
you
come
in
dear
are
you
frozen
to
death
''
i
think
she
was
glad
to
see
me
.
she
liked
me
.
at
least
i
think
she
did
.
boy
did
i
get
in
that
house
fast
.
``
how
are
you
mrs.
spencer
''
i
said
.
``
how
's
mr.
spencer
''
''
let
me
take
your
coat
dear
''
she
said
.
she
did
n't
hear
me
ask
her
how
mr.
spencer
was
.
she
was
sort
of
deaf
.
she
hung
up
my
coat
in
the
hall
closet
and
i
sort
of
brushed
my
hair
back
with
my
hand
.
i
wear
a
crew
cut
quite
frequently
and
i
never
have
to
comb
it
much
.
``
how
'd
you
been
mrs.
spencer
''
i
said
again
only
louder
so
she
'd
hear
me
.
``
i
've
been
just
fine
holden
.
''
she
closed
the
closet
door
.
``
how
have
you
been
''
the
way
she
asked
me
i
knew
right
away
old
spencer
'd
told
her
i
'd
been
kicked
out
.
``
fine
''
i
said
.
``
how
's
mr.
spencer
he
over
his
grippe
yet
''
''
over
it
holden
he
's
behaving
like
a
perfectâi
do
n't

the
catcher
in
the
rye-a
book
for
the
young
old
readers
and
nonreaders
j.d
.
salinger
's
coming
of
age
novel
the
catcher
in
the
rye
has
delightfully
captured
the
attention
of
readers
for
decades
.
its
popularity
is
primarily
but
not
exclusively
due
to
the
realism
behind
the
plot
characters
and
themes
.
although
the
story
takes
place
during
the
late
1940s
teenagers
everywhere
can
still
relate
to
the
sixteen
year
old
protagonist
holden
caulfield
.
the
combination
of
his
criticism
bitterness
and
pessimism
towards
society
was
carefully
crafted
to
create
holden
as
a
unique
narrator
with
many
conflicting
thoughts
.
in
fact
holden
feels
so
torn
between
becoming
an
adult
and
staying
a
child
that
he
essentially
alienates
himself
from
those
who
have
conformed
to
one
or
the
other
.
the
distress
and
confusion
of
growing
up
is
the
underlying
theme
that
follows
holden
throughout
the
entire
novel
.
from
just
the
first
chapter
of
the
novel
readers
come
to
learn
that
holden
is
not
your
typical
adolescent
boy
.
he
does
not
hold
back
when
criticizing
his
``
phony
''
schoolmates
whose
obsessions
include
girls
sex
smoking
and
drinking
.
although
holden
feels
compelled
to
engage
in
the
latter
two
activities
himself
he
does
not
necessarily
agree
with
it
.
he
is
merely
trying
to
find
a
medium
between
childhood
and
adulthood
.
feeling
alone
and
isolated
holden
carries
out
the
extreme
by
leaving
his
prep
school
to
escape
those
around
him
already
engrossed
in
maturing
into
adults
.
the
story
follows
with
a
number
of
events
that
all
contribute
to
holden
's
intriguing
journey
to
understanding
himself
a
journey
many
young
people
in
the
world
today
go
on
themselves
.
because
salinger
's
themes
are
so
universal
yet
realistic
the
catcher
in
the
rye
is
found
to
be
satisfying
and
relatable
to
all
types
of
readers
.
holden
and
his
struggles
bring
each
reader
back
to
a
time
in
their
own
lives
when
they
were
going
through
a
drastic
change
.
for
that
reason
the
catcher
in
the
rye
can
easily
be
considered
timeless
.
the
thought
of
keeping
this
novel
off
libraries
'
shelves
because
of
its
vulgar
language
sexual
references
and
so-called
promotion
of
drug
use
is
ludicrous
.
do
not
let
the
accusations
and
believers
of
censorship
keep
you
from
becoming
immersed
into
the
world
of
holden
caulfield
.

i
read
this
book
this
year
for

i
was
in
a
bad
mood
and
i
ended
up
reading
half
of
it
in
one
night
.
its
a
book
that
's
so
easy
to
understand
its
so
human
.
there
's
no
action
or
any
thrill
much
at
all
besides
the
everyday
life
of
holden
caulfield
.
i
recommend
this
book
to
anyone
who
's
human

''
the
catcher
in
the
rye
''
more
than
timeless
the
novel
``
the
catcher
in
the
rye
''
by
j.d
.
salinger
was
written
in
1951
.
however
it
is
still
being
read
in
schools
today
.
unlike
many
timeless
novels
``
the
catcher
in
the
rye
''
not
only
provides
a
strong
message
that
still
resonates
today
it
also
is
a
fascinating
creative
piece
of
writing
.
``
the
catcher
in
the
rye
''
takes
place
in
the
1940s
and
tells
the
story
of
holden
caulfield
a
troubled
teenager
haunted
by
the
death
of
his
little
brother
.
the
story
follows
holden
as
he
runs
away
from
private
school
while
hoping
to
find
to
find
happiness
somewhere
in
the
streets
of
new
york
.
holden
is
both
the
protagonist
and
antagonist
of
his
story
.
he
is
stubborn
rude
and
judgmental
without
a
cause
.
on
the
other
hand
holden
loves
his
little
sister
and
wants
to
protect
children
from
the
world
around
them
.
he
is
broken
and
in
search
of
something
he
ca
n't
seem
to
find
.
he
is
searching
for
love
.
when
his
brother
died
holden
lost
someone
who
loved
him
.
even
though
holden
could
n't
see
the
love
depart
he
feels
it
slipping
away
.
holden
's
parents
are
too
caught
up
in
their
own
pain
to
recognize
that
holden
is
struggling
.
holden
is
forced
to
bear
all
of
his
burdens
by
himself
.
it
is
this
struggle
that
makes
the
novel
timeless
.
in
essence
we
are
all
holden
a
little
lost
and
a
little
broken
but
always
pushing
forward
looking
for
a
glimmer
of
happiness
in
the
distance
.
everyone
knows
the
feeling
of
being
in
a
place
where
everyone
else
belongs
.
anyone
can
relate
to
holden
's
struggle
to
find
himself
in
a
place
where
people
look
down
on
those
who
differ
from
the
status
quo
.
``
the
catcher
in
the
rye
''
makes
the
experience
both
poignant
and
humorous
.
holden
is
a
teenage
boy
whose
thoughts
are
often
ludicrous
and
socially
incorrect
.
j.d
.
salinger
knew
that
there
was
more
to
writing
a
novel
then
just
getting
the
message
across
.
he
accomplishes
it
with
comedy
and
intrigue
.
it
is
hard
not
to
laugh
when
holden
is
lying
to
a
women
about
his
age
while
calling
those
around
him
phonies
.
``
the
catcher
in
the
rye
''
is
a
classic
because
it
would
remain
a
talented
piece
of
writing
even
without
a
moral
``
point
''
.
the
novel
merges
timeless
and
engaging
with
an
effortlessness
that
many
authors
ca
n't
achieve
.

an
awesome
classic
i
only
read
catcher
in
the
rye
for
my
english
class
but
it
turned
out
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
books
i
had
n't
really
read
too
many
classics
before
and
had
heard
a
lot
of
negative
feedback
about
them
but
this
was
a
great
surprise
it
was
funny
and
packed
with
wit
and
full
of
self
discovery
.
there
was
a
ton
of
swearing
but
somehow
it
really
fit
with
the
characters
.
i
loved
it

this
book
is
terrible
am
i
the
only
one
who
thinks
so
the
writing
style
is
cumbersome
the
characters
-
especially
holden
-
are
wholly
unlikable
and
the
story
...
well
what
story
nothing
happens
i
ca
n't
believe
i
've
felt
all
these
years
that
i
was
missing
out
on
a
work
of
literary
genius
only
to
finally
find
myself
suffering
through
this
.
i
rank
this
as
the
second
worst
book
i
've
ever
read
-
and
i
've
read
many
.

a
good
book
for
late
teens
i
read
this
many
years
ago
when
i
was
a
teenager
and
then
again
just
recently
.
it
once
again
reminded
me
of
all
of
the
freedom
a
young
man
has
compared
to
an
adult
and
the
book
brought
me
back
to
when
i
was
young
.
this
is
a
must-read
for
all
teens
since
it
will
give
them
a
sort
of
guide
as
to
what
to
do
and
not
to
do
but
it
will
also
entertain
them
if
they
are
a
cosciencious
reader
.

disappointing
i
'd
always
wanted
to
read
this
book
because
i
'd
always
heard
it
was
a
very
excellent
story
full
of
excitement
about
a
teenager
going
through
the
phases
of
growing
up
.
unfortunately
the
entire
book
is
about
him
romping
around
new
york
for
3
days
on
his
own
not
doing
anything
out
the
ordinary
seeing
a
movie
visiting
old
friends
etc
.
i
was
very
disappointed
.

one
of
the
worst
books
i
have
ever
read
...
no
plot
-
no
real
interest
-
forced
myself
to
finish
this
book
.
tried
again
as
an
adult
with
hopes
of
seeing
something
i
missed
the
first
go
round
-
nope
still
one
of
the
worst
books
i
have
ever
had
the
misfortune
of
reading
twice
.
with
all
the
wonderful
books
out
there
why
is
this
book
still
on
the
literature
lists
in
high
schools
and
colleges
.

no

so
many

have
this

in

lee
harvey
oswald
and
other
disturbed
individuals
have
this

in

.
i
do

amazing
.
absolutely
amazing
.
catcher
in
the
rye
is
a
wonderful
novel
by
j.d
.
salinger
.
i
love
how
holden
the
main
character
narrates
the
happenings
of
several
of
days
in
his
teenage
life
.
so
although
this
book
is
only
a
few
days
time
it
did
not
lack
in
content
at
all
.
i
liked
this
book
because
when
holden
talks
it
feels
like
he
is
speaking
only
to
you
.
j.d
.
salinger
is
an
amazing
writer
and
made
me
laugh
throughout
the
book
.
he
gave
holden
a
very
unique
and
interesting
personality
.
holden
goes
through
seemingly
pointless
events
though
he
hopes
somebody
will
care
.
holden
feels
hopeless
and
lonesome
in
a
world
that
he
thinks
is
heartless
and
filled
with
fake
people
.
it
really
makes
you
think
about
the
world
as
you
see
it
.
holden
's
beliefs
and
judgments
alone
were
very
amusing
.
after
you
read
the
book
you
start
thinking
about
situations
in
your
life
and
wonder
what
holden
would
do
in
your
place
or
at
least
i
did
.
throughout
this
book
holden
gives
his
opinions
and
observations
on
everything
he
encounters
.
i
did
n't
ever
want
to
stop
reading
.
there
are
not
many
books
i
'd
ever
read
again
but
this
book
is
one
that
i
could
read
over
and
over
again
.
there
are
so
many
things
that
did
n't
make
total
sense
to
me
but
im
sure
that
if
i
read
it
again
it
will
become
more
clear
.
loved
it
read
it
.
so
i
loved
every
bit
.
i
do
n't
think
i
will
ever
forget
it
great
book
from
the
start
to
finish
.
read
it
if
you
start
reading
and
it
does
n't
seem
to
be
your
kind
of
book
keep
reading
you
may
surprise
yourself
.

more
from
this
reviewer
i
also
recommend
definitely
worth
my
time
i
knew
that
``
the
catcher
in
the
rye
''
was
an
older
book
because
my
dad
had
talked
about
how
it
was
such
a
classic
even
to
my
grandpaw
.
i
decided
to
buy
it
and
i
finished
it
the
day
it
was
purchased
.
i
usually
do
n't
read
that
quickly
but
it
was
very
good
.
not
a
lot
actually
happens
within
the
time
it
was
narrated
by
holden
but
the
best
part
of
the
book
is
how
the
author
is
descriptive
about
things
that
deserve
to
be
described
and
leaves
out
the
less
important
things
which
many
other
authors
fail
to
do
making
their
books
drag
on
.
one
of
the
few
books
i
'll
remember
for
a
long
long
time
.

simply
overrated
and
-
i
hate
to
say
it
-
'phony'
i
will
not
lie
i
am
a
literature
geeknerdwhatever
.
i
love
great
writing
.
if
that
sounds
like
you
then
do
not
pick
up
catcher
in
the
rye
.
it
does
not
come
close
to
a
masterpiece
of
literature
.
on
the
other
hand
if
angst
poor
prose
and
even
poorer
ideasthemes
are
your
thing
pick
up
catcher
and
you
might
even
love
it
.
hell
you
might
start
to
live
by
it
and
think
that
everyone
around
is
so
fake
that
you
want
to
shoot
them
up
.
sorry
j.d
.
but
if
throwing
in
curse
words
into
a
novel
and
writing
about
a
teenager
are
great
literary
innovations
then
i
am
sorry
to
say
literature
is
going
downhill
and
it
really
just
might
be
.
if
you
have
been
told
this
is
a
classic
and
that
is
your
reason
for
reading
it
you
probably
should
n't
pick
it
up
.
read
some
real
classics
.

i
'm
not
alone
i
'm
38
years
old
and
an
avid
reader
but
believe
it
or
not
i
've
never
read
catcher
in
the
rye
until
now
.
i
have
to
say
it
's
very
difficult
to
keep
reading
because
as
other
reviewers
point
out
there
's
no
plot
i
'm
eager
to
read
some
literary
analysis
of
this
book
because
i
want
to
know
what
i
'm
missing
if
anything
.
i
ca
n't
imagine
being
assigned
to
read
this
book
in
high
school
...
.i
do
n't
know
what
would
have
kept
me
hooked
enough
to
continue
.
i
guess
i
'm
just
stubborn
because
i
intend
to
finish
it
but
ca
n't
see
it
getting
any
better

no
high
school
relevancy
in
my
reading
of
the
book
i
've
realised
that
j.d
.
salinger
's
book
the
catcher
in
the
rye
is
nothing
more
than
a
moot
account
of
three
days
from
holden
caulfield
'the
main
chactrer
's
'
tales
of
drunken
debauchery
and
excessive
tobacco
use
.
the
book
also
contains
very
little
symbolism
which
would
prove
useful
from
a
teachers
standpoint
.
holden
as
a
person
is
also
very
negative
and
due
to
the
fact
that
the
story
is
told
in
first
peron
the
views
in
the
book
are
highly
limited
.
also
the
examples
of
tone
and
diction
throughout
this
book
are
very
limited
as
well
for
the
same
reasons
listed
above
.
j.d
.
salinger
provides
a
fun
read
but
not
a
literary
example
for
the
high
school
english
class
.

serious

was
in

institution
when

this

was

this

a
great
classic
''
the
catcher
in
the
rye
''
has
rigid
reaction
you
either
hate
it
or
you
love
it
.
i
personally
enjoyed
it
to
full
extent
.
holden
caulfield
is
a
young
boy
who
criticizes
those
around
him
and
does
n't
want
to
grow
up
yet
is
contradicting
himself
loads
throughout
the
book
.
the
author
writes
with
real
emotion
and
does
n't
hold
back
on
language
.
all
in
all
holden
is
really
just
a
kid
not
ready
to
take
the
responsibility
of
growing
up
.
one
of
my
favorite
books
.
