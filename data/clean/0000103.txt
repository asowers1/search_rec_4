the
book
makes
use
of
the
false
document
technique
and
opens
with
higgins
describing
his
discovery
of
the
concealed
grave
of
thirteen
german
paratroopers
in
an
english
graveyard
.
what
follows
was
inspired
by
the
real
life
rescue
of
hitler
's
ally
benito
mussolini
by
otto
skorzeny
.
a
similar
idea
is
considered
by
hitler
with
the
strong
support
of
himmler
.
admiral
wilhelm
canaris
head
of
the
abwehr
german
military
intelligence
is
ordered
to
make
a
feasibility
study
of
the
seemingly
impossible
task
of
capturing
british
prime
minister
winston
churchill
and
bringing
him
to
the
reich
.
canaris
realizes
that
although
hitler
will
soon
forget
the
matter
himmler
will
not
.
fearing
himmler
may
try
to
discredit
him
canaris
orders
one
of
his
officers
oberst
radl
to
undertake
the
study
despite
feeling
that
it
is
all
just
a
waste
of
time
and
effort
.
an
unteroffizier
on
radl
's
staff
finds
that
one
of
their
spies
code
named
starling
has
provided
a
tantalizing
piece
of
intelligence
.
``
at
any
other
time
in
any
other
place
this
information
would
be
useless
''
radl
said
.
``
and
then
synchronicity
rears
its
disturbing
head
.
''
winston
churchill
is
scheduled
to
spend
a
relaxing
weekend
at
a
country
house
near
the
village
of
studley
constable
norfolk
.
there
joanna
grey
an
afrikaner
woman
and
longtime
abwehr
agent
lives
.
she
detests
england
because
she
was
abused
and
raped
by
british
soldiers
and
her
husband
daughter
and
parents
were
killed
during
the
anglo-boer
war
.
as
a
result
of
her
reports
radl
devises
a
detailed
plan
to
intercept
churchill
and
return
with
him
to
germany
.
although
radl
is
certain
the
plan
has
real
possibilities
admiral
canaris
orders
him
to
abandon
it
.
himmler
however
has
already
learned
of
the
scheme
and
summons
radl
.
he
orders
him
to
proceed
but
without
notifying
canaris
.
in
response
radl
arranges
for
liam
devlin
a
member
of
the
irish
republican
army
to
be
smuggled
to
norfolk
by
way
of
northern
ireland
.
posing
as
a

he
contacts
mrs.

while
awaiting
further
developments
devlin
becomes

eastern
front
steiner
had
intervened
when

jews
at
a
railway
station
in
poland
.
to
the
outrage
of
the
ss
and
polizei
he
took
one
of
their
men
hostage
and
helped
a
teenage
jewess
to
escape
on
a
passing
freight
train
.
for
this
he
was
court-martialled
along
with
his
men
