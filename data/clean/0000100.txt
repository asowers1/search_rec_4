by
umberto
eco
the
italian
semiotician
and
now
novelist
as
well
bring
us
by
a
commodius
vicus
of
recirculation
back
to
the
year
1327
.
the
preface
would
have
us
believe
that
in
1968
eco
was
handed
a
translation
made
in
1842
by
a
french
abbã
of
a
fourteenth-century
latin
manuscript
by
a
benedictine
monk
one
adso
of
melk
.
adso
has
a
horrible
history
to
tell
of
murderous
doings
ending
in
ecpyrosis
in
a
benedictine
monastery
near
the
apennines
.
these
deeds
are
elaborately
crisscrossed
by
the
factions
and
schisms
of
the
time
.
eco
would
probably
say
that
the
structure
is
closed
rather
than
open
as
befits
a
medieval
situation
and
certainly
his
book
hangs
tightly
and
conclusively
together
.
it
is
not
the
less
strange
for
that
.
the
name
of
the
rose
succeeds
in
being
amusing
and
ambitious
at
the
same
time
.
it
can
be
regarded
as
a
philosophical
novel
masked
as
a
detective
story
or
as
a
detective
story
masked
as
a
historical
novel
or
even
better
as
a
blend
of
all
three
.
the
venture
sounds
improbable
but
eco
carries
it
out
.
though
his
previous
books
have
often
been
technical
contributions
to
semiotics
he
has
written
well
about
such
writers
as
ian
fleming
eugãne
sue
and
james
joyce
as
well
as
about
such
subjects
as
the
superman
comic
strip
.
new
to
the
novelists
business
he
is
thoroughly
in
control
.
his
title
would
seem
to
be
explained
by
the
final
sentence
in
which
adso
years
after
the
events
described
writes
i
leave
this
manuscript
i
do
not
know
for
whom
i
no
longer
know
what
it
is
about
stat
rosa
pristina
nomine
nomina
nuda
tenemus
.
un
latined
this
seems
to
mean
that
he
offers
the
thing
itself
and
not
the
interpretation
.
the
rose
is
a
rose
in
all
its
being
and
name
as
for
us
in
a
fallen
and
later
time
we
hear
only
empty
names
.
this
is
not
the
only
use
of
latin
in
the
book
some
of
its
flavor
comes
from
a
sporadic
interfusion
of
such
phrases
most
of
them
quickly
paraphrased
though
this
one
is
not
.
the
name
of
the
rose
is
delineated
in
seven
days
as
if
to
suggest
some
medieval
version
of
the
unities
based
upon
the
days
of
creation
.
these
seven
days
are
in
their
turn
divided
into
sections
based
upon
the
canonical
hours
.
eco
offers
two
diagrams
almost
as
elaborate
as
those
that
appear
in
his
works
on
semiotics
.
one
is
of
the
monastery
itself
an
imposing
edifice
the
other
is
of
the
library
which
is
planned
as
a
labyrinth
.
he
also
affords
us
the
teasing
pleasure
of
a
code
based
upon
the
zodiacal
figures
.
what
adso
has
to
tell
is
unexpected
.
he
is
a
bumbling
sobersided
pietistic
dr.
watson
and
he
accompanies
a
franciscan
monk
from
england
william
of
baskerville
.
williams
mission
is
to
negotiate
between
the
emperor
louis
iv
and
that
dubious
pope
john
xxii
whose
name
no
other
pope
would
take
until
the
twentieth
century
