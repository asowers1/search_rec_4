introduction
next
in
a
nutshell
welcome
you
and
nine
strangers
have
just
arrived
in
a
mansion
on
an
isolated
island
having
received
invitations
from
various
acquaintances
or
someone
named
u.n.
owen
.
because
thatâs
not
creepy
.
anyway
bring
out
the
glowsticks
and
fizzy
drinks
because
you
are
here
to
paaaartay
.
only
it
looks
like
your
definition
of
âpartyâ
might
be
just
a
wee
bit
different
from
your
hosts
.
turns
out
youâre
actually
here
for
a
game
.
a
game
where
your
life
is
at
stake
.
thatâs
the
basic
setup
for
one
of
mystery
writer
agatha
christieâs
best-known
and
oft-parodied
works
and
then
there
were
none
originally
titled
nsfw
language
ten
little
indians
or
ten
little
ns
.
it
was
a
different
and
uglier
time
.
one
by
one
each
of
the
guests
is
accused
of
a
different
murder
and
then
slowly
picked
off
in
accordance
with
an
old
nursery
rhyme
about
âten
little
soldiers.â
as
the
characters
race
to
figure
out
who
among
them
is
the
culprit
we
have
to
try
to
piece
together
the
clues
red
herrings
and
that
frustrating
and
creepy
poem
.
if
this
all
sounds
like
a
gripping
page-turner
youâd
be
right
and
then
there
were
none
is
a
classic
mystery
thatâll
keep
you
on
your
toes
and
have
you
looking
over
your
shoulder
while
youâre
reading
it.but
itâs
not
all
fun
and
games
.
besides
the
usual
romp
to
find
a
killer
before
he
finds
you
the
book
also
grapples
with
the
idea
of
justice
.
is
it
justified
that
someone
else
is
killing
off
all
these
people
because
they
spoiler
alert
committed
crimes
is
it
okay
for
someone
to
take
justice
into
his
or
her
own
hands
no
wonder
this
book
was
adapted
into
radio
almost
as
soon
as
it
was
published
in
1939
or
that
there
are
well
over
a
dozen
film
radio
tv
and
even
game
adaptations
.
consider
this
agatha
christie
has
sold
two-billion-plus
books
putting
her
behind
only
will
shakespeare
and
the
bible
.
can
two
billion
readers
be
wrong
why
should
i
care
um
because
if
youâre
ever
stuck
on
an
island
with
a
bunch
of
possibly
murderous
criminals
wouldnât
you
want
to
know
how
to
surviveno
but
seriously
.
and
then
there
were
none
is
one
of
those
texts
thatâs
so
foundational
youâre
missing
out
on
a
big
chunk
of
pop
culture
if
you
havenât
read
it
.
or
ahem
at
least
skimmed
the
shmoop
learning
module
.
thereâs
even
a
family
guy
episode
called
âand
then
there
were
fewerâ
in
which
everyone
is
invited
to
you
guessed
it
an
isolated
island
mansion
and
slowly
killed
off
.
or
take
the
idea
of
a
killer
who
uses
some
kind
of
creepy
nursery
rhyme
or
some
existing
common
list
in
order
to
decide
the
order
of
his
or
her
victimsâlike
the
guy
in
se7en
who
tracks
down
victims
based
off
of
the
seven
deadly
sins
.
but
you
know
what
you
donât
have
to
ever
turn
on
the
tv
or
pick
up
another
book
to
enjoy
and
then
there
were
none
.
christie
is
a
master
of
her
form
stringing
us
along
as
we
race
to
the
end
of
the
book
to
see
whoâif
anyoneâmakes
it
out
alive
.
if
you
think
that
no
book
could
be
as
exciting
or
horrifying
as
a
movie
just
try
putting
this
one
down
.
