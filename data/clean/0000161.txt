legend
has
it
that
a
tortured
soul
called
davy
jones
lives
beneath
the
sea
with
a
terrible
sea
beast
at
his
command
.
unfortunately
for
the
notorious
pirate
captain
jack
sparrow
this
particular
legend
is
very
real
.
years
ago
jack
made
a
deal
with
davy
jones
who
is
now
expecting
him
to
make
good
on
his
promise
by
handing
himself
over
to
jonesâs
servitude
.
but
jack
will
not
give
in
without
a
fight
which
is
especially
bad
news
for
will
turner
and
elizabeth
swann
who
always
seem
to
get
caught
up
in
jackâs
mishaps
.
if
jack
canât
find
a
way
to
rid
himself
of
davy
jones
once
and
for
all
it
may
just
spell
the
end
for
the
three
adventurers
