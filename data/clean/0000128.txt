primarily

in
the
storyline
differences
between
special
sets
and
their
theatrical
counterparts
so
here
are
the
differences
between
the
two
note
spoilers
follow.the
extended
collector
's
edition
runs
16
minutes
28
seconds
longer
than
the
theatrical
cut
and
listed
below
are
the
major
differences.1
the
opening
scene
is
different
and
starts
with
jake
in
a
wheelchair
on
earth
in
a
blade
runner-esque
earth
city
.
the
scene
moves
to
scenes
of
jake
in
his
apartment
then
taking
liquid
shots
in
a
bar
.
jake
's
narration
of
``
i
told
myself
i
can
pass
any
test
a
man
can
pass
''
and
``
they
can
fix
the
spinal
if
you
got
the
money
.
but
not
on
vet
benefits
not
in
this
economy
''
are
inserted
during
this
new
opening
scene.jake
beats
up
a
bar
patron
who
is
mistreating
a
woman
and
then
jake
and
wheelchair
are
unceremoniously
thrown
outside
by
bouncers
into
an
alley
.
while
in
the
alley
jake
meets
the
two
rda
representatives
who
bring
him
news
of
his
brother
's
untimely
death
.
then
the
movie
cuts
back
to
the
original
theatrical
cut
where
jake
sees
his
brother
's
body
cremated
then
awakes
in
space.2
during
jake
's
initial
flyover
of
pandora
in
his
avatar
they
witness
a
herd
of
sturmbeasts
buffalo-like
creatures.3
after
seeing
the
sturmbeasts
grace
jake
and
norm
stop
by
grace
's
old
english
school
for
the
na'vi
.
the
school
is
now
closed
abandoned
and
some
walls
are
riddled
with
bullet-holes
.
norm
finds
a
dr.
seuss
book
``
the
lorax
''
on
the
ground
.
this
scene
explains
how
neytiri
knew
english
so
well
and
certainly
gives
some
further
backstory
into
grace
augustine
's
character.interestingly
the
lorax
can
be
seen
as
a
metaphor
for
the
pandoran
story.read

i
got
this
as
soon
as
i
found
it
available
on
the
net
.
it
will
not
be
available
commercially
for
some
time
and
that
of
course
means
the
price
is
way
to
high
for
most
viewers
.
i
was
willing
to
be
taken
for
a
ride
but
if
you
do
not
just
have
to
have
it
now
i
would
recommend
waiting
until
it
is
available
everywhere.the
video
quality
is
fantastic
.
i
have
a
samsung
40
''
3d
setup
and
the
movie
was
just
beautiful
to
watch
.
not
quite
the
same
as
imax
but
very
close
size
of
screen
being
the
only
difference
that
i
could
see
.
the
3d
is
to
my
eyes
exactly
as
good
as
the
imax
on-screen
version
.
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
the
movie
but
believe
me
i
would
tell
you
if
the
video
quality
was
not
great.i
would
not
hesitate
to
do
the
purchase
again
even
considering
the
huge
rip-off
in
price
at
this
time
but
advise
others
to
consider
if
you
really
have
to
have
it
right
now
or
can
wait
awhile.great
movie
almost
unbelievable
video
transfer
quality
and
a
price
that
is

off
by
kevin

on

blu-ray
there
are
many
low
score
reviews
purely
based
on
the
fact
there
was
a
release
of
this
movie
earlier
this
year
and
now
the
extended
version
comes
out
feels
like
a
marketing
game
.
when
the
first
release
happened
it
was
known
an
extended
version
was
coming
but
some
people
just
had
to
have
it
now
.
i
just
watched
it
on
netflix
and
waited
for
the
extended
version
.
i
agree
if
you
bought
the
first
release
version
you
have
little
real
reason
to
buy
the
extended
version
unless
you
love
this
movie
and
want
the
bonus
features.some
of
the
other
low
scores
talk
about
the
3d
version
coming
but
that
is
weak
reason
for
most
people
because
most
do
not
own
and
will
not
own
a
3d
tv
set
.
if
you
do
your
research
on
3d
tvs
you
will
find
they
clunky
and
costly
.
unless
you
are
among
the
few
who
have
a
3d
tv
then
there
is
no
reason
to
wait
to
buy
this
release
of
avatar
if
you
enjoyed
the
movie.for
the
few
who
have
never
seen
the
movie
the
key
factors
to
consider
is
if
you
are
a
science
fiction
fan
enjoy
action
movies
and
if
you
consider
yourself
picky
about
dialogoriginality
avatar
breaks
no
new
ground
when
it
comes
to
story
but
it
does
take
many
of
successful
elements
from
other
stories
and
rolls
it
into
this
one
.
the
bashing
on
acting
is
overkill
.
in
general
they
did
a
fine
job
not
exceptional
but
anyone
who
loves
science
fiction
will
find
the
acting
a
step
above
the
normal
for
this
type
of
movie
.
the
dialog
is
nothing
special
.
there
are
mostly
cliche
characters
and
situations
.
the
key
is
the
entire
package
is
very
well
done
.
no
movie
is
perfect
and
as
much
as
some
people
bash
this
just
look
at
the
box
office
sales
.
bad
movies
would
have
never
set
top
sales
records
no
matter
how
much
marketing
was
behind
it.read

buy
the
special

or
3d
version
instead1
.
a
special
edition
including
20
minutes
of
additional
footage
was
released
just
months
after
theatrical
edition
.
but
fans
were
n't
told
until
it
was
too
late2
.
no
special
features
in
2
disc
theatrical
edition
.
if
you
are
a
fan
of
all
the
discs
in
your
collection
this
is
the
one
you
really
want
the
extra
stuff.3
.
3d
version
also
now
available
though
not
in
the
extended
version
yet
.
this
movie
is
considered
a
reference
disc
in
3d
and
the
extensive
cgi
use
makes
it
a
great
story
to
be
seen
in
that
medium
as
are
most
animated
movies
.
hopefully
a
3d
extended
version
will
be
released
soon.regarding
the
multiple
releases
while
holding
back
on
the
whole
package
the
studios
are
becoming
so
brazen
.
offering
bare
bones
blu
rays
shortly
before
re-releasing
the
movie
with
additional
footage
was
a
classless
act
that
kicks
dirt
in
the
face
of
fans
.
i
completely
understand
the
business
side
of
the
equation
.
however
i
think
we
would
all
like
to
see
them
release
multiple
versions
and
let
fans
decide
how
much
they
need
verses
how
much
to
spend
.
at
least
release
a
complete
package
a
year
or
so
on
.
there
still
is
n't
an
extended
3d
version
us
general
release
at
the
time
of
my
update
dec
2014
.
the
first
3d
release
was
just
the
theatrical
edition
even
though
the
extended
footage
was
already
available
.
it
's
like
pulling
teeth
to
get
these
studios
to
release
everything
fans
want
in
a
single
package
even
down
the
road
.
after
all
the
releases
we
have
had
they
really
owe
it
to
fans
to
do
something
for
us
rather
than
themselves
.
we
all
understand
the
business
side
and
multiple
releases
are
no
surprise
.
but
seriously
this
is
somewhat
an
old
movie

who

thinks

old
story
the
soldiers
in
the
movie
were
not
official
military
.
they
were
previous
military
but
in
the
movie
were
employed
by
the
company
.
that
makes
them
mercenaries
an
important
distinction
