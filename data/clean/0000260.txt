inception
does
a
difficult
thing
.
it
is
wholly
original
cut
from
new
cloth
and
yet
structured
with
action

so
it
feels
like
it

one
of
the
best
things
about
nolan
as
a
director
is
that
heâs
not
self-conscious
.
his
movies
unfold
and
fold
in
on
themselves
without
the
strain
of
labor
or
flash
.
but
that
lack
of
self-consciousness
is
also
nolanâs
downside

what

so

is
that

bits

pieces
of
what
makes
inception
so
special
is
that
it
's
not
your
typical
straight
forward

.
nolan
gives
you
bits

of
information
and
as
the
movie
plays
out
the
viewer
begins
to
put
the
pieces
together
and
the
picture
gradually
becomes
clearer
.
chris
nolan
does
n't
dumb
down
the
movie
for
the
audience
like
most
hollywood
movies
do
these
days
he
expects
us
to

and
when
we
do
the
reward
is
extremely
gratifying

the

rather
more
its
gripping
tale
of
taking
a
simple
idea
in
our
mind
and
create
pretty
much
whatever
we
see
fit

expert

to
return
to

peace

his
children
cobb
is
asked
to
commit
'inception
'
planting
an
idea
inside
a
subjects
subconscious
while
they
are
asleep
.
christopher
nolan
has
created
not
necessarily
something
to
baffle
and
dumbfound
the
audience
but
a
big-budget
look
at
what
we
can
create
using
something
that
will
never
go
away
...
an
idea
.
cobb
with
the
aid
of
his
associate
arthur
joseph
gordon-levitt
pull
together
a
team
to
help
infiltrate
the
mind
of
robert
fischer
cillian
murphy
.
the
team
consists
of
ellen
page
as
the
architect
creating
the
dream
world
ariadne
expert
forger
eames
tom
hardy
and
mr
saito
ken
watanabe
the
business
man
trying
to
remove
the
competition
of
dissolving
fischer
's
fathers
corporation
through
inception
.
while
stunning
visuals
epic
set
pieces
and
superb
storytelling
are
all
a-plenty
its
the
source
which
created
these
excellent
moments
that
is
the
most
wonderous
part
of
the
film
the
unique
mind-provoking
yet
simplistic
plot
of
dreaming
.
it
's
all
a
wonderfully
scripted
puzzle
which
we
the
viewer
must
piece
together
make
us
think
and
question
what
we
believe
to
be
real
.
it
's
also
the
way
in
which
its
portrayed
onscreen
that
they
are
trying
to
tell
as
if
we
should
already
know
that
this
is
all
possible
they
do
n't
overkill
the
idea
they
simply
remind
us
that
it
could
be
a
dream
.
christopher
nolan
does
n't
try
to
simplify
his
film
at
all
he
merely
wants
the
viewer
to
grasp
its
concept
and
think
what
they
will
for
themselves
.
dicaprio
puts
in
a
stellar
performance
as
cobb
he
brings
the
sense
that
his
character
has
been
there
too
long
at
what
he
does
and
portrays
this
through
his
avoidance
at
direct
open
ended
conversations
with
ariadne
who
suspects
the
whole
operation
could
be
blown
due
to
cobb
's
unwillingness
to
let
go
of
his
wife
mal
marion
cotillard
.
spectacular
set-pieces
set
up
a
thrilling
finale
to
this
outstanding
tale
and
what
culminates
in
the
story
will
be
seen
as
a
cliff
hangar
to
some
but
a
sense
of
closure
brought
about
by
excellent
storytelling
and
convincing
performances
from
the
ensemble
cast
inception
definitely
asks
the
viewer
to
think
about
it
for
a
while
and
even
then
you
still
might
not
be
able
to
explain
what
exactly
you
seen
but
that
it
definitely
needs
to
be
planted
in
your
subconscious
.

i
become
aware
that
i
am
in
a
dream
and
i
just
transport
or
change
positions
without
concern
.
nolan
has
managed
to
take
this
interesting
topic
of
dream
state
and
make
a
wholly
original
film
exploring
what
is
``
real
.
''
in
addition
to
the
originality
the
cast
and
editing
are
top-notch
.
the
way
the
movie
was
edited
and
directed
adds
to
the
ambiguity
by
never
really
having
a
starting
point
.
i.e
.
``
how
did
you
get
here
''
nolan
definitely
expects
us
to
keep
up
with
him
.
he
rarely
dumbs
down
the
dialogue
reiterating
things
we
already
know
.
after
all
i
am
now
grown
and
know
it
is
all
just
a
dream

better

if

this

that
is

breathtaking
