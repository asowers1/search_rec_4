hi
awesome
site
just
wanted
to
say
hello
and
also
mention
that
the
final
phase
of
the
beatles
was
based
fully
on
the
bible
.
check
out
my
site
to
get
the
whole
story
.
for
example
and
of
course
henry
the
horse
dances
the
waltz
comes
from
revelation
12
18
.
what
is
odd
is
that
no
one
until
now
ever
asked
the
obvious
question
that
is
how
many
steps
are
required
to
do
the
waltz
.
look
it
up-
the
answer
is
6
which
repeats
as
long
as
one
dances
giving
us
666..get
the
entire
story
then
sit
back
and
watch
the
world
kill
rock
and
roll
and
christianity
just
as
john
stated
would
happen
be
strong

i
think
it
was
in
one
of
lee
strobels
books
interviewing
experts
and
one
mentioned
the
actual
number
is
665
in
the

he
said

i
suppose
there
is
a
luck
of
one
good
song
which
was
issued
as
a
demo
.
the
song
is
called
goodbye
and
its
granted
by
lennonmccartney
but
was
of
course
mccartney
lyrics
from
abbey
road
sessions

im
not

sure
what
you
mean

youre
referring
to
the
mary

paul

it

yeah
i
think
i
was
somehow
wrong
.
this
song
was
for
mary
.
however
im
little
bit
confused
hearing
all
abbey
road
sessions
when
there
was
a
lot
of
songs
sung
but
they
were
actually
not
a
beatles
songs
like
lennons
give
peace
a
chance
instant
karma
mccartneys
come
and
get
it
etc

i
agree
there
are
many
more
songs
that
the
beatles
jammed
to
or
recorded
but
not
released
.
also
there
is
a
site
that
lists
more
than
250
albums
with
their
discography
.
of
course
there
are
many
duplicates
but
there
are
also
literally
hundreds
of
songs
that
are
not
on
this
list
.
btw
there
are
some
