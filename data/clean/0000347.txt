1
waterloo
1974
perhaps
the
very
first
song
that
comes
to
mind
when
most
think
about
abba
âwaterlooâ
is
every
bit
as
fresh
today
as
if
it
was
recorded
yesterday
.
this
is
the
track
that
propelled
abba
to
fame
when
it
won
the
1974
eurovision
song
contest
and
summarily
topped
the
charts
all
over
the
world
.

sos
1975
not
only
had
the
song
been
loved
by
people
all
over
the
world
but
âsosâ
was
also
the
song
singled
out
by
the
likes
of
john
lennon
and
all
manner
of
music
icons
as
one
of
abbaâs
best
ever
.
it
has
a
somewhat
darker
element
to
the
music
and
yet
remains
an
all-time
dance
floor
classic
.

mamma
mia
1975
the
second
no.1
of
all
abba
songs
and
the
one
that
some
insist
saved
the
band
âmamma
miaâ
is
a
seriously
iconic
title
thatâs
of
course
now
graced
west
end
theatres
and
the
big
screens
of
hollywood
.
a
phenomenal
success
story
like
nothing
weâve
seen
or
heard
to
date
.

fernando
1976
itâs
a
little
known
fact
but
âfernandoâ
was
actually
supposed
to
be
a
solo
single
for
just
one
of
the
members
of
abba
but
it
ended
up
so
successful
that
they
released
it
as
a
group
effort
.
it
topped
the
charts
in
australia
for
14
weeks
and
still
sells
by
the
boatload
today
.

dancing
queen
1976
this
is
one
of
abba
songs
that
is
still
enjoyed
by
people
around
the
whole
world
.
released
almost
40
years
ago
âdancing
queenâ
is
every
bit
the
pop
masterpiece
.
not
only
did
it
top
the
charts
all
over
the
world
but
queen
elizabeth
even
once
admitted
that
whenever
this
song
is
played
at
royal
functions
she
can
not
help
but
have
a
dance
.
quite
the
seal
of
approval
.
6
knowing
me
knowing
you
1977
whatâs
most
interesting
about
âknowing
me
knowing
youâ
is
the
way
in
which
the
tune
as
a
whole
is
so
upbeat
despite
the
fact
that
the
song
is
all
about
the
fraying
relationships
between
the
bandâs
members
.
things
were
going
very
wrong
but
they
still
put
out
a
global
superhit
.
7
take
a
chance
on
me
1978
one
of
the
catchiest
intros
ever
put
down
on
vinyl
and
with
a
wonderfully
upbeat
tune
throughout
âtake
a
chance
on
meâ
has
to
date
sold
millions
of
copies
the
world
over
and
is
still
a
staple
at
parties
discos
and
weddings
all
over
the
place
.
8
i
have
a
dream
1979
a
slightly
slower
tune
from
the
swedish
super
group
itâs
almost
unthinkable
but
âi
have
a
dreamâ
did
not
in
fact
make
it
into
the
charts
in
the
us
.
the
folks
in
the
uk
however
took
much
more
kindly
to
it
and
drove
the
song
to
no.2
.
it
was
later
covered
by
irish
boy
band
westlife
.

the
winner
takes
it
all
1980
another
song
that
climbed
the
charts
all
over
the
world
âthe
winner
takes
it
allâ
didnât
quite
have
the
same
success
as
dancing
queen
but
was
nonetheless
voted
as
the
ukâs
all-time
favorite
abba
song
.
itâs
graced
more
movies
and
tv
show
soundtracks
than
itâs
possible
to
recount
.

one

1981
the
final

single
written

abba

penned
at
the
time
of
the
couplesâ
divorces
and
telling
a
tale
of
tragedy
it
didnât
do
quite
so
well
as
prior
upbeat
tunes
but
was
still
a
great
success
in
the
uk
