share
of
all
the
bands
and
artists
beloved
to
me
whose
song
catalogs
weve
tried
to
rank
that
of
the
iconic
progressive-rock
group
pink
floyd
has
been
the
most
difficult
.
this
is
largely
because
the
floyd
is
an
album-oriented
band
and
most
of
their
best
work
the
dark
side
of
the
moon
the
wall
wish
you
were
here
was
designed
to
be
listened
to
as
a
single
cohesive
unit
.
all
the
same
many
of
the
bands
songs
are
powerful
enough
to
stand
alone
independently
so
with
the
remastering
campaign
why
pink
floyd
now
fully
underway
we
wanted
to
celebrate
the
mind-melting
individual
highs
of
this
unique
profound
and
relentlessly
adventurous
band
that
has
given
us
so
much
strength
and
inspiration
over
the
years
.

the
final
cut
2004
reissue
one
of
the
bands
oft-overlooked
gems
when
the
tigers
broke
free
could
originally
only
be
heard
in
the
wall
film
and
is
bassist
and
leader
roger
waters
most
direct
tribute
to
his
father
eric
fletcher
waters
who
died
in
combat
during
world
war
ii
.
an
orchestral
piece
that
evokes
the
solemn
atmosphere
of
wwii
its
lyrics
skewer
the
english
government
for
trivializing
the
lives
lost
in
battle
and
treating
such
a
serious
matter
mechanically
which
is
one
reason
it
fits
into
the
context
of
the
wall
so
well
its
a
direct
parallel
to
waters
overarching
theme
of
another
brick
in
the
wall
.

goodbye
blue
sky
album
the
wall
a
short
acoustic-based
piece
goodbye
blue
sky
morphs
almost
impossibly
from
gentle
beautiful
harmonic
passages
into
chilling
harrowing
darkness
multiple
times
during
its
less-than-three-minute
run
.
in
the
context
of
the
walls
story
its
a
lament
for
the
failure
of
the
post-war
dream
a
promise
that
involvement
in
war
and
conflict
would
help
solve
the
worlds
problems
and
lead
to
better
society
.
it
also
stays
consistent
with
the
message
of
the
english
governments
disregard
for
those
who
suffered
because
of
it
.
best
seen
along
with
its
animated
sequence
from
the
wall
film
which
juxtaposes
elements
of
nazism
with
christianity
amid
a
horrifying
war-torn
landscape

one
of
the
first
songs

in
the
wake
of
syd

breakdown
and
subsequent
dismissal
from
the

true
to
barretts

influence

replaces
the
fallen
genius
characteristic
whimsy
with
a
more
formal
somber
and
haunting
tone
one
that
would
become
common
in
pink
floyds
later
work
.
driven
by
a
hypnotic
eastern-tinged

line
the
studio
version
pales
in
comparison
to
its
wildly
experimental
extended
versions
of
floyds
live
shows
of
the
era
.
the
live
half
of
ummagumma
showcases
set
the

at
its
most
riveting

have
a
cigar
album
wish
you
were
here
have
a
cigar
has
the
distinction
of
being
the
only
pink
floyd
song
whose
lead
vocal
is
sung
by
someone
who
isnt
a
member
save
clare
torrys
performance
on
the
great
gig
in
the
sky
though
her
vocal
part
functions
as
more
of
an
instrument
.
the
story
goes
that
roger
waters
intended
to
sing
it
but
his
voice
was
suffering
from
severe
strain
during
the
sessions
so
they
got
english
folk
singer
roy
harper
to
fill
in
.
harpers
performance
dovetails
beautifully
with
the
slick
funky
track
that
concerns
the
dangers
of
giving
up
creative
and
artistic
integrity
when
faced
with
monumental
success
â
waters
direct
response
to
the
watershed
sales
of
the
dark

the
instrumental
one
of

eugene
album
ummagumma
never
officially
released
on
a
studio
album
careful
with
that
axe
eugene
was
one
of
the
first
fully
collaborative
pieces
written
by
pink
floyd
after
syd
barretts
departure
.
whereas
at
first
david
gilmour
seemed
to
struggle
to
hone
his
sound
as
the
groups
new
guitarist
careful
with
that
axe
is
one
of
the
first
signs
of
his
potential
creating
an
airy
ethereal
atmosphere
during
the
buildup
and
providing
bluesy
lead
work
during
roger
waters
famous
scream
section
.
as
it
represented
a
band
finding
its
feet
after
losing
its
original
leader
careful
with
that
axe
quickly
became
a
fan
favorite
and
a
staple
of

atom

mother
album
atom
heart
mother
beginning
with
a
saucerful
of
secrets
pink
floyd
began
experimenting
with
a
specific
multi-movement
epic
form
of
songwriting
that
bordered
on
the
classical
.
atom
heart
mother
was
the
bands
second
stab
at
this
opus
technique
this
time
taking
its
classical
implications
more
literally
employing
avant-garde
composer
ron
geesin
to
collaborate
with
them
on
a
23-plus-minute
song
.
moving
through
an
orchestrated
western-sounding
theme
and
into
a
haunting
choir
section
an
ultra-funky
jam
section
and
back
around
to
the
main
theme
it
shows
pink
floyd
at
its
most
ambitious
and
musically
creative
up
to
that
point
.
roger
waters
and
david
gilmour
would
later
decry
this
suite
and
its
namesake
album
in
their
later
years
dismissing
it
as
childish
and
rubbish
but
most
hardcore
floyd
fans
still
hold

brain

eclipse
album
the

side
of
the

any
album
closer
more
climactic
and
emotional
than
the
sequence
of
brain
damage
and
eclipse
if
there

ive

one
.
bringing
together
all
of
the
universal
themes
and
questions
raised
during
the
course
of
the
dark
side
of
the
moon
the
two-part
piece
details
the
ultimate
danger
of
what
can
happen
to
the
human
mind
when
faced
with
all
the
fears
and
problems
inherent
in
modern
life
.
never
known
for
being
compassionate
roger
waters
offers
a
glimpse
of
that
side
here
with
the
central
line
ill
see
you
on
the
dark
side
of
the
moon
directly
relating
to
and
empathizing
with
syd
barretts
mental
instability
and
insanitya
theme
that
foreshadows
the
subsequent
tribute
to
barrett
wish
you
were
here
.
eclipse
goes
on
to

up
all
of
the
things
and
choices
that

sheep
album
animals
sheep
is
the
final
segment
of
the
dense
monolithic
animals
and
the
third
component
of
waters
bleak
orwellian
concept
where
he
callously
divides
up
the
human
race
into
dogs
pigs
and
sheep
.
naturally
the
sheep
caste
of
humans
represents
those
who
are
driven
by
comfort
and
security
and
are
often
afraid
to
think
for
themselves
and
question
authority
.
in
the
context
of
the
song
propelled
by
a
signature
dark
bass
line
and
featuring
eerie
keyboard
work
from
richard
wright
the
sheep
are
manipulated
by
the
pigs
the
upper
crust
to
turn
on
the
dogs
the
competitive
ruthless
achievers
of
society
they
eventually
overwhelm
and
defeat
them
in
sheer
numbers
.
the
central
message
is
quite
clear
for
the
pigs
its
all
just
a
big
game
.

speak
to
me
breathe
album
the
dark
side
of
the
moon
the
slow
faint
pulse
of
a
heartbeat
that
opens
the
sound
collage
speak
to
me
and
segues
into
breathe
has
nearly
become
a
clichã
due
to
the
immense
stature
of
the
dark
side
of
the
moon
but
in
actuality
its
an
entirely
appropriate
opening
effect
for
an
album
that
so
candidly
examines
the
core
of
life
and
the
human
condition
.
breathe
replete
with
gorgeous
slide
guitar
work
from
david
gilmour
and
keyboardist
richard
wrights
jazzy
chord
progressions
is
a
laid-back
melancholy
prelude
to
the
madness
that
follows
it
.
the
song
also
features
some
of
waters
most
simple
direct
lyrics
encouraging
the
listener
to
not
be
afraid
to
seriously
assess
their
lives
breathe
breathe
in
the
air
dont
be
afraid
to
care
