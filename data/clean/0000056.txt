the
da

code
fact
or
fiction
what
isâ
the
da
vinci
code
the
da
vinci
codeâ
is
a
novel
.
its
publisher
doubleday
released
it
with
much
fanfare
in
march
2003
and
heavily
promoted
it
.
as
a
result
it
debuted
at
1
on
the
new
york
times
bestseller
list
and
has
remained
on
it
since
selling
millions
of
copies
.
the
publisher
claims
that
it
is
``
the
bestselling
adult
novel
of
all
time
within
a
one-year
period
.
''
so
popular
hasâ
the
da
vinci
codeâ
become
that
it
has
created
a
marketing
boom
for
books
related
to
the
novel
and
it
has
become
the
subject
of
a
major
motion
picture
scheduled
to
be
released
in
2005
.
what
isâ
the
da
vinci
codeâ
about
it
is
a
thriller
story
involving
secret
societies
conspiracies
the
catholic
church
and
the
fictional
``
truth
''
about
jesus
christ
.
here
is
the
author
's
own
summary
a
renowned
harvard
symbologist
is
summoned
to
the
louvre
museum
to
examine
a
series
of
cryptic
symbols
relating
to
da
vinci
's
artwork
.
in
decrypting
the
code
he
uncovers
the
key
to
one
of
the
greatest
mysteries
of
all
time
.
.
.
and
he
becomes
a
hunted
man.1
during
the
course
of
the
novel
it
is
alleged
that
the
catholic
church
is
perpetuating
a
major
centuries-long
conspiracy
to
hide
the
``
truth
''
about
jesus
christ
from
the
public
and
it
or
its
agents
are
willing
to
stop
at
nothing
including
murder
to
do
so
.
what
does
leonardo
da
vinci
have
to
do
with
the
story
da
vinci
is
portrayed
as
a
former
head
of
the
conspiracy
guarding
the
``
truth
''
about
jesus
christ
.
in
the
novel
he
is
said
to
have
planted
various
codes
and
secret
symbols
in
his
work
particularly
in
his
painting
of
the
last
supper
.
according
to
the
novel
this
painting
depicts
jesus
'
alleged
wife
mary
magdalene
next
to
him
as
a
symbol
of
her
prominence
in
his
true
teaching
.
in
reality
the
figure
that
dan
brown
identifies
as
mary
magdalene
is
john
the
evangelist
who
traditionally
has
been
regarded
as
the
youngest
of
the
apostles
and
so
is
often
pictured
in
medieval
art
without
a
beard
.
why
should
a
catholic
be
concerned
about
the
novel
although
a
work
of
fiction
the
book
claims
to
be
meticulously
researched
and
it
goes
to
great
lengths
to
convey
the
impression
that
it
is
based
on
fact
.
it
even
has
a
``
fact
''
page
at
the
front
of
the
book
underscoring
the
claim
of
factuality
for
particular
ideas
within
the
book
.
as
a
result
many
readers-both
catholic
and
non-catholic-are
taking
the
book
's
ideas
seriously
.
the
problem
is
that
many
of
the
ideas
that
the
book
promotes
are
anything
but
fact
and
they
go
directly
to
the
heart
of
the
catholic
faith
.
for
example
the
book
promotes
these
ideas
jesus
is
not
god
he
was
only
a
man
.
jesus
was
married
to
mary
magdalene
.
she
is
to
be
worshiped
as
a
goddess
.
jesus
got
her
pregnant
and
the
two
had
a
daughter
.
that
daughter
gave
rise
to
a
prominent
family
line
that
is
still
present
in
europe
today
.
the
bible
was
put
together
by
a
pagan
roman
emperor
.
jesus
was
viewed
as
a
man
and
not
as
god
until
the
fourth
century
when
he
was
deified
by
the
emperor
constantine
.
the
gospels
have
been
edited
to
support
the
claims
of
later
christians
.
in
the
original
gospels
mary
magdalene
rather
than
peter
was
directed
to
establish
the
church
.
there
is
a
secret
society
known
as
the
priory
of
sion
that
still
worships
mary
magdalene
as
a
goddess
and
is
trying
to
keep
the
truth
alive
.
the
catholic
church
is
aware
of
all
this
and
has
been
fighting
for
centuries
to
keep
it
suppressed
.
it
often
has
committed
murder
to
do
so
.
the
catholic
church
is
willing
to
and
often
has
assassinated
the
descendents
of
christ
to
keep
his
bloodline
from
growing
.
catholics
should
be
concerned
about
the
book
because
it
not
only
misrepresents
their
church
as
a
murderous
institution
but
also
implies
that
the
christian
faith
itself
is
utterly
false
.
should
other
christians
be
concerned
about
the
book
definitely
.
only
some
of
the
offensive
claims
ofâ
the
da
vinci
codeâ
pertain
directly
to
the
catholic
church
.
the
remainder
strike
at
the
christian
faith
itself
.
if
the
book
's
claims
were
true
then
all
forms
of
christianity
would
be
false
except
perhaps
for
gnosticfeminist
versions
focusing
on
mary
magdalene
instead
of
jesus
.
who
is
the
author
of
the
book
the
author
is
dan
brown
.
he
is
a
former
english
teacher
who
has
authored
three
previous
books
.
the
first
twoâ
digital
fortressâ
andâ
deception
point
were
techno-thrillers
.
with
his
third
novelâ
angels
demons
he
turned
to
writing
thrillers
involving
religion
and
the
vatican.â
the
da
vinci
codeâ
continues
in
that
vein
and
it
was
popular
enough
to
revive
sales
of
the
previous
books
which
had
lackluster
performance
and
pull
them
onto
the
bestseller
list
.
brown
plans
to
useâ
the
da
vinci
codeâ
as
the
springboard
for
a
new
series
of
similar
books
using
its
hero
robert
langdon
and
which
will
be
``
set
in
paris
london
and
washington
d.c.
''
2â
in
the
next
novel
slated
for
release
in
summer
2005
``
langdon
will
find
himself
embroiled
in
a
mystery

soil
.
this

capital

what
is
the
author
's
religious
background
he
claims
to
be
a
christian-of
a
sort
.
a
``
frequently
asked
questions
''
page
on
his
web
site
contains
the
following
exchange
are
you
a
christiani
am
although
perhaps
not
in
the
most
traditional
sense
of
the
word
.
if
you
ask
three
people
what
it
means
to
be
christian
you
will
get
three
different
answers
.
some
feel
being
baptized
is
sufficient
.
others
feel
you
must
accept
the
bible
as
immutable
historical
fact
.
still
others
require
a
belief
that
all
those
who
do
not
accept
christ
as
their
personal
savior
are
doomed
to
hell
.
faith
is
a
continuum
and
we
each
fall
on
that
line
where
we
may
.
by
attempting
to
rigidly
classify
ethereal
concepts
like
faith
we
end
up
debating
semantics
to
the
point
where
we
entirely
miss
the
obvious-that
is
that
we
are
all
trying
to
decipher
life
's
big
mysteries
and
we
're
each
following
our
own
paths
of
enlightenment
.
i
consider
myself
a
student
of
many
religions
.
the
more
i
learn
the
more
questions
i
have
.
for
me
the
spiritual
quest
will
be
a
life-long
work
in
progress.4
what
is
a
``
symbologist
''
according
toâ
webster
's
dictionary
a
symbologist
is
``
one
who
practices
or
who
is
versed
in
symbology
''
the
latter
being
defined
as
``
the
art
of
expressing
by
symbols
.
''
needless
to
say
this
is
not
a
common
term
.
brown
uses
the
term
not
just
to
refer
to
a
person
who
has
studied
symbolism
but
as
the
name
of
a
pseudo-academic
discipline
.
in
fact
harvard
university
has
no
department
of
symbology
and
thus
the
idea
of
making
the
hero
of
the
novel
``
a
renowned
harvard
symbologist
''
is
simply
fanciful
.

impression
that

i
would
like
to
acknowledge

also
thanks
a
bookstore
for
``

down
so
many
of

''
as
well
as
a
long
list
of
specific
individuals
.
it
is
not
clear
how
many
of
these
acknowledgements
represent
brown
padding
the
list
to
make
it
sound
more
impressive
and
enhance
his
credibility
.
for
example
project
gutenberg
is
an
online
library
of
public
domain
texts
and
brown
's
``
acknowledgement
''
may
signify
no
more
than
that
he
looked
at
a
text
on
one
of
the
project
gutenberg
web
sites
.
the
same
may
well
be
true
of
others
included
in
the
list
.
the
acknowledgements
of
museums
libraries
and
similar
institutions
may
mean
no
more
than
that
he
used
their
facilities
and
that
they
did
nothing
special
to
assist
his
research
.
this
in
fact
appears
to
be
the
case
regarding
his
acknowledgement
of
catholic
world
news
.
when
contacted
by
catholic
answers
the
editor
of
catholic
world
news
phil
lawler
stated
we
were
surprised
and
bemused
to
learn
that
catholic
world
news
had
been
listed
in
the
acknowledgments
of
this
book
.
we
can
not
recall
any
contact
whatsoever
with
dan
brown
.
he
is
not
listed
among
our
past
or
present
subscribers
.
since
many

it
is
possible
that
he

scholars
do
not
take

seriously
.
the
author
ofâ
the
da

codeâ
does
take
them
seriously
.
as
the
list
reveals
he
is
particularly
dependent
on
the
works
by
margaret
starbird
and
the
trio
of
authors
michael
baigent
richard
leigh
and
henry
lincoln
.
an
additional
particularly
important
source
for
brown
is
the
bookâ
the
templar
revelation
.
who
is
margaret
starbird
her
web
site
describes
her
as
a
``
roman
catholic
scholar
''
whose
researchers
alerted
her
to
``
an
underground
stream
of
esoteric
devotees
of
the
'sacred
feminine
'
incarnate
in
mary
magdalene
.
''
afterwards
while
still
purporting
to
be
catholic
she
began
publishing
books
extolling
``
the
'sacred
union
'
of
jesus
and
mary
magdalene
.
''
according
to
her
web
site
''
starbird
's
research
traces
the
origin
and
extent
of
the
heresy
of
the
holy
grail
whose
medieval
adherents
believed
that
jesus
was
married
and
that
his
wife
and
child
emigrated
to
gaul
fleeing
persecutions
of
the
infant
christian
community
in
jerusalem
.
''
``
starbird
's
new
book
explodes
the
myth
of
the
celibate
jesus
revealing
truths
encoded
in
symbolic
numbers
in
the
gospels
themselves
by
the
authors
of
the
greek
new
testament
.
this
book
demonstrates
unequivocally
that
the
'sacred
union
'
of
jesus
and
his
lost
bride
was
the
true
cornerstone
of
early
christianity
.
''
``
starbird
's
latest
book
explains
how
the
painful
situation
in
the
roman
catholic
priesthood
has
roots
in
systematic
denial
of
the
'bride
'
as
partner
and
in
the
insistence
on
a
celibate
jesus
encouraging
worship
of
the
ascendant
masculine
principle
stripped
of
its
feminine
partner
.
''
``
early
christianity
was
fundamentally
egalitarian
but
later
influences
conspired
to
curtail
the
role
of
women
in
the
church
.
this
text
seeks
to
reclaim
the
gender-balanced
christianity
implicit
in
the
gospels
.
''
``
her
inevitable
conclusion
is
that
'sacred
union
'
was
originally
at
the
very
heart
of

christian
gospels.5

in

words

one
reviewer
l.
d.
meagher
the
book
attempts
to
convince
you
that
everything
you
know
about

is
wrong
.
the
nativity

a
myth
the
ministry
of
jesus
has
been
misrepresented
and
the
crucifixion
may
have
been
a
publicity
stunt
that
went
awry
.
the
truth
has
been
purposely
suppressed
for
two
millennia
by
men
who
were
bent
on
promoting
their
own
agenda
beginning
with
early
church
leaders
including
the
apostles
peter
and
paul
.
who
says
so
the
same
people
who
claim
the
shroud
of
turin
is
a
photograph
of
leonardo
da
vinci.7
that
is
correct
.
in
their
prior
bookâ
turin
shroud
in
whose
image
lynn
picknett
and
clive
prince
maintain
that
the
shroud
of
turin
is
a
fake
made
with
a
primitive
photographic
process
developed
by
leonardo
da
vinci
and
used
to
record
his
own
image
on
cloth
.
now
they
're
back
with
a
new
book
that
picks
up
where
their
prior
one
left
off
their
research
into
the
shroud
convinced
them
that
leonardo
was
a
leading
member
of
a
mysterious
society
called
the
priory
of
sion
.
they
believe
the
priory
arose
in
the
middle
ages
alongside
another
secret
order
the
knights
templar
.
unlike
the
templars
however
picknett
and
prince
claim
the
priory
of
sion
is
alive
and
well
and
carefully
manipulating
events
today.8
as
one
might
suspect
the
work
is
far
from
scholarly
.
meagher
characterizes
the
authors
'
way
of
evaluating
evidence
as
follows
that
which
seems
to
have
neither
merit
nor
meaning
must
be
both
true
and
vitally
important
.
armed
with
this
upside-down
viewpoint
picknett
and
price
plunge
into
an
investigation
of
the
shadow
world
of
heresy
and
occultism.â

.â
.
nothing
inâ
the
templar
revelationâ
rises
to
anything
like
the
level
of
``
definite
proof
.
''
instead
its
conclusions
are
based
on
the
flimsiest
of
premises
which
are
supported
by
the
slimmest
of
indirect
and
circumstantial
evidence
or
just
as
often
by
the
assertion
that
the
lack
of
evidence
justifies
their
conclusions
.
in
the
end
picknett
and
prince
propose
that
a
murky
conspiracy
has
been
at
work
for
nearly
2000
years
.
two
conspiracies
in
fact
one
involving
all
denominations
of

spearheaded
by

vatican
suppresses
the
truth
while
the
other
stage-managed
by

hides
it.9
it
is
uponâ

whatâ

claims
what
specific
claims
does
the
book
make
on

dei
a
major
focus
of
the
book
and
the
descriptions
found
in

book
of

and
rituals
.
although
the
``
fact
''
page
presents
the
book
's
most
overt
claims
to
accuracy
the
novel
itself
implies
that
much
more
is
factual
than
what
is
stated
on
this
page
.
the
book
is
written
in
a
way
that
suggests
that
its
claims
regarding
the
priory
of
sion
the
catholic
church
and
christ
are
to
be
taken
seriously
.
the
author
's
own
remarks
outside
of
the

suggest
the
same
.
on
his
personal
web
page
he
speaks
of
the
historical
``
secret
''
he
reveals
inâ
the
da

codeâ
and
states
the
secret
i
reveal
is
one
that
has
been
whispered
for
centuries
.
it
is
not
my
own
.
admittedly
this
may
be
the
first
time
the
secret
has
been
unveiled
within
the
format
of
a
popular
thriller
but
the
information
is
anything
but
new.10
what
does
the
book
claim
regarding
the
priory
of
sion
according
to
the
``
fact
''
page
the
priory
of
sion-a
european
secret
society
founded
in
1099-is
a
real
organization
.
in
1975
paris'sâ
bibliothãque
nationaleâ
discovered
parchments
known
asâ
les
dossiers
secretes
identifying
numerous
members
of
the
priory
of
sion
including
sir
isaac
newton
botticelli
victor
hugo
and
leonardo
da
vinci
.
the
novel
goes
on
to
depict
the
priory
of
sion
as
a
secret
society
defending
the
bloodline
of
jesus
christ
and
mary
magdalene
.
because
it
allegedly
holds
the
secret
of
this
bloodline
it
is
persecuted
by
the
catholic
church
.
the
organization
also
is
devoted
to
worshiping
``
the
sacred
feminine
''
and
holds
orgies
as
a
form
of
ritual
worship
.
what
wereâ
les
dossiers
secretes
they
are
a
group
of
documents
found
in
theâ
bibliothãque
nationaleâ
that
ostensibly
established
the
historical
pedigree
of
the
priory
of
sion
secret
society
.
the
documents
were
popularized
in
the
1970s
and
formed
the
basis
of
the
booksâ
holy
blood
holy
grailâ
the
messianic
legacy
and
laterâ
the
da
vinci
code
.
the
documents
were
created
by
a
group
headed
by
a
convicted
confidence
trickster
named
pierre
plantard
.
thoughâ
the
da
vinci
codeâ
continues
to
regard
the
documents
as
authentic
many
other
writers
of
esoteric
``
history
''
have
acknowledged
that
they
are
fakes
.
even
the
authors
ofâ
holy
blood
holy
grailâ
andâ
the
messianic
legacyâ
later
came
to
question
them
.
authors
carl
olson
and
sandra
miesel
note
the
messianic
legacyâ
recounts
much
hugger-mugger
about
missing
documentation
and
forged
signatures
until
baigent
and
company
begin
to
doubt
plantard
's
candor
.
well
they
should
have
because
the
dossiers
give
every
appearance
of
having
been
``
salted
''
into
the
library
with
pseudonymous
by-lines
and
falsified
publication
dates
.
the
process
somewhat
resembles
recent
cases
of
people
inserting
spurious
information
about
works
of
art
into
existing
library
catalogues
to
create
a
false
pedigree
for
their
merchandise
.
dan
brown
's
other
major
source
of
esoteric
ideasâ
the
templar
revelation
dismisses
the
dossiers
as
fabrications.11
what
is
the
real
story
on
the
priory
of
sion
the
priory
of
sion
was
a
club
founded
in
1956
by
four
young
frenchmen
.
two
of
its
members
were
andrã
bonhomme
who
was
president
of
the
club
when
it
was
founded
and
pierre
plantard
who
previously
had
been
sentenced
to
six
months
in
prison
for
fraud
and
embezzlement
.
the
group
's
name
is
based
on
a
local
mountain
in
france
col
du
mont
sion
not
mount
zion
in
jerusalem
.
it
has
no
connection
with
the
crusaders
the
templars
or
previous
movements
incorporating
``
sion
''
into
their
names
.
the
organization
broke
up
after
a
short
time
but
in
later
years
pierre
plantard
revived
it
claimed
he
was
the
``
grand
master
''
or
leader
of
the
organization
and
began
making
outrageous
claims
regarding
its
antiquity
prior
membership
and
true
purposes
.
it
was
he
who
claimed
that
the
organization
stemmed
from
the
crusades
he
in
conjunction
with
later
associates
who
composed
and
saltedâ
les
dossiers
secretesâ
in
theâ
bibliothãque
nationale
and
he
who
created
the
story
that
the
organization
was
guarding
a
secret
royal
bloodline
that
could
one
day
return
to
political
power
.
what
evidence
is
there
that
this
is
the
history
of
the
priory
after
plantard
's
claims
regarding
the
priory
came
to
public
attention
his
former
associates
contradicted
him
.
in
a
1996
statement
made
to
the
bbc
by
the
priory
of
sion
's
original
president
andrã
bonhomme
stated
the
priory
of
sion
does
n't
exist
anymore
.
we
were
never
involved
in
any
activities
of
a
political
nature
.
it
was
four
friends
who
came
together
to
have
fun
.
we
called
ourselves
the
priory
of
sion
because
there
was
a
mountain
by
the
same
name
close-by
.
i
have
n't
seen
pierre
plantard
in
over
twenty
years
and
i
do
n't
know
what
he
's
up
to
but
he
always
had
a
great
imagination
.
i
do
n't
know
why
people
try
to
make
such
a
big
thing
out
of
nothing.12
the
bbc
itself
concluded
there
's
no
evidence
for
a
priory
of
sion
until
the
1950s
to
find
it
you
go
to
the
little
town
of
st.
julien
.
under
french
law
every
new
club
or
association
must
register
itself
with
the
authorities
and
that
's
why
there
's
a
dossier
here
showing
that
a
priory
of
sion
filed
the
proper
forms
in
1956
.
according
to
a
founding
member
this
eccentric
association
took
its
name
not
from
jerusalem
but
from
a
nearby
mountain
col
du
mont
sion
alt
.
786
m.
the
dossier
also
notes
that
the
priory
's
self-styled
grand
master
pierre
plantard
who
is
central
to
this
story
has
done
time
in
jail.13

what
evidence
is
there
that
pierre
plantard
was
a
confidence
trickster
paul
smith
notes
pierre
plantard
was
sentenced
on
december
17
1953
by
the
court
of
st.
julien-en-genevois
to
six
months
in
prison
for
breaking
the
french
law
relating
to
``
abus
de
confiance
''
fraud
and
embezzlement
.
the
evidence
for
this
is
found
in
a
letter
written
by
the
mayor
of
annemasse
in
1956
to
the
sub-prefect
of
st.
julien-en-genevois
which
can
be
found
in
the
file
that
contains
the
1956
statutes
of
the
priory
of
sion
and
the
1956
registration
documents
of
the
priory
of
sion
in
our
archives
we
have
a
note
from
the
i.n.s.s.e
dated
15
december
1954
advising
us
that
monsieur
pierre
plantard
was
sentenced
on
17
december
1953
by
the
court
in
st.
julien-en-genevois
to
six
months
imprisonment
for
a
'breach
of
trust
'
under
articles
406
and
408
of
the
penal
code.14
in
the
1980s
plantard
asserted
that
he
had
spent
a
number
of
years
in
retirement
from
the
priory
of
sion
during
which
time
a
man
named
roger-patrice
pelat
had
served
as
its
grand
master
.
following
the
death
of
pelat
plantard
claimed
to
have
regained
his
position
as
priory
grand
master
.
pelat
however
had
been
involved
in
a
corruption
scandal
and
plantard
eventually
became
involved
in
the
investigation
of
this
scandal
by
the
french
courts
.
paul
smith
notes
when
judge
thierry
jean-pierre
became
the
presiding
french
judge
heading
the
enquiry
into
the
patrice
pelat
financial
corruption
scandal
of
the
1980s
plantard
voluntarily
came
forward
during
the
1990s
offering
evidence
to
the
enquiry
claiming
that
pelat
had
been
a
``
grand
master
of
the
priory
of
sion
.
''
the
judge
ordered
a
search
of
plantard
's
house
which
uncovered
a
hoard
of
priory
of
sion
documents
claiming
plantard
to
be
the
``
true
king
of
france
.
''
the
judge
subsequently
detained
plantard
for
a
forty-eight
hour
interview
and
after
asking
plantard
to
swear
on
oath
plantard
admitted
that
he
made
everything
up
whereupon
plantard
was
given
a
serious
warning
and
advised
not
to
``
play
games
''
with
the
french
judicial
system
.
this
happened
in
september
1993
and
it
was
all
reported
in
the
french
press
of
the
period
.
this
was
the
reason
for
the
final
termination
of
the
priory
of
sion
in
1993.15
pierre
plantard
died
in
2002
.
how
does
the
priory
of

presented
inâ
the
da

codeâ
compare
with
the
priory
of
sion
co-founded
by

and
miesel
note
that
in
order
to
suit
his
own
agenda
of
promoting
worship
of
``
the

''
brown
adapted
the
priory
of

as
presented
inâ

and
similar
works
spurious
documents

and
admiring
books
concerning
the
actual
priory

.
lists
of
famous
grand
masters
were
produced
.
goddess-worship
however
was
not
part
of
the
agenda
unlike
brown
's
version
of
the
priory
.
in
1975
plantard
began
calling
himself
``
plantard
de
st.
clair
''
to
pretend
a
connection
with
a
noble
scottish
family
involved
with
freemasonry
who
'd
built
the
strange
chapel
of
rosslyn
near
edinburgh
.
this
is
whyâ

claims
the
blood
of
christ
survived
most
directly
in
the
plantard

despiteâ
the

code'sâ
indirect
acknowledgement
of

the
secret
society
at
the
core
of
the
book
remains
a
product
of
the
fevered
imagination
of
a
convicted
con
man
.
olson
and
miesel
conclude
although
the
false
history
of
the
priory
has
been
repeatedly
exposed
in
france
and
on
the
bbc
in
1996
not
to
mention
tireless
debunking
by
researcher
paul
smith
since
at
least
1985
dan
brown
wants
his
readers
to
think
it
's
real
and
that
its
preposterous
claims
are
genuine
.
the
commercial
need
to
feed
the
public
's
taste
for
conspiracy
clearly
is
trumping
truth.17
what
doesâ
the
da

codeâ
claim
regarding
opus
dei
according
to
the
``
fact
''
page
the
vatican
prelature
known
as
opus
dei
is
a
deeply
devout
catholic
sect
that
has
been
the
topic
of
recent
controversy
due
to
reports
of
brainwashing
coercion
and
a
dangerous
practice
known
as
``
corporal
mortification
.
''
opus
dei
has
just
completed
construction
of
a
47
million
national
headquarters
at
243
lexington
avenue
in
new
york
city
.
the
novel
goes
on
to
describe
opus
dei
as
``
a
catholic
church
''
and
portrays
it
as
an
order
of
monks
with
members
serving
as
assassins
one
of
whom
a
``
hulking
albino
''
named
silas
is
a
key
character
in
the
book
.
what
is
the
history
of
the
real-world
opus
dei
according
to
opus
dei
's
u.s.
communications
director
brian
finnerty
the
real
opus
dei
was
founded
in
spain
in
1928
by
a
catholic
priest
st.
josemarãa
escrivã
with
the
purpose
of
promoting
lay
holiness
.
it
began
to
grow
with
the
support
of
the
local
bishops
there
and
was
approved
as
a
secular
institute
of
pontifical
right
by
the
holy
see
in
1950
.
opus
dei
's
work
has
been
blessed
and
encouraged
by
popes
john
xxiii
paul
vi
john
paul
i
and
john
paul
ii
.
in
1982
john
paul
ii
established
it
as
a
personal
prelature
of
the
catholic
church
after
careful
study
of
its
role
in
the
church
's
mission
.
the
culmination
of
the
church
's
support
for
opus
dei
and
its
message
came
with
the
2002
canonization
of
its

18
how
does
the
real-world
opus

compare
to
the
one
inâ
the
da

code
there
is
a
large
number
of
inaccuracies
in
the
picture
of
opus
dei
painted
by
the
novel
.
some
of
the
most
significant
are
catalogued
and
critiqued
by
finnerty
the
author
evinces
a
remarkable
lack
of
understanding
of
the
structure
of
the
catholic
church
and
its
various
component
institutions
.
besides
his
mischaracterization
of
opus
dei
as
``
a
sect
''
he
variously
calls
it
``
a
catholic
church
''
a
``
congregation
''
a
``
personal
prelature
of
the
pope
himself
''
and
a
``
personal
prelature
of
vatican
city
.
''
calling
opus
dei
``
a
catholic
church
''
makes
no
sense
.
opus
dei
provides
supplemental
spiritual
formation
rather
than
ordinary
diocesan
functions
except
in
a
few
isolated
cases
in
which
the
pope
or
a
bishop
has
asked
opus
dei
to
take
care
of
some
task
.
moreover
it
is
intrinsic
to
the
concept
``
catholic
''
that
there
can
be
only
one
catholic
church
the
catholic
church
and
opus
dei
is
a
fully
integrated
part
of
it
.
congregationâ
is
also
a
term
that
can
not
be
applied
to
opus
dei
since
it
refers
to
religious
.
the
veryâ
raison
d'etreâ
of
opus

is
to
provide
a
way
of
holiness
for
people
who
are
not
called

took
place
in
a.d.

the

states
until
that
moment
in

jesus
was
viewed
by
his
followers
as
a
mortal

.
.
.
a
great
and
powerful
man

a
man
nonetheless

a
mortal
.
.
.
.
by
officially
endorsing
jesus
as
the
son
of
god
constantine
turned
jesus
into
a
deity.20
it
is
true
that
constantine
following
his
conversion
to
christ
presided
over
the
first
council
of
nicaea
but
it
is
not
true
that
constantine
``
turned
jesus
into
a
deity
''
or
that
christians
had
not
viewed
jesus
as
god
prior
to
this
event
.
constantine
had
called
the
council
together
to
settle
a
dispute
that
had
arisen
when
a
priest
from
egypt
named
arius
began
to
deny
that
jesus
was
god
causing
a
scandal
by
repudiating
the
faith
of
christians
everywhere
.
arius
gained
a
number
of
followers
known
as
arians
and
the
controversy
between
the
arians
and
traditional
christians
grew
so
sharp
that
the
emperor
called
the
council
to
settle
the
matter
.
personally
constantine
tended
to
support
the
position
of
the
arians
but
he
recognized
the
authority
of
the
bishops
in
articulating
the
christian
faith
and
the
bishops
of
the
council
reaffirmed
the
traditional
christian
teaching
that
jesus
was
fully
divine
.
it
was
thus
the
bishops
of
the
council
of
nicaea
who
reaffirmed
the
historic
christian
position
against
arius
and
his
followers
.
constantine
recognized
their
authority
to
do
so
in
spite
of
the
fact
he
would
have
preferred
a
different
outcome
.
what
evidence
is
there
that
christians
regarded
christ
as
god
before
the
council
of
nicaea
christ
's
divinity
is
stressed
repeatedly
in
the
new
testament

for
example

are
told
that

he
``

how
do
you
answer

is
asserting

to
deny

evidence

he

not
back

up

there

no

there
is
a
number
of
reasons
for
this
some
of
which

one
reason
is
that
the

in
fact
it
claims
that
jesus
got
mary
magdalene
pregnant
and
the
two
had
a
daughter
.
the
book
states
mary
magdalene
was
pregnant
at
the
time
of
the
crucifixion
.
for
the
safety
of
christ
's
unborn
child
she

it
was
there
in

that
she
gave

to

name

claims
that
this
union
gave
rise
to
a
bloodline
that
still
exists
in
prominent
european
families
including
one
of
the
book
's
main
characters

it
also
claims

not
only
was
jesus

married

he
was

.
the
early
church
feared
that
if
the
lineage
were
permitted
to
grow
the
secret
of
jesus
and
magdalene
would
eventually
surface
and
challenge
the
fundamental
catholic
doctrine-that
of
a
divine
messiah
who
did
not
consort
with
women
or
engage
in
sexual
union
.
.
.
.
many
of
the
vatican
's
grail
quests
here
were
in
fact
stealth
missions
to
erase
members
of

royal
bloodline.23
how
do
you
respond
to
these
claims
it
is
irresponsible
and
offensive
for
brown
to
impugn
the
faith
of
countless
catholics
in
this
fashion
.
he
has
no
solid
evidence
to
support
these
contentions
and
in
the
absence
of
such
evidence
it
is
unacceptable
to
smear
the
faith
of
millions
with
these
charges
.
a
comparable
smear
would
be
saying
that
lutherans
have
been
murdering
the
descendants
of
luther
or
that
jewish
leaders
have
been
murdering
the
descendants
of
moses
.
if
such
charges
were
made
particularly
with
no
evidence
they
would
be
regarded
instantly
as
vicious
and
bigoted
slanders
against
what
other
people
hold
sacred
.
claiming
that
catholics
have
been
killing
the
descendants
of
their
god
is
a
vile
and
unacceptable
assault
on
their
faith
.
people
of
all
faiths
should
regard
dan
brown
as
the
viciously
bigoted
man
that
it
takes
to
make
this
kind
of
charge
.
what
is
one
to
make
ofâ
the
da
vinci
code
's
specific
claim
that
jesus
was
married
to
mary
magdalene
it
is
impossible
to
take
this
claim
seriously
.
the
reason
that
brown
and
a
handful
of
others
chiefly
new
age
authors
have
tried
to
identify
mary
magdalene
as
the
wife
of
jesus
is
obvious
she
is
one
of
the
few
women
disciplines
of
christ
who
is
prominent
whose
name
we
know
and
whom
we
do
n't
know
was
married
to
someone
else
.
other
female
disciples
of
jesus
are
known
to
be
married
to
others
e.g
.
joanna
the
wife
of
chuza
luke

are
too
insignificant
``

or
we
do
n't
know
their
names
the
syro-phoenecian
woman
matt
.
1528
.
if
one
wants
to
force
jesus
into
the
role
of
being
married
mary
magdalene
is
one
of
the
few
prominent
and
seemingly
available
women
to
be
pushed
into
the
role
of
being
his
wife
.
furthermore
there
is
nothing
in
the
new
testament
that
states
or
implies
that
jesus
was
married
to
mary
magdalene
.
according
to
the
new
testament
mary
of
magdala
was
a
devout
follower
of
christ
and
one
of
the
first
witnesses
of
his
resurrection
cf
.
matt
.
281
but
not
his
wife
.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
new
testament
or
the
writings
of
the
church
fathers
that
she
was
married
to
jesus
.
jesus
also
said
things
that
indicated
that
he
was
n't
married
to
anyone
.
he
explained
that
some
voluntarily
refrain
from
marrying
in
order
to
be
fully
consecrated
to
god
.
he
says
that
they
``
have
made
themselves
eunuchs
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
's
sake
''
matt
.
1912
.
he
portrays
voluntary
abstention
from
marriage
as
the
highest
form
of
consecration
and
as
the
spiritual
leader
of
the
christian
movement
it
would
be
strange
for
him
to
hold
up
such
a
standard
if
he
himself
did
not
meet
it
.
moreover
the
early
church
was
unanimous
in
regarding
jesus
as
unmarried
.
this
is
not
a
later
doctrine
of
the
church
fathers
but
something
found
in
the
new
testament
itself
.
the
authors
of
the
new
testament
regularly
depict
the
church
as
``
the
bride
of
christ
''
2
cor

eph

521-33
cf

this
metaphor
would
never
have
developed
if
a
flesh-and-blood
``
mrs.
jesus
''
was
living
just
down
the
street
.
only
if
christ
was
celibate
would
the
church
have
come
to
be
depicted
metaphorically
as
his
bride
.
what
does
brown
claim
regarding
mary
magdalene
's
role
in
the
early
church
brown
asserts
that
in
the
original
gospels
mary
magdalene
rather
than
peter
was
directed
to
establish
the
church
according
to
these
unaltered
gospels
it
was
not
peter
to
whom
christ
gave
directions
with
which
to
establish
the
christian
church
.
it
wasâ
mary
magdalene.â
.â
.â
.
jesus
was
the
original
feminist.24
again
there
is
no
basis
for
this
claim
.
none
of
the
early
manuscripts
of
the
gospels
nor
any
of
the
quotations
of
the
gospels
in
the
writings
of
the
early
church
fathers
suggest
that
anything
of
the
kind
was
said
at
any
stage
in
the
history
of
the
gospels
.
brown
's
assertion
that
``
jesus
was
the
original
feminist
''
is
simply
pandering
to
modern
secular
sensibilities
.
it
in
no
way
represents
the
historical
evidence
that
exists
.
appealing
to
prior
``
unaltered
''
gospels
that
had
not
been
doctored
by
constantine
or
others
in
the
early
church
is
fatuous
.
there
is
no
evidence
that
constantine
ordered
any
copies
of
scripture
to
be
changed
.
if
one
wishes
to
claim
that
he
did
give
such
an
order
one
should
be
able
to
back
it
up
with
a
citation
from
a
contemporary
source
but
no
such
passage
can
be
found
.
none
of
the
surviving
records
of
the
period-or
even
the
records
of
later
centuries-record
constantine
or
any
one
else
attempting
to
alter
the
texts
of
the
existing
canon
to
change
this
or
any
other
doctrine
.
brown
simply
has
no
evidence
to
back
up
his
claim
.
if
constantine
or
any
one
else
had
tried
to
change
scripture
christians
would
have
refused
.
the
christian
church
had
just
come
through
an
age
of
persecution
in
which
christians
had
been
burned
at
the
stake
for
refusing
to
deny
their
lord
and
the
scriptures
he
gave
them
.
to
allow
those
writings
to
be
mutilated
would
be
unthinkable
and
any
attempt
to
change
them
would
have
resulted
in
an
enormous
controversy
that
would
be
mentioned
in
the
writings
of
the
period
.
it
would
have
been
a
practical
impossibility
to
change
scripture
because
thousands
of
copies
were
in
existence
all
across
the
mediterranean
world
from
europe
to
north
africa
.
there
was
no
central
registry
of
who
had
copies
of
the
bible
so
there
was
no
way
to
track
them
down
and
edit
them
.
there
were
simply
too
many
copies
floating
in
circulation
.
but
even
if
all
of
the
copies
then
known
to
exist
had
been
tracked
down
and
altered
this
would
not
have
affected
the
copies
of
scripture
that
by
this
time
already
had
been
lost
.
many
of
the
early
manuscripts
of
scripture
that
we
now
have
were
waiting
lost
in
the
desert
until
their
discovery
by
modern
archaeology
.
but
when
we
look
at
these
copies
they
teach
the
same
doctrines
as
later
copies
and
show
no
evidence
of
having
been
censored
.
moreover
the
writings
of
the
early
church
fathers
from
before
the
time
of
constantine
show
the
same
teachings
and
quote
the
gospels
as
saying
the
same
things
as
in
the
canonical
gospels
.

responding
to
fans
ofâ
the
da
vinci
code
how
can
i
help
others
understand
how
offensiveâ
the
da
vinci
codeâ
is
point
out
the
offensive
claims
made
by
the
book
particularly
the
ones
regarding
jesus
and
early
christianity
.
point
out
that
the
claims
are
false-that
brown
does
not
have
the
evidence
to
support
them
.
the
idea
that
jesus
had
a
wife
is
absurd
.
one
of
the
major
themes
of
the
new
testament
is
that
of
the
church
as
the
bride
of
christ
.
this
theme
would
never
have
arisen
in
christian
circles
if
jesus
had
a
human
wife
.
it
was
the
fact
that
he
was
not
married
in
the
ordinary
sense
that
led
to
the
church
being
described
as
his
bride
.
what
brown
is
doing
amounts
to
smearing
the
most
important
and
sacred
beliefs
of
millions
of
people
for
the
sake
of
getting
his
novel
on
the
bestseller
list
.
to
help
others
understand
how
offensive
these
are
encourage
fans
of
the
novel
to
imagine
parallel
situations
involving
other
religions
or
groups
of
people
.
for
example
a
major
publisher
would
never
produce
a
novel
that
portrayed
the
jewish
faith
as
perpetrating
a
murderous
centuries-long
global
conspiracy
.
such
a
book
would
be
met
immediately
with
outraged
protests
and
the
author
and
publishers
publicly
branded
as
religious
bigots
.
by
producing
this
novel
smearing
christianity
brown
and
doubleday
show
that
they
have
a
double
standard
and
harbor
anti-catholic
anti-christian
prejudice
.
there
is
even
a
fairly
close
parallel
here
in
spinning
its
conspiracy
taleâ
the
da
vinci
codeâ
relies
on
information
provided
by
documents
that
are
established
forgeriesâ
les
dossiers
secretes
.
doubleday
's
release
of
the
book
is
comparable
to
a
major
publisher
releasing
a
novel
based
on
anti-jewish
forgeries
such
asâ
the
protocols
of
the
elders
of
zion
.
if
the
publisher
would
turn
down
an
anti-jewish
conspiracy
novel
based
on
these
documents
it
should
do
the
same
withâ
the
da
vinci
code
.
the
fact
that
it
did
not
do
so
reveals
a
double
standard
and
bigotry
toward
christianity
on
its
part
.
how
can
i
respond
to
the
charge
thatâ
the
da
vinci
codeâ
is
``
just
fiction
''
it
is
n't
a
defense
to
say
thatâ
the
da
vinci
codeâ
is
a
work
of
fiction
.
fiction
ca
n't
change
the
basic
facts
about
major
historical
figures
without
being
subject
to
criticism
.
people
would
be
outraged
if
doubleday
printed
a
novel
portraying
adolph
hitler
in
a
positive
light
.
christians
have
a
right
to
be
outraged
when
the
basic
historical
facts
about
christ
are
falsified
.
the
criticism
will
be
even
more
intense
when
a
publisher
releases
a
book
parodying
the
most
sacred
beliefs
of
others
in
this
fashion
.
further
as
we
have
seen
in
this
special
report
the
book
takes
great
pains
to
create
the
appearance
of
factuality
including
placing
the
infamous
``
fact
''
page
at
the
beginning
of
the
novel
.
brown
has
stressed
the
ostensible
accuracy
of
the
book
on
his
web
site
and
in
interviews
.
this
is
not
a
case
where
an
author
and
a
publisher
have
produced
an
ordinary
novel
.
they
have
gone
to
great
lengths
to
mislead
people
into
thinking
that
the
novel
has
a
historical
basis
.
they
deserve
especially
sharp
criticism
for
this
and
when
criticism
is
made
they
can
not
hypocritically
hide
behind
the
``
it
's
just
fiction
''
allegation
after
having
made
such
extensive
efforts
to
convince
the
reader
that
it
isâ
notâ
''
just
fiction
.
