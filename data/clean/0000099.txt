any
list
of
unlikely
bestsellers
from
the
last
century
the
name
of
the
rose
must
hold
a
special
place
of
distinction
.
nothing
is
rarer
than
for
a
novel
translated
from
italian
to
reach
the
top
of
the
new
york
times
bestseller
listunless
it
is
of
course
a
megahit
book
written
by
an
academic
whose
bestknown
previous
work
was
a
theoryof
semiotics
.
and
did
i
mention
thatthe
plot
revolves
around

i
still
wouldhave

yet
despite
these
obstacles
small
and
large
this
arcane
novel
sold
a

fifty
million
copies
which
puts
it
in
the
league
of

not
all
is
foreboding
and

in

the

also
follows
the
familiar

patterns
of

the
detective
okay
hes
just
a
monk
too

a
very
smart
one
william
of
baskerville
is
asked
by
the
abbot
to
get
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
.
baskerville
is
assisted
by
adso
of
melk
who
is
sort
of
a
tonsured
dr.
watson

in

i
kept

for
william
to

``
in
the
background
eco
constructs
a
labyrinth
of
supporting
plots
including
one
involving
a
labyrinth
.
william
has
arrived
at
the
abbey
as
a
representative
of
emperor
louis
iv
in
order
to
participate
in
negotiations
also
involving
emissaries
from
the
pope
who
is
in
heated
conflict
with
the
emperor
and
the
franciscan
order
then
caught
in
the
crossfire
between
secular
and
ecclesiastical
agendas
.
this
part
of
the
story
draws
the
reader
into
further
subplots
involving
heretical
and
rebellious
church
movements
and
the
various
inquisitions
and
repressive
actions
employed
in
combating
them
.
and
all
these
elements
draw
in
aspects
of
theology
philosophy
and
history
that
constantly
linger
in
the
background
of
the
name
of
the
rose
and
sometimes
dominate
the
foreground
as
well.this
may
sound
dry
and
academic
but
eco
builds
his
polemics
around
forceful
personalities
.
like
any
good
mystery
writer
he
knows
that
it
is
essential
to
populate
his
story
with
many
likely
suspects
a
plethora
of
possible
murderers
.
here
we
encounter
salvatore
the
secretive
and
gluttonous
monk
who
speaks
in
a
strange
composite
jargonmade
up
of
bits
and
pieces
of
contemporary
and
ancient
languagesand
who
is
disturbingly
vague
when
asked
about
certain
particulars
in
his
past
.
malachi
the
librarian
also
arouses
our
suspicions
he
never
allows
anyone
into
the
third
floor
of
the
aedificum
the
fortress
where
the
abbeys
rare
collection
of
manuscripts
and
books
are
held
yet
mysterious
lights
can
be
seen
through
the
windows
at
night
.
severinus
the
doctor
and
herbalist
might
also
be
a
murdererhe
knows
an
uncanny
amount
about
rare
poisons
.
jorge
of
brugos
the
blind
man
seems
to
know
even
darker
secrets
and
shows
up
quietly
and
stealthily
at
the
least
expected
moments
.
even
abo
the
abbot
is
not
above
reproach
and
comes
across
as
far
more
concerned
with
worldly
riches
and
power
than
is
befitting
for
a
benedictine
monk
.
but
the
most
compelling
character
is
our
detective
william
of
baskerville
.
have

your

has
the
benefit
of
an
oxford
education
and

by
roger
bacon
and
william
of
ockham
whose
approach
to
natural
philosophy
proves
to
be
a
good
medieval
substitute
for
a
degree
in
criminology
.
much
has
changed
in
the
world
since
the
late
middle
ages
but
there
are
some
constants
.
the
seven
deadly
sins
are
still
around
and
if
you
have
any
doubts
over
how
deadly
they
might
be
the
name
of
the
rose
will
settle
the
argument
.
eco
also
adds
a
convincing
love
story
with
just
the
right
dose
of
concupiscence
for
the
modern
readernot
easy
for
a
story
set

monastery
but
our
author
is
a
master
of
plotting
so
such
obstacles
are
deftly
overcome
.
all
in
all
the
name
of
the
rose
combines
the
best
elements
of
a
historical
romance
a
thriller
and
a
novel
of
ideas
.
yet
our
author
would
not
be
umberto

the
book
was

full
of
intertextual
intratextual

for
eco
another

the
screw

another

a

and
eco
gives
us
several
additional
turns
here
.
not
only
does
the
story
involve
texts
as
well
as
texts
that
relate
to
other
texts
not
only
do
manuscripts
figure
as
possible
clues
motives
and
weapons
in
the
name
of
the
rose
but
even
the
narrative
itself
is
reportedly
drawn
from
a
book
the
author
found
in
1968
that
contained
a
14th
century
text
from
a
benedictine
monk
adso
of

1932
in
allesandria
a
town
south
of
milan
in
the
piedmont
region
of
italy
.
he
entered
the
university
of

with
expectations
of
becoming
a

but
instead
ended
up
focusing
his
studies
on
thomas
aquinas
and
medieval
culture

many

him

serving
as
the
first
professor
of
semiotics
at
the
university
of
bologna
the
oldest
university
in
europe
.
of
course
this
was
all
prelude
to
his
transformation
into
a
novelist
which
in
typical
eco
fashion
he
did
with
grand
success
.
his
1980
novel
the
name
of

would
become
one
of
the
biggest
selling
novels
of
the
