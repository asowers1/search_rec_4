while
he
was
writing
the
original
star
wars
george
lucas
reportedly
realized
the
story
he
had
written
was
too
vast
in
scope
to
be
covered
in
one
film
.
the
original
film
was
intended
to
introduce
a
wider
story
arc
that
could
be
told
in
sequels
if
the
first
film
was
successful
.
star
wars
evolved
from
the
first
film
in
the
sequence
to
a
film
belonging
to
the
saga
's
second
trilogy.2728
by
the
time
of
the
third
draft
lucas
had
negotiated
a
contract
that
gave
him
rights
to
make
two
sequels
.
he
had
also
developed
an
elaborate
backstory
to
aid
his
writing
process.29
while
writing
the
first
sequel
the
empire
strikes
back
lucas
considered
directions
in
which
to
take
the
story
.
he
turned
the
villain
darth
vader
into
the
father
of
hero
luke
skywalker
and
developed
a
backstory
in
which
vader
was
once
jedi
knight
anakin
skywalker
a
powerful
warrior
who
defected
to
the
dark
side
of
the
force.30
with
this
backstory
in
place
lucas
decided
the
series
would
be
a
trilogy
renaming
the
film
from
``
episode
ii
''
to
``
episode
v
''
.31
by
the
time
of
the
trilogy
's
final
film
return
of
the
jedi
vader
became
a
tragic
character
and
was
ultimately
redeemed
.
lucas
said
he
was
``
burned
out
''
and
would
take
a
break
from
the
series.32
after
losing
much
of
his
fortune
in
a
divorce
settlement
in
1987
george
lucas
had
no
desire
to
return
to
star
wars
and
had
unofficially
canceled
his
sequel
trilogy
by
the
time
of
return
of
the
jedi
.
because
lucas
had
developed
most
of
the
backstory
the
idea
of
prequels
continued
to
fascinate
him.33
in
the
early
1990s
star
wars
saw
a
resurgence
in
popularity
in
the
wake
of
dark
horse
's
comic
line
and
timothy
zahn
's
trilogy
of
novels
.
lucas
saw
there
was
still
a
large
audience
for
his
idea
of
a
prequel
trilogy
and
with
the
development
of
special
effects
generated
with
computer-generated
imagery
cgi
lucas
considered
returning
to
his
saga
and
directing
the
film.34
in
1993
it
was
announced
in
variety
and
other
sources
that
he
would
be
making
the
prequels
.
lucas
began
outlining
the
story
anakin
skywalker
rather
than
obi-wan
kenobi
would
be
the
main
protagonist
and
the
series
would
be
a
tragedy
examining
darth
vader
's
origins
.
lucas
also
began
to
change
the
prequels
'
timeline
relative
to
the
original
series
``
filling-in
''
the
history
backstory
existing
parallel
or
tangential
to
the
originals
and
beginning
a
long
story
starting
with
anakin
's
childhood
and
ended
with
his
death
.
this
was
the
final
step
towards
turning
the
franchise
into
a
saga.35
george
lucas
began
writing
the
new
star
wars
trilogy
on
november
1
1994.36
the
screenplay
of
star
wars
was
adapted
from
lucas
'
15-page
outline
that
was
written
in
1976
which
he
designed
to
help
him
keep
track
of
the
characters
'
backstories
and
events
that
occurred
before
the
original
trilogy.36
anakin
was
first
written
as
a
twelve-year-old
but
lucas
reduced
his
age
to
nine
because
he
felt
the
lower
age
would
fit
better
the
plot
point
of
anakin
being
affected
by
his
mother
's
separation
from
him
.
eventually
anakin
's
younger
age
led
lucas
to
rewrite
his
participation
in
the
final
battle
small
scenes
with
him
finding
out
how
the
ship
works
and
r2-d2
helping
anakin
to
make
the
story
more
believable.37
the
film
's
working
title
was
the
beginning36
lucas
later
revealed
that
its
true
title
was
the
phantom
menace
a
reference
to
palpatine
hiding
his
true
identity
as
an
evil
sith
lord
behind
the
facade
of
a
well-intentioned
public
servant.38
the
larger
budget
and
possibilities
opened
up
by
the
use
of
digital
effects
made
lucas
``
think
about
a
much
grander
more
epic
scaleâwhich
is
what
i
wanted
star
wars
to
be
''
.39
the
story
ended
with
five
simultaneous
ongoing
plots
one
leading
to
another
.
the
central
plot
is
palpatine
's
intent
to
become
chancellor
which
leads
to
the
trade
federation
's
attack
to
naboo
the
jedi
being
sent
there
anakin
being
met
along
the
way
and
the
rise
of
the
sith
lords
.
as
with
the
original
trilogy
lucas
constructed
the
phantom
menace
to
illustrate
several
themes
through
the
narrative
.
duality
is
a
frequent
theme
amidala
is
a
queen
who
passes
as
a
handmaiden
palpatine
plays
on
both
sides
of
the
war
and
obi-wan
is
in
conflict
with
his
rebellious
master
but
eventually
becomes
qui-gon
by
confronting
his
rebellious
personality
and
accepting
his
responsibilities
.
balance
is
also
frequently
used
anakin
is
supposedly
the
one
chosen
to
bring
balance
to
the
force
and
the
characters
have
someone
to
influence
themâlucas
said
``
anakin
needed
to
have
a
mother
obi-wan
needed
a
master
darth
sidious
needed
an
apprentice
''
as
without
interaction
and
dialogue
``
you
would
n't
have
drama

for

mccallum
stated
that
his
experience
with
the
young
indiana
jones
chronicles
led
to
many
of
his
decisions
on
the
phantom
menace
such
as
long-term
deals
with
actors

soundstages
the
employment
of
recent

with
no

and
the
creation
of

started
searching

began

chiang
stated
that
lucas
intended

to
be
stylistically
different
from
the
other
star

films
it
would
be
``

the

for

by

.45
some
elements

lucas
described
the
battle
droids
as
predecessors
to
the
stormtroopers
.
chiang
uses
that
orientation
to
base
the
droids
on
the
imperial

only
in
the
same
style
of
stylized

lucas
wanted
the
lightsaber
battles
to
be
fast
and
more
intense
depicting
the
jedi
in
their
prime
.
stunt
coordinator
nick
gillard
was
recruited
to
create
a
new
jedi
fighting
style
for
the
prequel
trilogy
.
gillard
likened
the
lightsaber
battles
to
a
chess
game
``
with
every
move
being
a
check
''
.
because
of
their
short-range
weapons
gillard
thought
the
jedi
would
have
had
to
develop
a
fighting
style
that
merged
every
swordfighting
style
such
as
kendo
and
other
kenjutsu
styles
with
other
swinging
techniques
such
as
tennis
swings
and
tree-chopping
.
while
training
liam
neeson
and
ewan
mcgregor
gillard
wrote
a
sequence
which
lasted
around
60
seconds
and
intended
to
be
around
five
or
six
sequences
per
fight.47
lucas
later
referred
to
the
jedi
as
``
negotiators
''
rather
than
high-casualty
soldiers
.
the
preference
of
hand-to-hand
combat
was
intended
to
give
a
spiritual
and
intellectual
role
to
the
jedi.47
because
gillard
thought
the
stunt
jumps
with
the
actors
and
stuntmen
dangling
from
wires
did
not
look
realistic

rams
were
used
to
propel
them

lucas
decided
to
make
elaborate
costumes
because
the
film
's
society
was
more
sophisticated
than
the
one
depicted
in
the
original
trilogy
.
designer
trisha
biggar
and
her
team
created
over
1000
costumes
that
were
inspired
by
various
cultures.49
biggar

closely
with

iain
mccaig

the

from

obi-wan
's

inspired
by
the

lucas
said
he
and
biggar
would
look
at
the
conceptual
art
to
``
translate
all
of
these
designs
into
cloth
and
fabric
and
materials
that
would
actually
work
and
not
look
silly
''
.
biggar
also
consulted
gillard
to
ensure
the
costumes
would
accommodate
action
scenes
and
consulted
the
creature
department
to
find
which
fabrics
``
would

.
the
scene
in
which
toxic
gas
is
released
on
the
jedi
is
the
only
sequence
with
no
digital
alteration.19
the
work
was
so
extensive
that
three
visual
effects
supervisors
divided
the
workload
among
themselvesâjohn
knoll
supervised
the
on-set
production
and
the
podrace
and
space
battle
sequences
dennis
muren
supervised
the
underwater
sequence
and
the
ground
battle
and
scott
squires
alongside
teams
assigned
for
miniature
effects
and
character
animation
worked
on
the
lightsaber
effects.64
until
the
film
's
production
many
special
effects
in
the
film
industry
were
achieved
using
miniature
models
matte
paintings
and
on-set
visual
effectsâalthough
other
films
had
made
extensive
use
of
cgi
.
knoll
previewed
3500
storyboards
for
the
film
lucas
accompanied
him
to
explain
factors
of
the
shots
that
would
be
practical
and
those
which
would
be
created
through
visual
effects
.
knoll
later
said
that
on
hearing
the
explanations
of
the
storyboards
he
did
not
know
how
to
accomplish
what
he
had
seen
.
the
result
was
a
mixture
of
original
techniques
and
the
newest
digital
techniques
to
make
it
difficult
for
the
viewer
to
guess
which
technique
was
being
used
.
knoll
and
his
visual
effects
team
wrote
new
computer
software
including
cloth
simulators
to
allow
a
realistic
depiction
of
the
digital
characters
'
clothing
to
create
certain
shots
.
another
goal
was
to
create
computer-generated
characters
that
could
act
seamlessly
with
live-action
actors
.
while
filming
scenes
with
cgi
characters
lucas
would
block
the
characters
using
their
corresponding
voice
actors
on-set
.
the
voice
actors
were
then
removed
and
the
live-action
actors
would
perform
the
same
scene
alone
.
a
cgi
character
would
later
be
added
into
the
shot
to
complete
the
conversation.65
lucas
also
used
cgi
to
correct
the
physical
presence
of
actors
in
certain
scenes.19
practical
models
were
used
when
their
visuals
helped
with
miniature
sceneries
for
backgrounds
set
extensions
and
model
vehicles
that
would
be
scanned
to
create
the
digital
models
or
filmed
to
represent
spaceships
and
podraces.66
lucas
who
had
previously
confronted
problems
with
the
props
used
to
depict
r2-d2
allowed
ilm
and
the
production
's
british
special
effects
department
to
create
their
own
versions
of
the
robot
.
nine
r2-d2
models
were
created
one
was
for
actor
kenny
baker
to
be
dropped

built
by
ilm
and
featured
two
wheelchair
motors
capable
of
moving
440
pounds
200
kg
enabling
it
to
run
and
be
mostly
used
in
stage
sets
and
the
british
studio
produced
a
pneumatic
r2-d2
that
could
shift
from
two
to
three
legs
and
was
mostly
used
in
tunisia
because
its
motor
drive
system
allowed
it
to
drive
over
sand.67
lucas
originally
planned
to
create
many
of
the
aliens
with
computer
graphics
but
those
that
would
be
more
cost-effectively
realized
with
masks
and
animatronics
were
created
by
nick
dudman
's
creature
effects
team
.
these
included
the
neimodians
background
characters
in
mos
espa
the
jedi
council
and
the
galactic
senate
.
dudman
's
team
was
told
where
the
creatures
would
be
required
six
months
before
principal
photography
begun
and
they
rushed
the
production
.
the
neimodian
suits
which
were
originally
intended
as
digital
characters
were
delivered
one
day
before
they
would
be
required
on

.
dudman
traveled
to
skywalker
ranch
to
see
the
original
creatures
that
could
be
reused
and
read
the

for

breakdown

the
music
with

and
london
symphony

at

on

1999
.
williams
decided
to
use
electronic
instruments
such
as
synthesizers
to
enhance
the
sound
and
choral
pieces
to
``
capture
the
magical
mystical
force
that
a
regular
orchestra
might
not
have
been
able
to
provide
''
and
create
an
atmosphere
that
was
``
more
mysterious
and
mystical
and
less
military
''
than
those
of
the
original
trilogy.70
one
of
the
most
notable
tracks
is
``
duel
of
the
fates
''
which
uses
the
chorus
to
give
a
religious
temple-like
feel
to
the
epic
lightsaber
duel
.
the
track
was
made
into
a
music
video.71
while
composing
anakin
's
theme
williams
tried
to
reflect
the
innocence
of
his
childhood
and
to
foreshadow
his
transformation
into
darth
vader
by
using
slight
suggestions
of
``
the
imperial
march
''
in
the
melody.70
the

restructured

experience
it
is
not
presented
in

and
omits
many
notable

the

makes
several
references
to
historical
events
and
films
that
george
lucas
'
watched
in
his
youth
.
the
star

films
typically
mix
several
concepts
from
different
mythologies
together.74
the

practice
zen-like
meditation
and
martial
arts
as
did
the
ancient
japanese

warriors
.
the
name
``
qui-gon
''
adapts
the
term
qigong
which
refers
to
a
chinese
discipline
involving
meditation
and
cultivation
of
the
flow
of
the
vital
energy
called
``
chi
''
or
``
qi
''
for
healing
health
and
combat
.
the
words
ch'i
chinese
ki
japanese
and
the
indian
term
``
prana
''
all
refer
to
the
energy
that
is
thought
to
flow
through
all
living
things
from
the
source
of
all
chi
or
power
which
is
``
the
way
''
or
``
the
tao
''
in
chinese
philosophy
.
in
taoist
philosophy
from
the
way
yin
and
yangâthe
opposing
but
complementary
aspects
of
reality
or
natureâare
born
.
unlike
chinese
philosophy
in
which
yin
and
yang
are
not
moral
qualities
the
ancient
persian
philosophy
of
zurvanism
taught
that
the
dualism
of
dark
and
light
forces
are
locked
in
an
eternal
battle
while
being
two
sides
or
evolutes
of
the
same
``
force
''
the
force
of
time
itself
zurvanâthe
prime
mover
.
these
elements
derive
primarily
from
eastern
and
iranian
religions
and
myths.74
there
are
many
references
to
christian
beliefs
in
the
film
such
as
the
appearance
of
darth
maul
whose
design
draws
heavily
from
traditional
depictions
of
the
christian
devil
complete
with
red
skin
and
horns.74
maul
's
facial
tattoos
were
inspired
by
the
indigenous
peoples
of
brazil.39
the
star
wars
film
cycle
features
a
similar
christian
narrative
involving
anakin
skywalker
he
is
the
``
chosen
one
''
âthe
individual
prophesied
to
bring
balance
to
the
forceâwho
was
conceived
of
a
virgin
birth
and
is

anakin
's
fall
from
grace
seemingly
prevents
him
from
fulfilling
his
destiny
as
the
``
chosen
one
''
.
the
inspiration
behind
the
story
of
the
virgin
birth
parallels
a
concept
developed
by
joseph
campbell
and
his
work
on
the
hero
with
a
thousand
faces
which
heavily
influenced
lucas
'
writing

strongly
apparent
in

mask
that
borrows
from

binks

long
droopy
ears

reminiscent

creole.143
the
greedy
and
corrupt
neimoidians
of
the
trade
federation
spoke
with

the
unprincipled
trader
watto
has
been
interpreted
as

stereotype
reminiscent
