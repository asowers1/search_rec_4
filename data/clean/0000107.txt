''
higgins
is
the
master
''
so
said
tom
clancy
one
of
the
best
selling
fiction
authors
of
our
time
.
he
was
not
exaggerating
.
jack
higgins
achieved
a
top
rate
thriller
with
this
landmark
novel
that
instantly
boasted
him
to
stardom
.
the
eagle
has
landed
started
with
a
meeting
of
top
nazi
officials
in
september
1943
including
hitler
himself
.
the
allies
had
just
landed
on
continental
europe
via
italy
and
hitler
started
to
feel
the
pressure
.
the
insane
hitler
jealous
of
the
skills
of
british
commandos
fueled
on
with
himmler
's
political
manipulations
ordered
a
special
operations
mission
to
england
to
kidnap
winston
churchill
.
in
the
twisted
mind
of
adolf
hitler
it
would
bring
england
to
its
knees
and
germany
to
total
domination
of
western
europe
.
jack
higgins
'
thrilling
narratives
takes
you
from
the
dark
dungeons
of
ss
headquarters
to
the
serene
seaside
of
england
.
this
is
a
novel
that
had
me
turning
pages
deep
into
the
night
unwilling
to
stop
until
the
story
had
ended
.
the
characters
were
developed
in
enough
detail
for
you
to
truly
understand
the
actions
of
the
main
characters
from
each
side
of
the
war
.
a
favorite
character
was
perhaps
liam
devlin
a
member
of
the
ira
who
took
the
role
as
the
man
who
sat
on
the
fence
during
the
war
perhaps
mercenary
would
be
a
good
word
to
describe
him
.
his
righteous
integrity
tainted
by
his
dealings
with
germany
gave
him
a
strangely
likeable
personality
that
almost
made
me
want
to
compare
him
with
george
lucas
'
han
solo
character
from
star
wars
.
this
novel
was
written
thirty
years
ago
and
has
certainly
stood
the
trials
of
time
.
the
eagle
has
landed
continues
to
be
a
favorite
among
ww2
enthusiasts
when
it
comes
to
fiction
while
the
story
had
been
made
into
both
audio
books
and
a
film
in
1977
starring
michael
caine
robert
duvall
and
donald
sutherland
.
the
best
part
of
the
novel
is
the
believability
adding
enough
fact
to
the
fiction
so
that
the
readers
fall
deep
into
the
carefully
thought
out
plot
.
as
himmler
sat
in
his
office
in
berlin
on
6
nov
1943
he
received
the
message
``
the
eagle
has
landed
''
.
what
happened
next
would
be
a
complex
plan
to
kidnap
one
of
the
most
visible
and
popular
figures
in
england
.

read
this
book
when
i
was
in
grade
school
and
at
the
same
time
saw
the
movie
.
as
often
is
true
the
movie
did
not
quite
do
justice
to
the
book
.
tehl
shines
in
setting
historical
figures
as
the
basis
for
introducing
the
actual
central
characters
.
upon
reading
tehl
originally
the
references
to
the
britische
freikorps
british
free
corps
started
me
on
researching
ww2
in
depth
just
to
see
if
such
an
organization
did
exist
.
in
addition
after
reading
more
about
adolph
hitler
and
his
obsession
with
the
gran
sasso
rescue
of
mussolini
heinrich
himmler
and
other
prominent
german
figures
of
ww2
as
well
as
their
individual
mental
processes
it
seems
apparent
that
the
premise
behind
tehl
would
not
be
too
farfetched
.
i
would
like
to
see
a
decent
remake
of
the
movie
with
more
of
the
backstory
and
characters
added
back
in
such

i

those
