when
teenaged
andy
plops
down
on
the
grass
to
share
his
old
toys
with
a
shy
little
girl
the
film
spikes
with
sadness
and
layered
pleasure
--
a
concise
deeply
wise
expression
of
the
ephemeral
that
feels
real
and
yet
utterly
transporting
.

there
are
many
sweet
laughs
and
joking
allusions
to
horror
and
prison-break
movies
but
the
pixar
gang
gets
at
the
most
primary
fear
--
being
cast
off
and
no
longer
of
use
.

the
whole
project
is
so
masterfully
conceived
and
executed
that
you
either
go
along
for
the
ride
or
sit
in
stunned
appreciation
for
how
singularly
pixar
has
maintained
control
over
the
creative
quality
of
its
output

and
so
pixar
just
goes
and
does
it
again
as
if
it
's
the
easiest
thing
to
do
they
're
taking
characters
that
have
n't
been
used
in
10
years
and
throw
them
into
this
new
adventure
as
if
no
time
passed
.
the
film
blends
perfectly
into
its
two
predecessors
.
of
course
the
animation
has
taken
huge
steps
in
the
meantime
and
is
absolutely
flawless
and
stunningly
beautiful
.
starting
with
a
bang
of
a
beautifully
shot
action
sequence
the
film
reminds
reminds
us
of
all
the
different
characters
from
the
gang
of
toys.and
that
's
what
they
are
characters
.
although
there
are
too
many
of
them
to
give
them
all
a
lot
of
screen
time
it
just
takes
seconds
for
us
to
feel
for
them
.
when
woody
and
his
friends
hold
each
other
's
hands
later
while
facing
their
possible
demise
we
forget
that
we
're
looking
at
animated
toys
we
worry
about
them
as
if
they
were
real
.
that
's
certainly
the
biggest
asset
of
the
film
taking
its
characters
seriously
while
having
fun
with
them
.
the
story
is
a
tad
more
serious
than
before
delivering
one
of
the
greatest
prison
breaks
of
recent
movie
history
there
's
great
voice
acting
and
the
story
develops
quite
a
lot
of
speed
in
the
last
third
with
more
spectacular
and
colorful
sceneries
than
the
two
first
films
.
just
try
not
to
be
deeply
touched
by
the
last
couple
of
minutes
.
the
result
is
en
par
with
its
fantastic
predecessors
funny
sweet
touching
deeply
entertaining
.
another
triumph
for
pixar
.

it
follows
a
very
familiar
pixar
formula
but
the
studio
's
heart
and
soul
is
poured
into
every
moment
of
this
beautiful
and
hilarious
movie
and
the
ending
accomplishes
incredible
emotional
feats
