development
edit
inception
was
first
developed
by
christopher
nolan
based
on
the
notion
of
``
exploring
the
idea
of
people
sharing
a
dream
space
-
entering
a
dream
space
and
sharing
a
dream
.
that
gives
you
the
ability
to
access
somebodyâs
unconscious
mind
.
what
would
that
be
used
and
abused
for
''
furthermore
he
thought
``
being
able
to
extract
information
from
somebodyâs
brain
would
be
the
obvious
use
of
that
because
obviously
any
other
system
where
itâs
computers
or
physical
media
whatever
â
things
that
exist
outside
the
mind
â
they
can
all
be
stolen
...
up
until
this
point
or
up
until
this
movie
i
should
say
the
idea
that
you
could
actually
steal
something
from
somebodyâs
head
was
impossible
.
so
that
to
me
seemed
a
fascinating
abuse
or
misuse
of
that
kind
of
technology
''
.
he
had
thought
about
these
ideas
on
and
off
since
he
was
16
years
old
intrigued
by
how
he
would
wake
up
and
then
while
falling
back
into
a
lighter
sleep
hold
on
to
the
awareness
that
he
was
dreaming
a
lucid
dream
.
he
also
became
aware
of
the
feeling
that
he
could
study
the
place
and
alter
the
events
of
the
dream
.
he
said
``
i
tried
to
work
that
idea
of
manipulation
and
management
of
a
conscious
dream
being
a
skill
that
these
people
have
.
really
the
script
is
based
on
those
common
very
basic
experiences
and
concepts
and
where
can
those
take
you
and
the
only
outlandish
idea
that
the
film
presents
really
is
the
existence
of
a
technology
that
allows
you
to
enter
and
share
the
same
dream
as
someone
else
''
.
screenplayedit
originally
nolan
had
envisioned
inception
as
a
horror
film
but
eventually
wrote
it
as
a
heist
film
even
though
he
found
that
``
traditionally
they
are
very
deliberately
superficial
in
emotional
terms
''
.
initially
nolan
wrote
an
80-page
treatment
about
dream-stealers
.
upon
revisiting
his
script
he
decided
that
basing
it
in
that
genre
did
not
work
because
the
story
``
relies
so
heavily
on
the
idea
of
the
interior
state
the
idea
of
dream
and
memory
.
i
realized
i
needed
to
raise
the
emotional
stakes
''
.
nolan
worked
on
the
script
for
nine
to
ten
years
.
when
he
first
started
thinking
about
making
the
film
the
director
was
influenced
by
``
that
era
of
movies
where
you
had
the
matrix
you
had
dark
city
you
had
the
thirteenth
floor
and
to
a
certain
extent
you
had
memento
too
.
they
were
based
in
the
principles
that
the
world
around
you
might
not
be
real
''
.
he
first
pitched
the
film
to
warner
brothers
in
2001
but
in
retrospect
felt
that
he
needed
more
experience
making
large
scale
films
like
batman
begins
and
the
dark
knight
.
he
soon
realized
that
a
film
like
inception
needed
a
large
budget
because
``
as
soon
as
youâre
talking
about
dreams
the
potential
of
the
human
mind
is
infinite
.
and
so
the
scale
of
the
film
has
to
feel
infinite
.
it
has
to
feel
like
you
could
go
absolutely
anywhere
by
the
end
of
the
film
.
and
it
has
to
work
on
a
massive
scale
''
.
after
making
the
dark
knight
nolan
decided
to
make
inception
and
spent
six
months
completing
the
script
.
for
the
director
the
key
to
completing
the
script
was
wondering
what
would
happen
if
several
people
shared
the
same
dream
.
he
said
``
once
you
remove
the
privacy
youâve
created
an
infinite
number
of
alternative
universes
in
which
people
can
meaningfully
interact
with
validity
with
weight
with
dramatic
consequences
''
.
leonardo
dicaprio
was
the
first
actor
to
be
cast
in
the
film
.
he
read
the
script
and
found
it
to
be
``
very
well
written
comprehensive
but
you
really
had
to
have
chris
in
person
to
try
to
articulate
some
of
the
things
that
have
been
swirling
around
his
head
for
the
last
eight
years
''
.
he
and
nolan
spent
months
talking
about
the
screenplay
.
nolan
took
a
long
time
re-writing
the
script
in
order
``
to
make
sure
that
the
emotional
journey
of
his
character
was
the
driving
force
of
the
movie
''
.

at

mountain
resort
began
in
late
november
2009
on
an
elaborate
set
on
top
of
a
mountain
.
the
production
had
to
wait
for
a
huge
snowstorm
which
eventually
arrived
.
the
film
was
shot
on
anamorphic
35mm
with
key
sequences
filmed
on
65mm
and
certain
other
sequences
with
vistavision
but
nolan
did
not
shoot
any
footage
with
imax
cameras
as
he
had
with
the
dark
knight
.
``
we
didnât
feel
that
we
were
going
to
be
able
to
shoot
in
imax
because
of
the
size
of
the
cameras
because
this
film
given
that
it
deals
with
a
potentially
surreal
area
the
nature
of
dreams
and
so
forth
i
wanted
it
to
be
as
realistic
as
possible
.
not
be
bound
by
the
scale
of
those
imax
cameras
even
though
i
love
the
format
dearly
.
''
nolan
also
chose
not
to
shoot
any
of
the
film
in
3-d
as
he
believes
that
shooting
on
digital
video
does
not
offer
a
high
enough
quality
image
.
special

expert
chris
corbould
and
his

scenes
where

chaotic
.
one
of
the
film
's
actors
joseph
gordon-levitt
spent
several
weeks
learning
to
fight
in
a
corridor
that
spun
like
``
a
giant
hamster
wheel
''
.
nolan
said
of
the
device
``
it
was
like
some
incredible
torture
device
we
thrashed
joseph
for
weeks
but
in
the
end
we
looked
at
the
footage
and
it
looks
unlike
anything
any
of
us
has
seen
before
.
the
rhythm
of
it
is
unique
and
when
you
watch
it
even
if
you
know
how
it
was
done
it
confuses
your
perceptions
.
it
's
unsettling
in
a
wonderful
way
''
.
gordon-levitt
remembered
``
it
was
six-day
weeks
of
just
like
coming
home
at
night
fuckin
'
battered
...
the
light
fixtures
on
the
ceiling
are
coming
around
on
the
floor
and
you
have
to
choose
the
right
time
to
cross
through
them
and
if
you
do
n't
you
're
going
to
fall
.
nolan
has
said
that
the
film
``
deals
with
levels
of
reality
and
perceptions
of
reality
which
is
something
i
'm
very
interested
in
.
it
's
an
action
film
set
in
a
contemporary
world
but
with
a
slight
science-fiction
bent
to
it
''
while
also
describing
it
as
``
very
much
an
ensemble
film
structured
somewhat
as
a
heist
movie
.
it
's
an
action
adventure
that
spans
the
globe
''
.
the
film
had
a
reported
budget
of
160
million
and
runs
for
approximately
148
minutes
