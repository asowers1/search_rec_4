20th
century
fox
has
officially
announced
that
james
cameron
has
decided
that
his
next
projects
will
be
the
to
put
it
mildly
highly-anticipated
sequels
avatar
2
and
avatar
3
.
cameron
announced
his
plans
last
week
to
shoot
the
avatar
sequels
back-to-back
but
said
he
was
still
uncertain
as
to
whether
he
would
take
on
another
project
before
returning
to
pandora
not
so
surprisingly
he
has
decided
to
do
the
latter
first
.
heres
the
official
word
from
fox
entertainment
chairmen
jim
gianopulos
and
tom
rothman
avatar
is
not
only
the
highest
grossing
movie
of
all
time
it
is
a
created
universe
based
on
the
singular
imagination
and
daring
ofâ
james
cameron
who
also
raised
the
consciousness
of
people
worldwide
to
some
of
the
greatest
issues
facing
our
planet
.
we
had
no
higher
priority
and
can
feel
no
greater
joy
than
enabling
jim
to
continue
and
expand
his
vision
of
the
world
of
avatar
.
cameron
spoke
out
about
the
avatar
sequels
as
well
saying
that
he
and
his
crews
goal
was
to
meet
and
exceed
the
global
audiences
expectations
for
the
richness
of
avatars
visual
world
and
that
both
avatar
2
and
avatar
3
would
not
back
off
the
throttle
of
avatars
visual
and
emotional
horsepower
and
will
continue
to
explore
its
themes
and
characters
which
touched
the
hearts
of
audiences
in
all
cultures
around
the
world
.
james
cameron
will
return
to
pandora
with
'avatar
2
and
3
'
.
avatar
grossed
over
2.8
billion
you
read
that
right
in
theaters
worldwide
and
was
very
well
liked
by
both
critics
and
casual
moviegoers
.
there
was
never
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
sequel
or
two
was
on
the
way
weve
all
just
been
waiting
to
hear
when
they
would
happen
.
both
avatar
2
and
avatar
3
will
be
less
expensive
shoots
since
cameron
and
his
crew
already
have
the
motion-capture
and
3d
camera
equipment
they
need
to
fully
realize
the
extra-terrestrial
world
populated
by
the
navi
.
avatar
stars
sam
worthington
and
zoe
saldana
will
definitely
be
back
for
the
sequels
and
theres
even
been
rumblings
about
how
both
stephen
lang
and
sigourney
weaver
could
reprise
their
roles
as
col.
quaritch
and
dr.
grace
augustine
respectively
.
were
not
sure
how
that
would
work
but
given
the
nature
of
the
avatar
universe
its
certainly
possible
.
jake
and
neytiri
will
be
back
in
the
'avatar
'
sequels
.
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
where
cameron
goes
in
terms
of
narrative
with
his
avatar
sequels
.
avatar
mixed
spectacular
sci-fi
action
and
creatures
with
a
not-so-subtle
allegorical
storyline
about
the
exploitation
of
natural
resources
and
genocide
against
a
native
population
sorry
folks
it
was
kind
of
like
ferngully
the
last
rainforest
meets
dances
with
wolves
.
well
see
if
the
plots
of
avatar
2
and
3
turn
out
to
be
a
little
less
clichã
and
heavy-handed
while
still
managing
to
address
the
important
social
issues
that
cameron
is
clearly
interested
in
.
cameron
will
work
on
the
scripts
for
the
avatar
sequels
early
next
year
with
an
eye
towards
starting
production
in
late
2011
.
avatar
2
is
tentatively
expected
to
reach
theaters
by
december
2014
while
avatar
3
will
aim
for
a
december
2015
release
date
.
