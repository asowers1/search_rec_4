the
eagle
has
landed
by
jack
higgins
the
original
novel
collins
1975
book
review
basis
for
the
1976
movie
after
an
unscheduled
but
necessary
donald
e.
westlake
interlude
necessary
because
it
allowed
me
to
finish
reading
the
novel
i
'm
about
to
discuss
let
's
have
the
final
book
which
begat
a
perhaps
more
famous
film
.
and
having
begun
this
series
of
posts
over
three
weeks
ago
now
with
a
world
war
ii-set
a
tale
with
an
``
eagle
''
in
its
title
of
a
daring
raid
by
a
squad
of
british
and
one
american
troops
i
'm
ending
it
with
a
world
war
ii-set
tale
with
an
``
eagle
''
in
its
title
of
a
daring
raid
by
a
squad
of
german
and
one
british
troops
.
moreover
seeing
as
this
is
the
grand
finale
of
this
series
for
which
i
'm
sure
by
this
point
we
're
all
immensely
grateful
i
've
managed
to
secure
a
copy
of
the
first
edition
of
the
novel
that
's
really
quite
remarkable
...
first
published
in
the
uk
by
collins
in
1975
under
a
dust
jacket
illustrated
by
barry
glynn
jack
higgins
's
the
eagle
has
landed
did
n't
have
long
to
wait
to
be
filmed
the
eponymous
movie
adaptation
directed
by
john
sturges
the
final
film
of
his
stellar
directing
career
highlights
including
the
great
escape
the
magnificent
seven
gunfight
at
the
ok
corral
and
one
of
my
favourite
movies
of
all
time
the
sort-of-sequel
to
gunfight
the
excellent
hour
of
the
gun
arrived
in
cinemas
the
following
year
starring
michael
caine
as
lieutenant-colonel
kurt
steiner
robert
duvall
as
colonel
radl
and
donald
sutherland
as
liam
devlin
.
like
where
eagles
dare
the
eagle
has
landed
is
one
of
those
terrific
war
films
i
'm
always
happy
to
watch
when
it
pops
up
on
telly
on
a
saturday
afternoon
.
it
's
perfectly
cast
caine
duvall
and
sutherland
all
brilliantly
personifying
their
respective
characters
plus
it
's
got
jenny
agutter
in
it
a
woman
who
holds
a
special
place
in
the
hearts
and
loins
of
men
of
a
certain
age
nicely
scripted
by
tom
mankiewicz
and
of
course
solidly
directed
by
sturges
.
but
the
best
thing
about
it
is
the
story
and
that
's
down
to
higgins
.
with
only
minor
differences
the
removal
of
a
character
and
subplot
or
two
in
the
film
both
book
and
movie
follow
the
same
trajectory
a
plan
is
hatched
by
himmler
to
either
kidnap
or
kill
british
prime
minister
winston
churchill
who
the
germans
learn
from
joanna
grey
a
spy
living
in
the
fictional
norfolk
village
of
studley
constable
will
be
staying
with
the
local
lord
of
the
manor
.
tasked
with
planning
and
carrying
out
this
mission
are
radl
steiner
along
with
what
remains
of
steiner
's
paratroop
assault
group
after
having
fought
on
the
eastern
front
and
then
being
assigned
in
disgrace
following
a
bust-up
with
the
ss
to
the
channel
islands
and
devlin
an
ira
man
resident
in
berlin
.
the
planning
actually
takes
up
two-thirds
of
the
novel
higgins
rattling
through
the
final
incursion
into
studley
constable
its
subsequent
collapse
after
one
of
the
german
paratroopers
rescues
two
kids
who
've
fallen
under
the
watermill
and
consequent
firefight
with
an
american
ranger
unit
at
a
breathless
pace
.
but
both
parts
of
the
book
are
splendidly
written
not
especially
stylishly
but
populated
with
memorable
well-drawn
characters
and
penned
with
the
gusto
of
an
author
who
knows
he
has
a
cracking
yarn
on
his
hands
.
that
said
a
yarn
is
n't
how
higgins
presents
the
tale
his
author
's
note
at
the
start
claims
that
``
at
least
fifty
per
cent
of
it
is
documented
historical
fact
''
while
a
framing
device
sees
higgins
himself
visiting
studley
constable
in
the
then-present
day
researching
a
magazine
article
and
inadvertently
uncovering
steiner
's
story
.
higgins
wrote
a
belated
sequel
to
the
eagle
has
landed
the
eagle
has
flown
1991
which
apparently
reveals
that
a
protagonist
who
dies
at
the
end
of
the
original
novel
in
fact
did
n't
i
've
got
a
copy
on
my
shelves
still
waiting
to
be
read
he
also
featured
liam
devlin
in
a
handful
of
other
novels
.
as
for
first
editions
of
the
eagle
has
landed
those
are
n't
exactly
scarce
abebooks
currently
has
around
fifty
listed
but
my
copy
is
unusual
in
that
it
bears
a
signed
jack
higgins
bookplate
i
know
of
only
one
other
signed
copy
of
the
eagle
has
landed
in
any
edition
another
collins
first
again
bearing
a
bookplate
and
offered
by
an
american
dealer
for
over
350
which
is
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
than
i
paid
for
mine
.
and
there
'll
be
more
signed
editions
on
existential
ennui
shortly
after
some
further
additions
to
beautiful
british
book
jacket
design
of
the
1950s
and

chris
the

would
be
a
fine
choice
for
a
follow-up
series
i
did
see
a
first
edition
of
that
at
the
last
lewes

fair
but
it
was
a
bit
pricey

donn
pearce
's
cool

luke
is
well
worth
reading
in
its

in
some
ways
i
liked
it
better
than
the
movie
and
i
really
love
the
movie.first
paperback
was
a
fawcett
gold
medal
i
believe
but
i
bet
you
there
is
a
british
1st
edition
with
a
beautiful
cover
.
and
seriously
even
though
his
writing
career
kinda
fizzled
out
pearce
's
bio
makes
him
sound
like

maybe

'm
amazed
no
one
has
mentioned
the
far
superior
1942
film
``
went
the
day
well
''
about
germann
paratroopers
taking
over
an
english
village
prior
to
a
nazi
invasion
.
a
film
memorable
for
thora
hird
's
proficiency
with
a
lee
enfield
rifle
.
it
was
based
on
a
graham
greene
story
which
i
've
never
been
able
to
track
down.as
for
the
book
the
eagle
has
landed
the
publishing
legend
is
that
jack
higgins
almost
pulled
out
of
his
contract
when
he
was
told
collins
only
planned
a
print
run
of
8000
copies
.
higgins
was
convinced
the
book
would
do
well

and
he
was
right.replydeletelouis
