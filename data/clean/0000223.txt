genetic
scientists
have
created
a

hired
for
an
additional
500000
to
adapt
the
novel
for
the
screen
.
david
koepp
wrote
the
final
draft
which
left
out
much
of
the
novel

exposition
and
violence

made
numerous
changes

jurassic
park
is
considered
by
many
to
be
one
of
the
greatest
films
of
the
1990s
and
in

cases

landmark
in

vector
of

park
called
jurassic

on
isla
nublar
a
tropical
island
in
an
isolated
central
american
location
populated
with
cloned
dinosaurs
.

is
killed
by

's
investors
represented
by
lawyer
donald

at
the

center
the
group
learns
during

laboratory
tour
that
the
cloning
was
accomplished
by
extracting
the
dna
of
dinosaurs
from
mosquitoes
that
had
been
preserved
in
amber
.
the
dna
strands
were
incomplete
so
dna
from
frogs
was
used
to
fill
in
the
gaps
.
the
dinosaurs
were
all
cloned
genetically
as
females
in
order
to
prevent
breeding

michael
crichton
's
book
attracted
the
attention
of
director
steven
spielberg
even
before
publishing
.
the
author
was
also
responsible
for
the
film
's
first
scripts
.
michael
crichton
originally
conceived
a
screenplay
about
a
graduate
student
who
recreates
a
dinosaur
he
continued
to
wrestle
with
his
fascination
with
dinosaurs
and
cloning
until
he
began
writing
the
novel
jurassic
park.3
even
before
publication
steven
spielberg
learned
of
the
novel
in
october
1989
while
he
and
crichton
were
discussing
a
screenplay
that
would
become
the
television
series
er.4
spielberg
considered
that
what
really
fascinated
him
was
that
jurassic
park
was
``
a
really
credible
look
at
how
dinosaurs
might
someday
be
brought
back
alongside
modern
mankind
''
going
beyond
a
simple
monster
movie.5
before
the
book
was
published
crichton
demanded
a
non-negotiable
fee
of
1.5
million
as

as

percentage
of

gave
a
green
light
to
the
film
on
the
condition
that
spielberg
made
jurassic

first.4
the
director
later
declared
that
by
choosing
a

thought
of
hiring
bob
gurr
who
designed
a
giant
mechanical
king
kong
for
universal
studios
hollywood
's
king
kong
encounter
.
upon
considering
that
the
life-sized
dinosaurs
would
be
too
expensive
and
not
all
convincing
spielberg
instead
decided
to
look
after
the
best
effects
supervisors
in
hollywood
.
brought
in
were
stan
winston
to
create
the
animatronic
dinosaurs
phil
tippett
to
create
go
motion
dinosaurs
for
long
shots
michael
lantieri
to
supervise
the
on-set
effects
and
dennis
muren
of
industrial
light
magic
to
do
the
digital
compositing
.
paleontologist
jack
horner
supervised
the
designs
to
help
fulfill
spielberg
's
desire
to
portray
the
dinosaurs
as
animals
rather
than
monsters
.
this
led
to
the
entry
of
certain
concepts
about
dinosaurs
such
as
the
theory
that
dinosaurs
evolved
into
birds
and
had
very
little
in
common
with
lizards
.
one
of
the
first
consequences
was
the
removal
of
the
raptors
'
flicking
tongues
in
tippett
's
early
animatics8
as
horner
complained
it
was
implausible.9
winston
's
department
created
fully
detailed
models
of
the
dinosaurs
before
molding
latex
skins
which
were
fitted
over
complex
robotics
.
tippett
created
stop-motion
animatics
of
both
the
raptors
in
the
kitchen
and
the
tyrannosaurus
attacking
the
car
.
but
despite
go
motion
's
attempts
at
motion
blurs
spielberg
still
found
the
end
results
unsatisfactory
in
terms
of
working
in
a
live-action
feature
film
.
muren
declared
to
spielberg
that
he
thought
the
dinosaurs
could
be
built
through
computer-generated
imagery
and
the
director
asked
him
to
prove
it.8
ilm
animators
mark
dippã
and
steve
williams
developed
a
computer-generated
walk
cycle
for
the
t.
rex
skeleton
and
were
approved
to
do
more.10
when
spielberg
and
tippett
saw
an
animatic
of
the
t.
rex
chasing
a
herd
of
gallimimus
spielberg
said
``
you
're
out
of
a
job
''
to
which
tippett
replied
``
do
n't
you
mean
extinct
''
8
spielberg
later
wrote
both
the
animatic
and
his
dialogue
between
him
and
tippett
into
the
script
as
a
conversation
between
malcolm
and
grant.11
although
no
go
motion
was
used
tippett
and
his
animators
were
still
used
by
the
production
to
supervise
dinosaur
movement
.
tippett
acted
as
a
consultant
regarding
dinosaur
anatomy
and
his
stop
motion
animators
were
re-trained
as
computer
animators.8
the
animatics
made
by
tippett
's
team
were
also
used
along
with
the
storyboards
as
a
reference
for
what
would
be
shot
during
the
action
sequences.12
ilm
's
artists
were
sent
to
private
tours
to
the
local
animal
park
so
they
could
study
large
animals
â
rhinos
elephants
alligators
and
giraffes
â
up
close
and
also
received
mime
classes
for
understanding
movements.13

universal
paid
crichton
a
further
500000
to
adapt
his
own
novel14
which
he
had
finished
by
the
time
spielberg
was
filming
hook
.
crichton
noted
that
because
the
book
was
``
fairly
long
''
his
script
only
had
about
10
to
20
percent
of
the
novel
's
content
scenes
were
dropped
for
budgetary
and
practical
reasons
and
despite
the
gory
descriptions
the
violence
was
toned
down.15

scotch
marmo
began
a
script
rewrite
in
october
1991
over
a
five-month
period
merging
ian
malcolm
with
alan
grant.16
as
spielberg
wanted
another
writer
to
rework
the
script
universal
president
casey
silver
recommended
him
david
koepp
co-writer
of
death
becomes
her.17
koepp
started
afresh
from
marmo
's
draft
and
used
spielberg
's
idea
of
a
cartoon
shown
to
the
visitors
to
remove
much
of
the
exposition
that
fills
crichton
's
novel.18
while
koepp
tried
to
avert
excessive
character
detail
``
because
whenever
they
started
talking
about
their
personal
lives
you
could
n't
care
less
''
19
he
tried
to
flesh
out
the
characters
and
make
for
a
more
colorful
cast
with
moments
such
as
malcolm
flirting
with
satler
leading
to

's
jealousy.5

characterizations
were

hammond
went
from
a
ruthless
businessman
to
a
kindly
old
man
because
spielberg
identified
with
hammond
's
obsession
with
showmanship.20
he
also
switched
the
characters
of
tim
and
lex
in
the
book
tim
is
aged
eleven
and
interested
in
computers
and
lex
is
only
seven
or
eight
and
interested
in
sports
.
spielberg
did
this
because
he
wanted
to
work
with
the
younger
joseph
mazzello
and
it
also
allowed
him
to
introduce
the
sub-plot
of
lex
's
adolescent
crush
on
grant.21
koepp
changed
grant
's
relationship
with
the
children
making
him
hostile
to
them
initially
to
allow
for
more
character
development.4
two
scenes
from
the
book
were
excised
with
spielberg
removing
the
opening
sequence
with
procompsognathus
attacking
young
children
as
he
found
it
too
horrific22
and
koepp
cutting
for
budgetary
reasons
the
t.
rex
chasing
grant
and
the
children
down
a
river
before
being
tranquilized
by
muldoon
.
both
parts
eventually
saw
inclusion
in
the
film
sequels.18
spielberg
suggested
the
addition
of
the
scene
where
the
t.
rex
pursues
a
jeep
which
at
first
would
only
have
the
characters
driving
away
after
listening
to
the
dinosaur
's
footsteps.23

months
of

filming
began
on
august
24
1992
on
the
hawaiian
island
of
kauaêi.24
while
costa
rica
was
considered
as
a
location
given
it
is
the

's
setting
spielberg
's
concerns
on
infrastructure
and
accessibility
made
him
choose
a
place
where
he
had
already
worked
before.5
the
three-week
shoot
involved
various
daytime
exteriors
for
isla
nublar
's
forests.6
on
september
11
hurricane
iniki
passed
directly
over
kauaêi
which
caused
the
crew
to
lose
a
day
of
shooting.25
several
of
the
storm
scenes
from
the
movie
are
actual
footage
shot
during

hurricane
.
the
scheduled
shoot
of
the
gallimimus
chase
was
moved
to
kualoa
ranch
on
the
island
of
oahu
and
one
of
the
beginning
scenes
had
to
be
created
by
digitally
animating
a
still
shot
of
scenery.11
the
opening
scene
was
shot
in

on
the

with
additional

being
filmed
on
the
``

moved
back
to

to
shoot
the

of
the
universal
studio
lot.6
given
the
kitchen
set
was
filled
with
reflective
surfaces
cinematographer
dean
cundey
had
to
carefully
plan
the
illumination
while
also
using
black
cloths
to
hide
the
light
reflections.12
the
crew
also
shot
on

23
for
the
scenes
involving
the
power
supply
before
going
on

to
red
rock

for

the

using
a
fifty-foot
prop
with
hydraulic
wheels
for
the
car
fall
and
the
brachiosaurus

.
the
crew
filmed
scenes
for
the

which
used

spielberg
got
a
deal
with
the
ford
motor
company
who
provided
seven
ford
explorers.3031
the
explorers
were
modified
by
ilm
's
crew
and
veteran
customizer
george
barris
to
create
the
illusion
that
they
were
autonomous
cars
by
hiding
the

in

also
customized

the
crew
moved
to
warner
bros.
studios
'
stage
16
to
shoot
the
t.
rexâ'âs
attack
on
the
suvs.29
shooting
proved
frustrating
due
to
water
soaking
the
foam
rubber
skin
of
the
animatronic
dinosaur
which
caused
the
animatronic
t.
rex
to
shake
and
quiver
from
the
extra
weight
when
the
foam
absorbed
the
water
.
this
forced
stan
winston
's
crew
to
dry
the
model
with
shammys
between
takes.34
on
the
set
malcolm
distracting
the
dinosaur

was
included
at
jeff
goldblum
's
suggestion
as
he
felt
a
heroic
action
was
better
than
going
by
the
script
where
like
gennaro
malcolm
would
get
scared
and
run
away.12
the
ripples
in
the
glass
of
water
caused
by
the
t.
rexâ'âs
footsteps
was
inspired
by
spielberg
listening
to
earth
wind
and
fire
in
his
car
and
the
vibrations
the
bass
rhythm
caused
.
lantieri
was
unsure
of
how
to
create
the
shot
until
the
night
before
filming
when
he
put
a
glass
of
water
on
a
guitar
he
was
playing
which
achieved
the
concentric
circles
in
the
water
spielberg
wanted
.
the
next
morning
guitar
strings
were
put
inside
the
car
and
a
man
on
the
floor
plucked
the
strings
to
achieve
the
effect.35
back
at

the
crew
filmed
scenes
with
the
dilophosaurus
on
stage
27
.
finally
the
shoot
finished
on

12
with
the
climactic
chases
with
the
raptors
in
the
park
's
computer
rooms
and
visitor
's
center.36
spielberg
changed
the
climax
to
bring
back
the
t.

abandoning
the
original
ending
in
which
grant
uses
a
platform
machine
to
maneuver
a
raptor
into
a
fossil
tyrannosaur
's
jaws.37
the
scene
which
already
had
the
juxtaposition
of
live
dinosaurs
in
a
museum
filled
with
fossils
while
also
destroying
the
bones
now
also
had
an
ending
where
the
t.
rex
saved
the
protagonists
and
afterwards
did
what
spielberg
described
as
a
``
king
kong
roar
''
while
an
ironic
banner
reading
``

even
leading
him
to

.52
while
the
consulting
paleontologists
did
not
have
a
consensus
on
the
dinosaur
's
movement
particularly
regarding
its
running
capabilities
animator
steve
williams
decided
to
``
throw
physics
out

window

create
a
t.

that
moved
at
sixty
miles
per

even
though
its
hollow
bones
would
have
busted
if
it
ran
that
fast
''
.53
the
major
reason
was
the
t.
rex
chasing
a
jeep
a
scene
that
took
two
months
to
finish.45
the
dinosaur
is
depicted
with
a
vision
system
based
on
movement
though
later
studies
indicated
the
t.
rex
had
binocular
vision
comparable
to
a
bird
of
prey.54
its
roar
is
a
baby
elephant
mixed
with
a
tiger
and
an
alligator
and
its
breath
is
a
whale
's
blow.45
a

for
the

tearing

gallimimus
apart8
while

sequoias
crashing

became
the
sound
of
the
dinosaur
's
footsteps.12
velociraptor
has
a
major
role
and
it
is
also
the
main
villain
.
the
animal
's
depiction
was
not
based
on
the
actual
dinosaur
genus
in
question
which
itself
was
significantly
smaller
.
coincidentally
shortly55
before
jurassic

's
theatre
release
the
similar
utahraptor
was
discovered
though
was
proven
bigger
in
appearance
than
the
film
's
raptors
this
prompted
stan

to
joke
``

had
feathers
.
this

is
only
included
in

iii
for

dilophosaurus
was
also
very
different
from
its
real-life
counterpart
made
significantly
smaller
to
make
sure
audiences
did
not
confuse
it
with
the
raptors.58
its
neck
frill
and
its
ability
to
spit
venom
are
fictitious
.
its
vocal
sounds
were
made
by
combining
a
swan
a
hawk
a
howler
monkey
and
a
rattlesnake.8
the
animatronic
model
nicknamed
``
spitter
''
by
stan
winston
's
team
was
animated
by
the
puppeteers
sitting
on
a
trench
in
the
set
floor
and
used
a
paintball
mechanism
to
spit
the
mixture
of
methacyl
and
k-y
jelly
that
served
as
venom.59
brachiosaurus
is
the
first
dinosaur
seen
by
the
park
's
visitors
.
it
is
inaccurately
depicted
as
chewing
its
food
and
standing
up
on
its
hind
legs
to
browse
among
the
high
tree
branches.45
according
to
artist
andy
schoneberg
the
chewing
was
done
to
make
the
animal
seem
docile
in
a
way
it
resembled
a
cow
chewing
its
cud
.
the
dinosaur
's
head
and

neck
was
the

built
for

despite
scientific
evidence
of

capabilities
sound
designer
gary
rydstrom
decided
to
represent

to
give

logistical
nightmare

the
gallimimus

then
fully

pursued
by

its
design
was
based
on
ostriches

mostly
on
the
