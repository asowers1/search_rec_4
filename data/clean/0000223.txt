hired
for
an
additional
500000
to
adapt
the
novel
for
the

.
david
koepp
wrote
the
final
draft
which
left
out
much
of
the

to
be
one
of
the
greatest
films

called
jurassic

on
isla
nublar
a
tropical

in
an
isolated
central
american
location
populated
with
cloned

represented
by

at

the
group
learns
during

laboratory
tour
that
the
cloning
was
accomplished
by
extracting
the
dna
of
dinosaurs
from
mosquitoes
that
had
been
preserved
in
amber
.
the
dna
strands
were
incomplete
so
dna
from
frogs
was
used
to
fill
in
the
gaps
.
the
dinosaurs
were
all
cloned
genetically
as
females
in

to
prevent
breeding

michael
crichton
's
book
attracted
the
attention
of
director
steven
spielberg
even
before
publishing
.
the
author
was
also
responsible
for
the
film
's
first
scripts
.
michael
crichton
originally
conceived
a
screenplay
about
a
graduate
student
who
recreates
a
dinosaur
he
continued
to
wrestle
with
his
fascination
with
dinosaurs
and
cloning
until
he
began
writing
the
novel
jurassic
park.3
even
before
publication
steven
spielberg
learned
of
the
novel
in
october
1989
while
he
and
crichton
were
discussing
a
screenplay
that
would
become
the
television
series
er.4
spielberg
considered
that
what
really
fascinated
him
was
that
jurassic
park
was
``
a
really
credible
look
at
how
dinosaurs
might
someday
be
brought
back
alongside
modern
mankind
''
going
beyond
a
simple
monster
movie.5
before
the
book
was
published
crichton
demanded
a
non-negotiable
fee
of
1.5
million
as

as

gave
a
green
light
to
the
film
on
the
condition
that

made

the
director
later
declared
that
by
choosing

thought
of
hiring
bob
gurr
who
designed
a
giant
mechanical
king
kong
for
universal
studios
hollywood
's
king
kong
encounter
.
upon
considering
that
the
life-sized
dinosaurs
would
be
too
expensive
and
not
all
convincing
spielberg
instead
decided
to
look
after
the
best
effects
supervisors
in
hollywood
.
brought
in
were
stan
winston
to
create
the
animatronic
dinosaurs
phil
tippett
to
create
go
motion
dinosaurs
for
long
shots
michael
lantieri
to
supervise
the
on-set
effects
and
dennis
muren
of
industrial
light
magic
to
do
the
digital
compositing
.
paleontologist
jack
horner
supervised
the
designs
to
help
fulfill
spielberg
's
desire
to
portray
the
dinosaurs
as
animals
rather
than
monsters
.
this
led
to
the
entry
of
certain
concepts
about
dinosaurs
such
as
the
theory
that
dinosaurs
evolved
into
birds
and
had
very
little
in
common
with
lizards
.
one
of
the
first
consequences
was
the
removal
of
the
raptors
'
flicking
tongues
in
tippett
's
early
animatics8
as
horner
complained
it
was
implausible.9
winston
's
department
created
fully
detailed
models
of
the
dinosaurs
before
molding
latex
skins
which
were
fitted
over
complex
robotics
.
tippett
created
stop-motion
animatics
of
both
the
raptors
in
the
kitchen
and
the
tyrannosaurus
attacking
the
car
.
but
despite
go
motion
's
attempts
at
motion
blurs
spielberg
still
found
the
end
results
unsatisfactory
in
terms
of
working
in
a
live-action
feature
film
.
muren
declared
to
spielberg
that
he
thought
the
dinosaurs
could
be
built
through
computer-generated
imagery
and
the
director
asked
him
to
prove
it.8
ilm
animators
mark
dipp√£
and
steve
williams
developed
a
computer-generated
walk
cycle
for
the
t.
rex
skeleton
and
were
approved
to
do
more.10
when
spielberg
and
tippett
saw
an
animatic
of
the
t.
rex
chasing
a
herd
of
gallimimus
spielberg
said
``
you
're
out
of
a
job
''
to
which
tippett
replied
``
do
n't
you
mean
extinct
''
8
spielberg
later
wrote
both
the
animatic
and
his
dialogue
between
him
and
tippett
into
the
script
as
a
conversation
between
malcolm
and
grant.11
although
no
go
motion
was
used
tippett
and
his
animators
were
still
used
by
the
production
to
supervise
dinosaur
movement
.
tippett
acted
as
a
consultant
regarding
dinosaur
anatomy
and
his
stop
motion
animators
were
re-trained
as
computer
animators.8
the
animatics
made
by
tippett
's
team
were
also
used
along
with
the
storyboards
as
a
reference
for
what
would
be
shot
during
the
action
sequences.12
ilm
's
artists
were
sent
to
private
tours
to
the
local
animal
park
so
they
could
study
large
animals
√¢
rhinos
elephants
alligators
and
giraffes
√¢
up
close
and
also
received
mime
classes
for
understanding

universal
paid
crichton
a
further
500000
to
adapt
his
own
novel14
which
he
had
finished
by
the
time
spielberg
was
filming
hook
.
crichton
noted
that
because
the
book
was
``
fairly
long
''
his
script
only
had
about
10
to
20
percent
of
the
novel
's
content
scenes
were
dropped
for
budgetary
and
practical
reasons
and
despite
the
gory
descriptions
the
violence
was
toned
down.15
malia
scotch
marmo
began
a
script
rewrite
in
october
1991
over
a
five-month
period
merging
ian
malcolm
with
alan
grant.16
as
spielberg
wanted
another
writer
to
rework
the
script
universal
president
casey
silver
recommended
him
david
koepp
co-writer
of
death
becomes
her.17
koepp
started
afresh
from
marmo
's
draft
and
used
spielberg
's
idea
of
a
cartoon
shown
to
the
visitors
to
remove
much
of
the
exposition
that
fills
crichton
's
novel.18
while
koepp
tried
to
avert
excessive
character
detail
``
because
whenever
they
started
talking
about
their
personal
lives
you
could
n't
care
less
''
19
he
tried
to
flesh
out
the
characters
and
make
for
a
more
colorful
cast
with
moments
such
as
malcolm
flirting
with
satler
leading
to
grant
's
jealousy.5
some
characterizations
were
changed

.
hammond
went
from
a
ruthless
businessman
to
a
kindly
old
man
because
spielberg
identified
with
hammond
's
obsession
with
showmanship.20
he
also
switched
the
characters
of
tim
and
lex
in
the
book
tim
is
aged
eleven
and
interested
in
computers
and
lex
is
only
seven
or
eight
and
interested
in
sports
.
spielberg
did
this
because
he
wanted
to
work
with
the
younger
joseph
mazzello
and
it
also
allowed
him
to
introduce
the
sub-plot
of
lex
's
adolescent
crush
on
grant.21
koepp
changed
grant
's
relationship
with
the
children
making
him
hostile
to
them
initially
to
allow
for
more
character
development.4
two
scenes
from
the
book
were
excised
with
spielberg
removing
the
opening
sequence
with
procompsognathus
attacking
young
children
as
he
found
it
too
horrific22
and
koepp
cutting
for
budgetary
reasons
the
t.
rex
chasing
grant
and
the
children
down
a
river
before
being
tranquilized
by
muldoon
.
both
parts
eventually
saw
inclusion
in
the
film
sequels.18
spielberg
suggested
the
addition
of
the
scene
where
the
t.
rex
pursues
a
jeep
which
at
first
would
only
have
the
characters
driving
away
after
listening
to

spielberg
's
concerns
on

made
him
choose

the

on

hurricane

passed
directly
over

one
of

the

were
modified
by

create
the

to
shoot
the

on

shooting
proved
frustrating
due
to
water
soaking
the
foam
rubber
skin
of
the
animatronic
dinosaur
which
caused
the
animatronic
t.
rex
to
shake
and
quiver
from
the
extra
weight
when
the
foam
absorbed
the
water
.
this
forced

dry
the

better
than

the

was
inspired
by

caused

lantieri
was
unsure
of
how
to
create
the
shot
until
the
night
before
filming
when
he
put
a
glass
of
water
on
a
guitar
he
was
playing
which
achieved
the
concentric

wanted

the
next
morning

were
put

had
the

destroying

now
also
had
an
ending

saved

afterwards
did

described

consulting
paleontologists
did
not
have
a
consensus
on

's

regarding
its
running
capabilities
animator
steve

decided
to
``
throw

though

would
have
busted
if
it

.53
the
major
reason
was
the
t.
rex
chasing
a
jeep
a
scene
that
took
two
months
to
finish.45
the
dinosaur
is
depicted
with
a
vision
system
based
on
movement
though
later
studies
indicated
the
t.
rex
had
binocular
vision
comparable
to
a
bird
of
prey.54
its
roar
is
a
baby
elephant
mixed
with
a
tiger

its

velociraptor
has
a
major
role
and
it
is
also
the
main
villain
.
the
animal
's
depiction
was
not
based
on
the
actual
dinosaur
genus
in
question
which
itself
was
significantly
smaller
.
coincidentally
shortly55
before

the
similar
utahraptor
was
discovered

was

very
different

its

its
vocal

were
made
by
combining

and
a
rattlesnake.8
the
animatronic

by

was
animated
by
the
puppeteers

mechanism
to
spit

brachiosaurus
is
the
first
dinosaur
seen
by

it
is
inaccurately
depicted
as
chewing

standing
up
on
its
hind
legs
to
browse
among
the
high
tree
branches.45
according
to
artist
andy
schoneberg
the
chewing
was
done
to
make
the
animal
seem
docile
in
a
way
it
resembled
a

chewing

cud
.
the
