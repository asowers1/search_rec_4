when
he
argues
with

and
accidentally
gives

struggle
with
an
anglerfish
in

directions
to
sydney
from
a
school
of
moonfish
marlin
and
dory
encounter
a
bloom
of
jellyfish

nearly
kills

consciousness
and
wakes
up
to
a
sea
turtle
named
crush
who
takes
marlin
and
dory
on
the
east
australian
current
.
marlin
tell
the
details
of
his
long
journey
with
a
group
of
sea
turtles
and
his
story
is
spread
across
the
ocean
.
he
also
sees
how
crush
gets
on
well
with
his
son
squirt
.
meanwhile
nemo
is
placed
in
a
fish
tank
in
the
office
of
a
dentist
named
phillip
sherman
on
sydney
harbour
.
he
meets
aquarium
fish
called
the
tank
gang
led
by
a
moorish
idol
named
gill
who
has
a
broken
fin
.
the
tank

is
to
be
given
to
sherman
's
niece
darla
who
killed
a
fish
by
constantly
shaking
its
bag
.
gill
then
reveals
his
plan
to
escape
jamming
the
tank
's
filter
forcing
the
dentist
to
remove
the
fish
to
clean
it
.
the
fish
would
be
placed
in
plastic
bags
and
then
they
would
roll
out
the
window
and
into
the
harbor
.
after
an
attempt
at
the
escape
goes
wrong
a
brown
pelican
nigel
brings
news
of
marlin
's
adventure
.
inspired
by
his
father
's
determination
nemo
successfully
jams
the
filter
but
the
dentist
installs
a
new
high-tech
filter
before
they
can
escape
.
after
leaving
the
east
australian
current
marlin
and
dory
are
engulfed
by
a
whale
.
inside
the
whale
's
mouth
dory
communicates
with
the
whale
which
carries
them
to
port
jackson
and
expels
them
through
his
blowhole
.
they
meet
nigel
who
recognizes
marlin
from
the
stories
he
has
heard
and
he
takes
them
to
sherman
's
office
.
darla
has
just
arrived
and
the
dentist
is
handing
nemo
to
her
.
nemo
plays
dead
to
save
himself
as
nigel
arrives
.
marlin
sees
nemo
and
believes
he
is
dead
.
in
despair
marlin
leaves
dory
and
begins
to
swim
home
.
gill
then
helps
nemo
escape
into
a
drain
that
leads
to
the
ocean
.
dory
loses
her
memory
and
becomes
confused
and
meets
nemo
who
reached
the
ocean
.
eventually
dory
's
memory
is
restored
after
reading
the
word
``
sydney
''
on
a
drainpipe
.
she
directs
nemo
to
marlin
and
they
reunite
but
then
dory
is
caught
in
a
fishing
net
with
a
school
of
grouper
.
nemo
enters
the
net
and
orders
the
group
to
swim
downward
to
break
the
net
enabling
them
to
escape
.
after
returning
home
nemo
leaves
for
school
with
crush
's
son
squirt
and
marlin
no
longer
overprotective
proudly
watches
nemo
swim
away
with
dory
at
his
side
.
at
the
dentist
's
office
the
high-tech
filter
breaks
down
and

productionedit
the
inspiration
for
nemo
sprang
from
multiple
experiences
going
back
to
when
director
andrew
stanton
was
a
child
when
he
loved
going
to
the
dentist
to
see
the
fish
tank
assuming
that
the
fish
were
from
the
ocean
and
wanted
to
go
home.5
in
1992
shortly
after
his
son
was
born
he
and
his
family
took
a
trip
to
six
flags
discovery
kingdom
which
was
called
marine
world
at
the
time
.
there
after
seeing
the
shark
tube
and
various
exhibits
he
felt
that
the
underwater
world
could
be
done
beautifully
in
computer
animation.6
later
in
1997
he
took
his
son
for
a
walk
in
the
park
but
realized
that
he
was
over
protecting
him
and
lost
an
opportunity
to
have
a
father-son
experience
that
day.5
in
an
interview
with
national
geographic
magazine
he
said
that
the
idea
for
the
characters
of
marlin
and
nemo
came
from
a
photograph
of
two
clownfish
peeking
out
of
an
anemone
â
it
was
so
arresting
.
i
had
no
idea
what
kind
of
fish
they
were
but
i
could
n't
take
my
eyes
off
them
.
and
as
an
entertainer
the
fact
that
they
were
called
clownfishâit
was
perfect
.
there
's
almost
nothing
more
appealing
than
these
little
fish
that
want
to
play
peekaboo
with
you.7
â
in
addition
clownfish
are
colourful
but
do
not
tend
to
come
out
of
an
anemone
often
.
for
a
character
who
has
to
go
on
a
dangerous
journey
stanton
felt
a
clownfish
was
the
perfect
type
of
fish
for
the
character.5
pre-production
of
the
film
began
in
early
1997
.
stanton
began
writing
the
screenplay
during
the
post-production
of
a
bug
's
life
.
as
a
result
finding
nemo
began
production
with
a
complete
screenplay
something
that
co-director
lee
unkrich
called
``
very
unusual
for
an
animated
film
''
.5
the
artists
took
scuba
diving
lessons
to
study
the
coral
reef.5
andrew
stanton
co-wrote
and
directed
the
film
.
the
idea
for
the
initiation
sequence
came
from
a
story
conference
between
andrew
stanton
and
bob
peterson
while
they
were
driving
to
record
the
actors
.
ellen
degeneres
was
cast
after
stanton
watched
ellen
with
his
wife
and
saw
ellen
``
change
the
subject
five
times
before
finishing
one
sentence
''
.5
the
pelican
character
named
gerald
who
in
the
final
film
ends
up
swallowing
and
choking
on
marlin
and
dory
was
originally
a
friend
of
nigel
.
they
were
going
to
play
against
each
other
with
nigel
being
neat
and
fastidious
and
gerald
being
scruffy
and
sloppy
.
the
filmmakers
could
not
find
an
appropriate
scene
for
them
that
did
not
slow
the
pace
of
the
picture
so
gerald
's
character
was
minimized.5
stanton
himself
provided
the
voice
of
crush
the
sea
turtle
.
he
originally
did
the
voice
for
the
film
's
story
reel
and
assumed
they
would
find
an
actor
later
.
when
stanton
's
performance
became
popular
in
test
screenings
he
decided
to
keep
his
performance
in
the
film
.
he
recorded
all
his
dialogue
while
lying
on
a
sofa
in
co-director
lee
unkrich
's
office.5
crush
's
son
squirt
was
voiced
by
nicholas
bird
the
young
son
of
fellow
pixar
director
brad
bird
.
according
to
stanton
the
elder
bird
was
playing
a
tape
recording
of
his
young
son
around
the
pixar
studios
one
day
.
stanton
felt
the
voice
was
``
this
generation
's
thumper
''
and
immediately
cast
nicholas.5
megan
mullally
was
originally
going
to
provide
a
voice
in
the
film
.
according
to
mullally
the
producers
were
dissatisfied
to
learn
that
the
voice
of
her
character
karen
walker
on
the
television
show
will
grace
was
not
her
natural
speaking
voice
.
the
producers
hired
her
anyway
and
then
strongly
encouraged
her
to
use
her
karen
walker
voice
for
the
role
.
when
mullally
refused
she
was
dismissed.8
to
ensure
that
the
movements
of
the
fish
in
the
film
were
believable
the
animators
took
a
crash
course
in
fish
biology
and
oceanography
.
they
visited
aquariums
went
diving
in
hawaii
and
received
in-house
lectures
from
an
ichthyologist.9
as
a
result
pixar
's
animator
for
dory
gini
cruz
santos
integrated
``
the
fish
movement
human
movement
and
facial
expressions
to
make
them
look
and
feel
like
real
characters
