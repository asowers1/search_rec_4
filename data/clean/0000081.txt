excerpt
chapter
1
in
the
fall
of
1995
after
resigning
from
my
last
academic
post
i
decided
to
indulge
myself
and
fulfill
a
dream
.
i
chose
seven
of
my
best
and
most
committed
students
and
invited
them
to
come
to
my
home
every
thursday
morning
to
discuss
literature
.
they
were
all
women-to
teach
a
mixed
class
in
the
privacy
of
my
home
was
too
risky
even
if
we
were
discussing
harmless
works
of
fiction
.
one
persistent
male
student
although
barred
from
our
class
insisted
on
his
rights
.
so
he
nima
read
the
assigned
material
and
on
special
days
he
would
come
to
my
house
to
talk
about
the
books
we
were
reading
.
i
often
teasingly
reminded
my
students
of
muriel
sparks
the
prime
of
miss
jean
brodie
and
asked
which
one
of
you
will
finally
betray
me
for
i
am
a
pessimist
by
nature
and
i
was
sure
at
least
one
would
turn
against
me
.
nassrin
once
responded
mischievously
you
yourself
told
us
that
in
the
final
analysis
we
are
our
own
betrayers
playing
judas
to
our
own
christ
.
manna
pointed
out
that
i
was
no
miss
brodie
and
they
well
they
were
what
they
were
.
she
reminded
me
of
a
warning
i
was
fond
of
repeating
do
not
under
any
circumstances
belittle
a
work
of
fiction
by
trying
to
turn
it
into
a
carbon
copy
of
real
life
what
we
search
for
in
fiction
is
not
so
much
reality
but
the
epiphany
of
truth
.
yet
i
suppose
that
if
i
were
to
go
against
my
own
recommendation
and
choose
a
work
of
fiction
that
would
most
resonate
with
our
lives
in
the
islamic
republic
of
iran
it
would
not
be
the
prime
of
miss
jean
brodie
or
even
1984
but
perhaps
nabokovs
invitation
to
a
beheading
or
better
yet
lolita
.
a
couple
of
years
after
we
had
begun
our
thursday-morning
seminars
on
the
last
night
i
was
in
tehran
a
few
friends
and
students
came
to
say
good-bye
and
to
help
me
pack
.
when
we
had
deprived
the
house
of
all
its
items
when
the
objects
had
vanished
and
the
colors
had
faded
into
eight
gray
suitcases
like
errant
genies
evaporating
into
their
bottles
my
students
and
i
stood
against
the
bare
white
wall
of
the
dining
room
and
took
two
photographs
.
i
have
the
two
photographs
in
front
of
me
now
.
in
the
first
there
are
seven
women
standing
against
a
white
wall
.
they
are
according
to
the
law
of
the
land
dressed
in
black
robes
and
head
scarves
covered
except
for
the
oval
of
their
faces
and
their
hands
.
in
the
second
photograph
the
same
group
in
the
same
position
stands
against
the
same
wall
.
only
they
have
taken
off
their
coverings
.
splashes
of
color
separate
one
from
the
next
.
each
has
become
distinct
through
the
color
and
style
of
her
clothes
the
color
and
the
length
of
her
hair
not
even
the
two
who
are
still
wearing
their
head
scarves
look
the
same
.
the
one
to
the
far
right
in
the
second
photograph
is
our
poet
manna
in
a
white
t-shirt
and
jeans
.
she
made
poetry
out
of
things
most
people
cast
aside
.
the
photograph
does
not
reflect
the
peculiar
opacity
of
mannas
dark
eyes
a
testament
to
her
withdrawn
and
private
nature
.
next
to
manna
is
mahshid
whose
long
black
scarf
clashes
with
her
delicate
features
and
retreating
smile
.
mahshid
was
good
at
many
things
but
she
had
a
certain
daintiness
about
her
and
we
took
to
calling
her
my
lady
.
nassrin
used
to
say
that
more
than
defining
mahshid
we
had
managed
to
add
another
dimension
to
the
word
lady
.
mahshid
is
very
sensitive
.
shes
like
porcelain
yassi
once
told
me
easy
to
crack
.
thats
why
she
appears
fragile
to
those
who
dont
know
her
too
well
but
woe
to
whoever
offends
her
.
as
for
me
yassi
continued
good-naturedly
im
like
good
old
plastic
i
wont
crack
no
matter
what
you
do
with
me
.
yassi
was
the
youngest
in
our
group
.
she
is
the
one
in
yellow
bending
forward
and
bursting
with
laughter
.
we
used
to
teasingly
call
her
our
comedian
.
yassi
was
shy
by
nature
but
certain
things
excited
her
and
made
her
lose
her
inhibitions
.
she
had
a
tone
of
voice
that
gently
mocked
and
questioned
not
just
others
but
herself
as
well
.
i
am
the
one
in
brown
standing
next
to
yassi
with
one
arm
around
her
shoulders
.
directly
behind
me
stands
azin
my
tallest
student
with
her
long
blond
hair
and
a
pink
t-shirt
.
she
is
laughing
like
the
rest
of
us
.
azins
smiles
never
looked
like
smiles
they
appeared
more
like
preludes
to
an
irrepressible
and
nervous
hilarity
.
she
beamed
in
that
peculiar
fashion
even
when
she
was
describing
her
latest
trouble
with
her
husband
.
always
outrageous
and
outspoken
azin
relished
the
shock
value
of
her
actions
and
comments
and
often
clashed
with
mahshid
and
manna
.
we
nicknamed
her
the
wild
one
.
on
my
other
side
is
mitra
who
was
perhaps
the
calmest
among
us
.
like
the
pastel
colors
of
her
paintings
she
seemed
to
recede
and
fade
into
a
paler
register
.
her
beauty
was
saved
from
predictability
by
a
pair
of
miraculous
dimples
which
she
could
and
did
use
to
manipulate
many
an
unsuspecting
victim
into
bending
to
her
will
.
sanaz
who
pressured
by
family
and
society
vacillated
between
her
desire
for
independence
and
her
need
for
approval
is
holding
on
to
mitras
arm
.
we
are
all
laughing
.
and
nima
mannas
husband
and
my
one
true
literary
critic-if
only
he
had
had
the
perseverance
to
finish
the
brilliant
essays
he
started
to
write-is
our
invisible
partner
the
photographer
.
there
was
one
more
nassrin
.
she
is
not
in
the
photographs-she
didnt
make
it
to
the
end
.
yet
my
tale
would
be
incomplete
without
those
who
could
not
or
did
not
remain
with
us
.
their
absences
persist
like
an
acute
pain
that
seems
to
have
no
physical
source
.
this
is
tehran
for
me
its
absences
were
more
real
than
its
presences
.
when
i
see
nassrin
in
my
minds
eye
shes
slightly
out
of
focus
blurred
somehow
distant
.
ive
combed
through
the
photographs
my
students
took
with
me
over
the
years
and
nassrin
is
in
many
of
them
but
always
hidden
behind
something-a
person
a
tree
.
in
one
i
am
standing
with
eight
of
my
students
in
the
small
garden
facing
our
faculty
building
the
scene
of
so
many
farewell
photographs
over
the
years
.
in
the
background
stands
a
sheltering
willow
tree
.
we
are
laughing
and
in
one
corner
from
behind
the
tallest
student
nassrin
peers
out
like
an
imp
intruding
roguishly
on
a
scene
it
was
not
invited
to
.
in
another
i
can
barely
make
out
her
face
in
the
small
v
space
behind
two
other
girls
shoulders
.
in
this
one
she
looks
absentminded
she
is
frowning
as
if
unaware
that
she
is
being
photographed
.
how
can
i
describe
nassrin
i
once
called
her
the
cheshire
cat
appearing
and
disappearing
at
unexpected
turns
in
my
academic
life
.
the
truth
is
i
cant
describe
her
she
was
her
own
definition
.
one
can
only
say
that
nassrin
was
nassrin
.
for
nearly
two
years
almost
every
thursday
morning
rain
or
shine
they
came
to
my
house
and
almost
every
time
i
could
not
get
over
the
shock
of
seeing
them
shed
their
mandatory
veils
and
robes
and
burst
into
color
.
when
my
students
came
into
that
room
they
took
off
more
than
their
scarves
and
robes
.
gradually
each
one
gained
an
outline
and
a
shape
becoming
her
own
inimitable
self
.
our
world
in
that
living
room
with
its
window
framing
my
beloved
elburz
mountains
became
our
sanctuary
our
self-contained
universe
mocking
the
reality
of
black-scarved
timid
faces
in
the
city
that
sprawled
below
.
the
theme
of
the
class
was
the
relation
between
fiction
and
reality
.
we
read
persian
classical
literature
such
as
the
tales
of
our
own
lady
of
fiction
scheherazade
from
a
thousand
and
one
nights
along
with
western
classics-pride
and
prejudice
madame
bovary
daisy
miller
the
deans
december
and
yes
lolita
.
as
i
write
the
title
of
each
book
memories
whirl
in
with
the
wind
to
disturb
the
quiet
of
this
fall
day
in
another
room
in
another
country
.
here
and
now
in
that
other
world
that
cropped
up
so
many
times
in
our
discussions
i
sit
and
reimagine
myself
and
my
students
my
girls
as
i
came
to
call
them
reading
lolita
in
a
deceptively
sunny
room
in
tehran
.
but
to
steal
the
words
from
humbert
the
poetcriminal
of
lolita
i
need
you
the
reader
to
imagine
us
for
we
wont
really
exist
if
you
dont
.
against
the
tyranny
of
time
and
politics
imagine
us
the
way
we
sometimes
didnt
dare
to
imagine
ourselves
in
our
most
private
and
secret
moments
in
the
most
extraordinarily
ordinary
instances
of
life
listening
to
music
falling
in
love
walking
down
the
shady
streets
or
reading
lolita
in
tehran
.
and
then
imagine
us
again
with
all
this
confiscated
driven
underground
taken
away
from
us
.
if
i
write
about
nabokov
today
it
is
to
celebrate
our
reading
of
nabokov
in
tehran
against
all
odds
.
of
all
his
novels
i
choose
the
one
i
taught
last
and
the
one
that
is
connected
to
so
many
memories
.
it
is
of
lolita
that
i
want
to
write
but
right
now
there
is
no
way
i
can
write
about
that
novel
without
also
writing
about
tehran
.
this
then
is
the
story
of
lolita
in
tehran
how
lolita
gave
a
different
color
to
tehran
and
how
tehran
helped
redefine
nabokovs
novel
turning
it
into
this
lolita
our
lolita
.
2
and
so
it
happened
that
one
thursday
in
early
september
we
gathered
in
my
living
room
for
our
first
meeting
.
here
they
come
one
more
time
.
first
i
hear
the
bell
a
pause
and
the
closing
of
the
street
door
.
then
i
hear
footsteps
coming
up
the
winding
staircase
and
past
my
mothers
apartment
.
as
i
move
towards
the
front
door
i
register
a
piece
of
sky
through
the
side
window
.
each
girl
as
soon
as
she
reaches
the
door
takes
off
her
robe
and
scarf
sometimes
shaking
her
head
from
side
to
side
.
she
pauses
before
entering
the
room
.
only
there
is
no
room
just
the
teasing
void
of
memory
.
more
than
any
other
place
in
our
home
the
living
room
was
symbolic
of
my
nomadic
and
borrowed
life
.
vagrant
pieces
of
furniture
from
different
times
and
places
were
thrown
together
partly
out
of
financial
necessity
and
partly
because
of
my
eclectic
taste
.
oddly
these
incongruous
ingredients
created
a
symmetry
that
the
other
more
deliberately
furnished
rooms
in
the
apartment
lacked
.
my
mother
would
go
crazy
each
time
she
saw
the
paintings
leaning
against
the
wall
and
the
vases
of
flowers
on
the
floor
and
the
curtainless
windows
which
i
refused
to
dress
until
i
was
finally
reminded
that
this
was
an
islamic
country
and
windows
needed
to
be
dressed
.
i
dont
know
if
you
really
belong
to
me
she
would
lament
.
didnt
i
raise
you
to
be
orderly
and
organized
her
tone
was
serious
but
she
had
repeated
the
same
complaint
for
so
many
years
that
by
now
it
was
an
almost
tender
ritual
.
azi-that
was
my
nickname-azi
she
would
say
you
are
a
grown-up
lady
now
act
like
one
.
yet
there
was
something
in
her
tone
that
kept
me
young
and
fragile
and
obstinate
and
still
when
in
memory
i
hear
her
voice
i
know
i
never
lived
up
to
her
expectations
.
i
never
did
become
the
lady
she
tried
to
will
me
into
being
.
that
room
which
i
never
paid
much
attention
to
at
that
time
has
gained
a
different
status
in
my
minds
eye
now
that
it
has
become
the
precious
object
of
memory
.
it
was
a
spacious
room
sparsely
furnished
and
decorated
.
at
one
corner
was
the
fireplace
a
fanciful
creation
of
my
husband
bijan
.
there
was
a
love
seat
against
one
wall
over
which
i
had
thrown
a
lace
cover
my
mothers
gift
from
long
ago
.
a
pale
peach
couch
faced
the
window
accompanied
by
two
matching
chairs
and
a
big
square
glass-topped
iron
table
.
my
place
was
always
in
the
chair
with
its
back
to
the
window
which
opened
onto
a
wide
cul-de-sac
called
azar
.
opposite
the
window
was
the
former
american
hospital
once
small
and
exclusive
now
a
noisy
overcrowded
medical
facility
for
wounded
and
disabled
veterans
of
the
war
.
on
weekends-thursdays
and
fridays
in
iran-
the
small
street
was
crowded
with
hospital
visitors
who
came
as
if
for
a
picnic
with
sandwiches
and
children
.
the
neighbors
front
yard
his
pride
and
joy
was
the
main
victim
of
their
assaults
especially
in
summer
when
they
helped
themselves
to
his
beloved
roses
.
we
could
hear
the
sound
of
children
shouting
crying
and
laughing
and
mingled
in
their
mothers
voices
also
shouting
calling
out
their
childrens
names
and
threatening
them
with
punishments
.
sometimes
a
child
or
two
would
ring
our
doorbell
and
run
away
repeating
their
perilous
exercise
at
intervals
.
from
our
second-story
apartment-my
mother
occupied
the
first
floor
and
my
brothers
apartment
on
the
third
floor
was
often
empty
since
he
had
left
for
england-we
could
see
the
upper
branches
of
a
generous
tree
and
in
the
distance
over
the
buildings
the
elburz
mountains
.
the
street
the
hospital
and
its
visitors
were
censored
out
of
sight
.
we
felt
their
presence
only
through
the
disembodied
noises
emanating
from
below
.
i
could
not
see
my
favorite
mountains
from
where
i
sat
but
opposite
my
chair
on
the
far
wall
of
the
dining
room
was
an
antique
oval
mirror
a
gift
from
my
father
and
in
its
reflection
i
could
see
the
mountains
capped
with
snow
even
in
summer
and
watch
the
trees
change
color
.
that
censored
view
intensified
my
impression
that
the
noise
came
not
from
the
street
below
but
from
some
far-off
place
a
place
whose
persistent
hum
was
our
only
link
to
the
world
we
refused
for
those
few
hours
to
acknowledge
.
that
room
for
all
of
us
became
a
place
of
transgression
.
what
a
wonderland
it
was
sitting
around
the
large
coffee
table
covered
with
bouquets
of
flowers
we
moved
in
and
out
of
the
novels
we
read
.
looking
back
i
am
amazed
at
how
much
we
learned
without
even
noticing
it
.
we
were
to
borrow
from
nabokov
to
experience
how
the
ordinary
pebble
of
ordinary
life
could
be
transformed
into
a
jewel
through
the
magic
eye
of
fiction
