biography
in
terms
of
sales
and
lasting
popularity
elton
john
was
the
biggest
pop
superstar
of
the
early
'70s
.
initially
marketed
as
a
singersongwriter
john
soon
revealed
he
could
craft
beatlesque
pop
and
pound
out
rockers
with
equal
aplomb
.
he
could
dip
into
soul
disco
and
country
as
well
as
classic
pop
balladry
and
even
progressive
rock
.
his
versatility
combined
with
his
effortless
melodic
skills
dynamic
charisma
and
flamboyant
stage
shows
made
him
the
most
popular
recording
artist
of
the
'70s
.
unlike
many
pop
stars
john
was
able
to
sustain
his
popularity
charting
a
top
40
single
every
single
year
from
1970
to
1996
.
during
that
time
he
had
temporary
slumps
in
creativity
and
sales
as
he
fell
out
of
favor
with
critics
had
fights
with
his
lyricist
bernie
taupin
and
battled
various
addictions
and
public
scandals
.
but
through
it
all
john
remained
a
remarkably
popular
artist
and
many
of
his
songs
including
``
your
song
''
``
rocket
man
''
``
goodbye
yellow
brick
road
''
and
``
do
n't
let
the
sun
go
down
on
me
''
became
contemporary
pop
standards.the
son
of
a
former
royal
air
force
trumpeter
john
was
born
reginald
kenneth
dwight
in
1947
.
dwight
began
playing
piano
at
the
age
of
four
and
when
he
was
11
he
won
a
scholarship
to
the
royal
academy
of
music
.
after
studying
for
six
years
he
left
school
with
the
intention
of
breaking
into
the
music
business
.
in
1961
he
joined
his
first
band
bluesology
and
divided
his
time
between
playing
with
the
group
giving
solo
concerts
at
a
local
hotel
and
running
errands
for
a
london
publishing
house
.
by
1965
bluesology
was
backing
touring
american
soul
and
rb
musicians
like
major
lance
doris
troy
and
the
bluebells
.
in
1966
bluesology
became
long
john
baldry
's
supporting
band
and
began
touring
cabarets
throughout
england
.
dwight
became
frustrated
with
baldry
's
control
of
the
band
and
began
searching
for
other
groups
to
join
.
he
failed
his
lead
vocalist
auditions
for
both
king
crimson
and
gentle
giant
before
responding
to
an
advertisement
by
liberty
records
.
though
he
failed
his
liberty
audition
he
was
given
a
stack
of
lyrics
left
with
the
label
courtesy
of
bernie
taupin
who
had
also
replied
to
the
ad
.
dwight
wrote
music
for
taupin
's
lyrics
and
began
corresponding
with
him
through
mail
.
by
the
time
the
two
met
six
months
later
dwight
had
changed
his
name
to
elton
john
taking
his
first
name
from
bluesology
saxophonist
elton
dean
and
his
last
from
john
baldry.john
and
taupin
were
hired
by
dick
james
to
become
staff
songwriters
at
his
fledgling
djm
in
1968
.
the
pair
collaborated
at
a
rapid
rate
with
taupin
submitting
batches
of
lyrics
he
often
wrote
a
song
an
hour
every
few
weeks
.
john
would
then
write
music
without
changing
the
words
sometimes
completing
the
songs
in
under
a
half-hour
.
over
the
next
two
years
the
duo
wrote
songs
for
pop
singers
like
roger
cook
and
lulu
.
in
the
meantime
john
recorded
cover
versions
of
current
hits
for
budget
labels
to
be
sold
in
supermarkets
.
by
the
summer
of
1968
he
had
begun
recording
singles
for
release
under
his
own
name
.
usually
these
songs
were
more
rock-
and
radio-oriented
than
the
tunes
he
and
taupin
were
giving
to
other
vocalists
yet
neither
of
his
early
singles
for
philips
``
i
've
been
loving
you
too
long
''
and
``
lady
samantha
''
sold
well
.
in
june
of
1969
he
released
his
debut
album
for
djm
empty
sky
which
received
fair
reviews
but
no
sales
.
for
his
second
album
john
and
taupin
hired
producer
gus
dudgeon
and
arranger
paul
buckmaster
who
contributed
grandiose
string
charts
to
elton
john
.
released
in
the
summer
of
1970
elton
john
began
to
make
inroads
in
america
where
it
appeared
on
mca
's
uni
subsidiary
.
in
august
he
gave
his
first
american
concert
at
the
troubadour
in
los
angeles
which
received
enthusiastic
reviews
as
well
as
praise
from
quincy
jones
and
leon
russell
.
throughout
the
fall
elton
john
continued
to
climb
the
charts
on
the
strength
of
the
top
ten
single
``
your
song
.
''
john
followed
it
quickly
in
late
1970
with
the
concept
album
tumbleweed
connection
which
received
heavy
airplay
on
album-oriented
radio
in
the
u.s.
helping
it
climb
into
the
top
ten
.
the
rapid
release
of
tumbleweed
connection
established
a
pattern
of
frequent
releases
that
john
maintained
throughout
his
career
.
in
1971
he
released
the
live
11-17-70
and
the
friends
soundtrack
before
releasing
madman
across
the
water
late
in
the
year
.
madman
across
the
water
was
successful
but
john
achieved
stardom
with
the
follow-up
1972
's
honky
chateau
.
recorded
with
his
touring
band
bassist
dee
murray
drummer
nigel
olsson
and
guitarist
davey
johnstone
and
featuring
the
hit
singles
``
rocket
man
''
and
``
honky
cat
''
honky
chateau
became
his
first
american
number
one
album
spending
five
weeks
at
the
top
of
the
charts
.
between
1972
and
1976
john
and
taupin
's
hitmaking
machine
was
virtually
unstoppable
.
``
rocket
man
''
began
a
four-year
streak
of
16
top
20
hits
in
a
row
out
of
those
16
including
``
crocodile
rock
''
``
daniel

``
bennie
and
the

''
``

''
and
``

''
only
one
the
fm
hit
``
saturday
night

''
failed
to
reach
the
top
ten
.
honky

john
founded
rocket
a
record
label
distributed
by
mca
in
1973
in
order
to
sign
and
produce
acts
like
neil
sedaka
and
kiki
dee
.
john
did
n't
become
a
rocket
recording
artist
himself
choosing
to
stay
with
mca
for
a
record-breaking
eight-million-dollar
contract
in
1974
.
later
in
1974
he
played
and
sang
on
john
lennon
's
number
one
comeback
single
``
whatever
gets
you
through
the
night
''
and
he
persuaded
lennon
to
join
him
on-stage
at
madison
square
garden
on
thanksgiving
day
1974
it
would
prove
to
be
lennon
's
last
live
performance
.
the
following
year
captain
fantastic
became
john
's
first
album
to
enter
the
american
charts
at
number
one
.
after
its
release
he
revamped
his
band
which
now
featured
johnstone
quaye
roger
pope
ray
cooper
and
bassist
kenny
passarelli
rock
of
the
westies
was
the
first
album
to
feature
this
lineup
.
throughout
the
mid-'70s
john
's
concerts
were
enormously
popular
as
were
his
singles
and
albums
and
he
continued
to
record
and
perform
at
a
rapid
pace
until
1976
.
that
year
he
revealed
in
an
interview
in
rolling
stone
that
he
was
bisexual
he
would
later
admit
that
the
confession
was
a
compromise
since
he
was
afraid
to
reveal
that
he
was
homosexual
.
many
fans
reacted
negatively
to
john
's
bisexuality
and
his
audience
began
to
shrink
somewhat
in
the
late
'70s
.
the
decline
in
his
record
sales
was
also
due
to
his
exhaustion
.
after
1976
john
cut
his
performance
schedule
drastically
announcing
that
he
was
retiring
from
live
performances
in
1977
and
started
recording
only
one
album
a
year
.
his
relationship
with
taupin
became
strained
following
the
release
of
1976
's
double
album
blue
moves
and
the
lyricist
began
working
with
other
musicians
.
john
returned
in
1978
with
a
single
man
which
was
written
with
gary
osborne
the
record
produced
no
top
20
singles
.
that
year
he
returned
to
live
performances
first
by
jamming
at
the
live
stiffs
package
tour
then
by
launching
a
comeback
tour
in
1979
accompanied
only
by
percussionist
ray
cooper
.
``
mama
ca
n't
buy
you
love
''
a
song
he
recorded
with
philly
soul
producer
thom
bell
in
1977
returned
him
to
the
top
ten
in
1979
but
that
year
's
victim
of
love
was
a
commercial
disappointment
.
john
reunited
with
taupin
for
1980
's
21
at
33
which
featured
the
top
ten
single
``
little
jeannie
.
''
over
the
next
three
years
john
remained
a
popular
concert
artist
but
his
singles
failed
to
break
the
top
ten
even
if
they
reached
the
top
40
.
in
1981
he
signed
with
geffen
records
and
his
second
album
jump
up
became
a
gold
album
on
the
strength
of
``
blue
eyes
''
and
``
empty
garden
hey
hey
johnny
''
his
tribute
to
john
lennon
.
but
it
was
1983
's
too
low
for
zero
that
began
his
last
great
streak
of
hit
singles
with
the
mtv
hit
``
i
'm
still
standing
''
and
the
top
ten
single
``
i
guess
that
's
why
they
call
it
the
blues
.
''
throughout
the
rest
of
the
'80s
john
's
albums
would
consistently
go
gold
and
they
always
generated
at
least
one
top
40
single
frequently
they
featured
top
ten
singles
like
``
sad
songs
say
so
much
''
1984
``
nikita
''
1986
``
candle
in
the
wind
''
1987
and
``
i
do
n't
want
to
go
on
with
you
like
that
''
1988
.
while
his
career
continued
to
be
successful
his
personal
life
was
in
turmoil
.
since
the
mid-'70s
he
had
been
addicted
to
cocaine
and
alcohol
and
the
situation
only
worsened
during
the
'80s
.
in
a
surprise
move
he
married
engineer
renate
blauel
in
1984
the
couple
stayed
married
for
four
years
although
john
later
admitted
he
realized
he
was
homosexual
before
his
marriage
.
in
1986
he
underwent
throat
surgery
while
on
tour
but
even
after
he
successfully
recovered
he
continued
to
abuse
cocaine
and
alcohol
.
following
a
record-breaking
five-date
stint
at
madison
square
garden
in
1988
john
auctioned
off
all
of
his
theatrical
costumes
thousands
of
pieces
of
memorabilia
and
his
extensive
record
collection
through
sotheby
's
.
the
auction
was
a
symbolic
turning
point
.
over
the
next
two
years
john
battled
both
his
drug
addiction
and
bulimia
undergoing
hair
replacement
surgery
at
the
same
time
.
by
1991
he
was
sober
and
the
following
year
he
established
the
elton
john
aids
foundation
he
also
announced
that
he
would
donate
all
royalties
from
his
single
sales
to
aids

john
returned
to
active
recording

peaking
at
number
eight
on
the
u.s.
charts
and
going
double
platinum
the
album
became
his
most
successful
record
since
blue
moves
and
sparked
a
career
renaissance
for
john
.
he
and
taupin
signed
a
record-breaking
publishing
deal
with
warnerchappell
music
in
1992
for
an
estimated
39
million
dollars
.
in
1994
john
collaborated
with
lyricist
tim
rice
on
songs
for
disney
's
animated
feature
the
lion
king
.
one
of
their
collaborations

''
won
the
academy
award
for
best
original

as
well
as

pop

and
produced
a
hit
in

was
overshadowed
by
john

to
the
tragic
death
of

he
re-recorded

and
with

became
the

upon

success
commercially
