it
's
an
icon
for
teenage
rebellion
salinger
spent
a
lot
of
time
refusing
requests
to
adapt
the
novel
.
among
those
who
have
tried
to
get
a

version
made
are
marlon

salinger
was
working
on
a
version
of
the
book
when
he
was
fighting

during

a
favourite
with
murderers
mark
david
chapman
the
killer
of
john
lennon
so
identified
with
the
salinger
's
antihero
that
he
wanted
to
change
his
name
to
holden
caulfield
.
robert
john
bardo
another
killer
was
carrying
a
copy
of
the
book
the
night
he
murdered
actress
rebecca

a
career

salinger
could
have
been
a
meat
importer
â
his
father
was
a
successful
meat
and
cheese
merchant
who
sent
his
son
to
austria
to
brush
up
on
the
trade
before
the

luckily
salinger
left
after
only
a

they
also
named
an
earlier

they
could
n't
find
a
rhyme
for
