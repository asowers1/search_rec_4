harvey

the
dark

sacrificed
everything
for
what

gordon
both
hoped
was
the

.
for
a

the
lie
worked
as
criminal
activity
in
gotham
city
was
crushed
under
the
weight
of
the
anti-crime

but
everything
will
change
with
the
arrival
of
a
cunning
cat
burglar
with
a
mysterious

dangerous
however
is
the
emergence
of

whose
ruthless
plans
for
gotham
drive
bruce
out
of
his
self-imposed

technically
the
dark
knight
rises
is
a
thick
leatherbound
volume
with
gilded
pages
though
flipping
through
it
yields
a
story
about
a

to

½
eight
years
after
the
death
of
harvey
dent
a
reclusive
bruce
wayne
brings
batman
out
of
retirement
to
combat
a
ruthless
mercenary
with
an
army
of
fanatical
followers
who
hold
the
entire
city
of
gotham
for
ransom
.
i
feel
i
have
to
begin
this
review
by
pointing
out
that
the
dark
knight
rises
is
a
beautifully
crafted
superhero
blockbuster
because
otherwise
it
's
going
to
sound
extremely
negative
the
problem
for
me
is
that
this
film
is
somewhat
lacking
in
the
``
x
factor
''
that
made
the
first
two
instalments
seem
so
very
special
.
let
's
face
it
tom
hardy
had
an
act
that
's
basically
impossible
to
follow
but
when
the
script
touched
on
the
moral
ambiguity
of
the
character
of
bruce
wayne
that
he
's
essentially
a
billionaire
who
goes
around
beating
up
poor
people
to
maintain
the
establishment
's
status
quo
i
thought
that
nolan
had
done
it
again
.
unfortunately
he
chose
not
to
explore
the
social
implications
instead
electing
to
hang
a
bomb
over
the
heads
of
this
``
citizen
's
revolution
''
reducing
bane
to
another
hostage
taking
thug
instead
of
a
radical
revolutionary
.
i
also
think
that
removing
alfred
and
therefore
much
of
the
humanity
and
humour
from
the
equation
was
a
mistake
and
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
ambiguity
a
la
inception
as
to
the
fate
of
the
character
.
plus
i
could
also
point
out
that
the
story
is
basically
rocky
iii
crossed
with
star
wars
with
yet
another
generic
race
against
time
tacked
onto
the
end
.
all
of
these
complaints
conspired
to
make
me
somewhat
disappointed
with
the
film
but
i
reiterate
this
is
only
by
the
incredibly
high
standards
that
were
set
by
the
franchise
.
by
any
others
the
dark
rises
is
an
excellent
piece
of
entertainment
and
deserving
of
the
highest
praise
as
a
fitting
conclusion
to
a
series
that
has
single
handedly
raised
the
bar
for
the
quality
of
mainstream
cinema
.
