salinger
's
new
yorker
stories
particularly
a
perfect
day
for
bananafish
uncle
wiggily
in
connecticut
the
laughing
man
and
for
esme
with
love
and
squalor
will
not
be
surprised
by
the
fact
that
his
first
novel
is
fully
of
children
.
the
hero-narrator
of
the
catcher
in
the
rye
is
an
ancient
child
of
sixteen
a
native
new
yorker
named
holden
caulfield
.
through
circumstances
that
tend
to
preclude
adult
secondhand
description
he
leaves
his
prep
school
in
pennsylvania
and
goes
underground
in
new
york
city
for
three
days
.
the
boy
himself
is
at
once
too
simple
and
too
complex
for
us
to
make
any
final
comment
about
him
or
his
story
.
perhaps
the
safest
thing
we
can
say
about
holden
is
that
he
was
born
in
the
world
not
just
strongly
attracted
to
beauty
but
almost
hopelessly
impaled
on
it
.
there
are
many
voices
in
this
novel
children
's
voices
adult
voices
underground
voices-but
holden
's
voice
is
the
most
eloquent
of
all
.
transcending
his
own
vernacular
yet
remaining
marvelously
faithful
to
it
he
issues
a
perfectly
articulated
cry
of
mixed
pain
and
pleasure
.
however
like
most
lovers
and
clowns
and
poets
of
the
higher
orders
he
keeps
most
of
the
pain
to
and
for
himself
.
the
pleasure
he
gives
away
or
sets
aside
with
all
his
heart
.
it
is
there
for
the
reader
who
can
handle
it
to
keep
.

holden
caulfield
a
seventeen
year
old
prep
school
adolescent
relates
his
lonely
life-changing
twenty-four
hour
stay
in
new

city
as
he
experiences
the
phoniness
of
the
adult
world
while
attempting
to
deal
with
the
death
of
his
younger
brother
an
overwhelming
compulsion
to
lie
and
troubling
sexual
experiences.salinger
whose
characters
are
among
the
best
and
most
developed
in
all
of
literature
has
captured
the
eternal
angst
of
growing
into
adulthood
in
the
person
of
holden
caulfield
.
anyone
who

reached
the
age
of

unique
and
yet
universal
character

it

for
this
very

that

has
become
one
of
the
most
beloved
and
enduring
works

always
salinger
's
writing
is
so
brilliant
his
characters
so
real
that
he
need

any

.
this
is
a
study
of
the
complex
problems
haunting
all
adolescents
as
they
mature
into
adulthood
and
salinger
wisely
chooses
to
keep
his
narrative
and
prose
straightforward
and
simple.this
is
not

the

hardcover
time
has
not

it
remains
a
sometimes
harrowing
sometimes
absorbing
sometimes
frustrating
sometimes
moving
look

books
or
have
been
more
overtly
anti-social
but
with
the
catcher
in
the
rye
j.d
.
salinger
captures
the
bitterly
confused
mind
of
a
youth
who
hates
the
whole
world
not
because
the
world
is
worth
hating
but
because
he
's
frustrated
at
his
own
inability
to
get
along
in
that
world
with
such
crisp
reality
that
it
shocks
far
more
than
any
fantastical
american
psycho.reading
over
the
negative
reviews
on
amazon
i
ca
n't
help
but
wonder
how
and
why
so
many
people
are
so
unable
to
get
it
.
the
catcher
in
the
rye
is
among
the
if
not
the
most
tangibly
realistic
looks
into
the
mind
of
a
disaffected
disillusioned
youth
suffering
from
depression
and
a
touch
of
the
bipolar
.
the
way
holden
caulfield
's
mind
works
is
incredibly
true
to
form
-
the
contradictions
the
hypocrisy
the
confusion
the
brief
moments
of
sheer
clarity
followed
by
stretches
of
irrational
thought
.
he
thinks
he
's
better
than
the
world
and
he
thinks
he
's
the
lousiest
person
in
the
world
at
the
same
time
.
he
wants
everyone
to
go
away
and
leave
him
alone
and
he
ca
n't
bear
anyone
not
even
some
schmuck
he
really
dislikes
with
good
reason
to
leave
him
.
he
's
nothing
but
hypocrisy
and
contradictions
and
confusion
.
salinger
captures
this
in
an
amazing
way.people
criticize
the
book
because
caulfield
is
totally
unlikable
a
guy
who
rails
against
phonies
when
he
himself
is
something
of
a
phony
...
but
that
's
part
of
the
point
.
holden
throws
off
all
the
signals
someone
in
his
situation
actually
throws
off
in
real
life
and
just
like
real
life
they
're
almost
always
ignored.read

it
is
difficult
to
remember
what
it
was
like
to
read
this
book
for
the
first
time
.
it
is
also
difficult
to
imagine
a
book
where
each
new
reading
provides
so
much
more
illumination
into
the
main
character
and
his
personality
.
i
can
remember
finding
catcher
to
be
funny
the
first
time
i
read
it
.
i
now
alternately
find
holden
to
be
walking
a
fine
line
between
witty
sarcasm
and
dangerous
cynicism
.
he
is
funny
there
is
no
way
around
that
but
his
belittling
nature
also
causes
him
to
dismiss
much
from
his
life
that
may
not
be
perfect
but
should
be
included
.
there
is
nothing
that
he
in
the
end
does
not
dismiss
as
being
phony
whether
it
is
the
nuns
with
whom
he
shares
a
cup
of
coffee
the
teacher
at
the
end
who
most
likely
was
just
trying
to
help
the
egyptian
wing
of
the
museum
pheobe
's
school
...
everything
.
as
soon
as
one
little
detail
slips
in
which
is
not
completely
on
track
with
what
he
is
thinking
whatever
it
is
he
is
contemplating
becomes
useless
phony
not
worth
dealing
with
.
his
humor
is
sharp
and
witty
and
i
often
laugh
out
loud
while
reading
but
it
is
also
an
easy
way
for
him
to
detach
himself
from
a
world
which
he
no
longer
feels
he
belongs
in
or
wants
to
belong
in
.
i
can
remember
finding
the
ending
ambiguous
the
first
time
i
read
it
.
i
now
see
it
as
the
only
way
it
could
end
with
holden
finding
happiness
watching
his
sister
pheobe
going
forever
in
circles
and
being
able
to
pretend
that
that
is
never
going
to
change
.
she
is
the
one
thing
in
his
life
which
he
still
deems
worthy
of
existence
and
placing
her
on
a
merry-go-round
is
his
best
attempt
to
keep
her
there
.
things
change
and
grow
and
move
on
but
holden
refuses
to
accept
this
and
is
yearning
to
stop
things
forever
where
they
are
to
go
back
to
when

not
worth
it
any
more
surprisingly
this
did
n't
hold
up
over
time
ergo
not
a
classic
.
when
i
read
it
back
in
the
early
60s
it
seemed
edgy
and
rather
exciting
.
now
it
's
entirely
dated
.
