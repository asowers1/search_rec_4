song
titles

are
currently
available
from
the
new
album
are
living
for
love
devil
pray
ghosttown
unapologetic
bitch
illuminati
and
bitch
i
'm
madonna
which
was
recorded
with
nicki
minaj
.
producers
include
madonna
diplo
kanye
west
billboard
was
recorded
in
ny
la
and
london
.
the
decision
to
release
the
songs
much
earlier
than
anticipated
was
due
to
the
leaking
of
several
work-in-progress
demos
earlier
this
week
.
``
i
was
hoping
to
release
my
new
single
'living
for
love
'
on
valentine
's
day
with
the
rest
of
the
album
coming
in
the
spring
.
i
would
prefer
my
fans
to
hear
completed
versions
of
some
of
the
songs
instead
of
the
incomplete
tracks
that
are
circulating
.
please
consider
these
six
songs
as
an
early
christmas
gift
