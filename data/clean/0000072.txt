plot
overviewcontextcharacter
list
in
the
novels
foreword
the
fictional
john
ray
jr.
ph.d.
explains
the
strange
story
that
will
follow
.
according
to
ray
he
received
the
manuscript
entitled
lolita
or
the
confession
of
a
white
widowed
male
from
the
authors
lawyer
.
the
author
himself
known
by
the
pseudonym
of
humbert
humbert
or
h.
h.
died
in
jail
of
coronary
thrombosis
while
awaiting
a
trial
.
ray
asserts
that
while
the
authors
actions
are
despicable
his
writing
remains
beautiful
and
persuasive
.
he
also
indicates
that
the
novel
will
become
a
favorite
in
psychiatric
circles
as
well
as
encourage
parents
to
raise
better
children
in
a
better
world
.
in
the
manuscript
humbert
relates
his
peaceful
upbringing
on
the
riviera
where
he
encounters
his
first
love
the
twelve-year-old
annabel
leigh
.
annabel
and
the
thirteen-year-old
humbert
never
consummate
their
love
and
annabels
death
from
typhus
four
months
later
haunts
humbert
.
although
humbert
goes
on
to
a
career
as
a
teacher
of
english
literature
he
spends
time
in
a
mental
institution
and
works
a
succession
of
odd
jobs
.
despite
his
marriage
to
an
adult
woman
which
eventually
fails
humbert
remains
obsessed
with
sexually
desirable
and
sexually
aware
young
girls
.
these
nymphets
as
he
calls
them
remind
him
of
annabel
though
he
fails
to
find
another
like
her
.
eventually
humbert
comes
to
the
united
states
and
takes
a
room
in
the
house
of
widow
charlotte
haze
in
a
sleepy
suburban
new
england
town
.
he
becomes
instantly
infatuated
with
her
twelve-year-old
daughter
dolores
also
known
as
lolita
.
humbert
follows
lolitas
moves
constantly
occasionally
flirts
with
her
and
confides
his
pedophiliac
longings
to
a
journal
.
meanwhile
charlotte
haze
whom
humbert
loathes
has
fallen
in
love
with
him
.
when
charlotte
sends
lolita
off
to
summer
camp
humbert
marries
charlotte
in
order
to
stay
near
his
true
love
.
humbert
wants
to
be
alone
with
lolita
and
even
toys
with
the
idea
of
killing
charlotte
but
he
cant
go
through
with
it
.
however
charlotte
finds
his
diary
and
after
learning
that
he
hates
her
but
loves
her
daughter
confronts
him
.
humbert
denies
everything
but
charlotte
tells
him
she
is
leaving
him
and
storms
out
of
the
house
.
at
that
moment
a
car
hits
her
and
she
dies
instantly
.
humbert
goes
to
the
summer
camp
and
picks
up
lolita
.
only
when
they
arrive
at
a
motel
does
he
tell
her
that
charlotte
has
died
.
in
his
account
of
events
humbert
claims
that
lolita
seduces
him
rather
than
the
other
way
around
.
the
two
drive
across
the
country
for
nearly
a
year
during
which
time
humbert
becomes
increasingly
obsessed
with
lolita
and
she
learns
to
manipulate
him
.
when
she
engages
in
tantrums
or
refuses
his
advances
humbert
threatens
to
put
her
in
an
orphanage
.
at
the
same
time
a
strange
man
seems
to
take
an
interest
in
humbert
and
lolita
and
appears
to
be
following
them
in
their
travels
.
humbert
eventually
gets
a
job
at
beardsley
college
somewhere
in
the
northeast
and
lolita
enrolls
in
school
.
her
wish
to
socialize
with
boys
her
own
age
causes
a
strain
in
their
relationship
and
humbert
becomes
more
restrictive
in
his
rules
.
nonetheless
he
allows
her
to
appear
in
a
school
play
.
lolita
begins
to
behave
secretively
around
humbert
and
he
accuses
her
of
being
unfaithful
and
takes
her
away
on
another
road
trip
.
on
the
road
humbert
suspects
that
they
are
being
followed
.
lolita
doesnt
notice
anything
and
humbert
accuses
her
of
conspiring
with
their
stalker
.
lolita
becomes
ill
and
humbert
must
take
her
to
the
hospital
.
however
when
humbert
returns
to
get
her
the
nurses
tell
him
that
her
uncle
has
already
picked
her
up
.
humbert
flies
into
a
rage
but
then
he
calms
himself
and
leaves
the
hospital
heartbroken
and
angry
.
for
the
next
two
years
humbert
searches
for
lolita
unearthing
clues
about
her
kidnapper
in
order
to
exact
his
revenge
.
he
halfheartedly
takes
up
with
a
woman
named
rita
but
then
he
receives
a
note
from
lolita
now
married
and
pregnant
asking
for
money
.
assuming
that
lolita
has
married
the
man
who
had
followed
them
on
their
travels
humbert
becomes
determined
to
kill
him
.
he
finds
lolita
poor
and
pregnant
at
seventeen
.
humbert
realizes
that
lolitas
husband
is
not
the
man
who
kidnapped
her
from
the
hospital
.
when
pressed
lolita
admits
that
clare
quilty
a
playwright
whose
presence
has
been
felt
from
the
beginning
of
the
book
had
taken
her
from
the
hospital
.
lolita
loved
quilty
but
he
kicked
her
out
when
she
refused
to
participate
in
a
child
pornography
orgy
.
still
devoted
to
lolita
humbert
begs
her
to
return
to
him
.
lolita
gently
refuses
.
humbert
gives
her
4000
dollars
and
then
departs
.
he
tracks
down
quilty
at
his
house
and
shoots
him
multiple
times
killing
him
.
humbert
is
arrested
and
put
in
jail
where
he
continues
to
write
his
memoir
stipulating
that
it
can
only
be
published
upon
lolitas
death
.
after
lolita
dies
in
childbirth
humbert
dies
of
heart
failure
and

lolita
is
a
child
in
the
early
stages

humbert
being

i
think
there
's
a
bit
of
a
deeper
meaning
to
the
end
of
chapter
35
.
as
we
see
when
humbert
goes
downstairs
after
killing
quilty
there
appears
to
be
a
party
or
at
least
some
sort
of
social
gathering
occurring
none
of
which
humbert
noticed
before
dismissing
the
noise
they
had
been
making
as
``
a
mere
singing
in
his
ears
.
''
the
people
at
this
gathering
seem
not
to
care
about
the
fact
that
he
has
just
committed
murder
upstairs
and
one
even
congratulates
him
``
somebody
ought
to
have
done
it
long
ago
.
