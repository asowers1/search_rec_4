the
100
greatest
madonna
songs
by
louis
virtel
february
3
2012
the
premiere
of
madonnas
video
for
give
me
all
your
luvin
the
first
single
off
her
new
album
m.d.n.a
.
is
today
children
.
its
bound
to
be
a
little
over-the-top
and
nutty
like
the
deranged
song
itself
and
i
assume
its
not
going
to
live
up
to
the
greatest
stuff
in
madonnas
catalog
.
then
i
remember
what
does
live
up
to
the
best
stuff
in
madonnas
catalog
turns
out
not
much
.
madonnas
repertoire
is
a
varied
and
thundering
collection
of
self-empowering
pop
ditties
soulful
ballads
and
kooky
little
anomalies
.
and
theyre
mostly
all
irreplaceable
.
in
the
tradition
of
rolling
stone
who
listed
their
100
greatest
beatles
songs
a
couple
years
ago
lets
reinspect
madonnas
complete
history
and
name
her
definitive
100
jams
.
ready
start
disagreeing
now
.
100
.
dance
2night
from
hard
candy
hard
candyâs
most
euphoric
groove
and
best
dancefloor-filler
makes
the
stilted
duo
of
madge
and
justin
timberlake
seem
like
a
proper
dancefloor
romance
.
99.
âcanât
stopâ
from
the
whoâs
that
girl
soundtrack
nobody
croons
about
insatiability
like
madonna
and
this
lesser-known
track
from
the
filmic
milestone
whoâs
that
girl
was
no
doubt
a
help
in
winning
over
griffin
dunne
.
98.
âyou
must
love
meâ
from
the
evita
soundtrack
itâs
an
oscar-winning
ballad
but
âyou
must
love
meâ
is
more
notable
as
a
showcase
paradoxically
both
for
madonnaâs
headmasterly
chill
and
surprising
vulnerability
.
97.
â4
minutesâ
from
hard
candy
while
madonna
has
enjoyed
duets
with
more
fitting
partners
her
collaboration
with
justin
timberlake
yielded
this
bumping
boinging
precursor
to
armageddon
.
96.
âi
love
new
yorkâ
from
confessions
on
a
dance
floor
the
lyrics
dorky
.
the
street-tough
grit
contrived
.
but
somehow
madonnaâs
renewed
danceteria
chutzpah
sells
this
piece
of
glitzed-out
camp
.
itâs
the
sex
and
the
city
2
of
madonna
songs
â
unforgivable
yet
undeniably
fun
.
95.
âbye
bye
babyâ
from
erotica
a
candidate
for
the
frostiest
song
on
erotica
âbye
bye
babyâ
is
a
hip-hop
kiss-off
with
cabaret
flair
.
and
it
made
for
a
hell
of
a
vma
performance
.
94.
ânothing
really
mattersâ
from
ray
of
light
copping
both
new-age
maxims
and
beatle
sentiments
âeverything
i
give
you
all
comes
back
to
meâ
ânothing
really
mattersâ
is
as
queer
and
curious
as
a
red
patent-leather
geisha
costume
.
93.
âshoo-bee-dooâ
from
like
a
virgin
âshoo-bee-doo-bee-doo
babyâ
should
not
work
as
a
triumphant
chorus
but
madonna
delivers
it
with
such
a
fierce
preteen
urgency
that
its
nonsense
melodrama
is
downright
moving
.
92.
âsuper
popâ
from
confessions
on
a
dance
floor
bonus
track
madonnaâs
megalomania
is
at
peak
insanity
here
but
sheâs
pretty
damn
provocative
and
nervy
about
it
.
after
mysteriously
namedropping
isaac
newton
and
martin
luther
she
throws
down
a
few
interesting
and
hilarious
proclamations
.
my
favorite
âif
i
was
a
song
i
would
be
âsuper
pop.ââ
sounds
like
a
decent
epitaph
from
here
.
91.
âlove
profusionâ
from
american
life
cryptic
though
it
may
be
to
listeners
âlove
profusionâ
sounds
like
a
moment
of
sweet
clarity
to
its
singer
.
when
you
start
referencing
cole
porter
lyrics
âiâve
got
you
under
my
skinâ
you
must
be
pretty
stoked
.
90.
âtrue
blueâ
from
true
blue
the
title
track
off
madonnaâs
most
celebratory
album
is
a
cutesy
tribute
to
girl
groups
with
one
hell
of
a
romantic
swell
.
her
annie-esque
call
of
âthe
sun
is
bursting
right
out
of
the
skyâ
hopefully
melted
sean
penn
a
bit
.
89.
âinterventionâ
from
american
life
if
american
life
had
been
an
ep
featuring
the
four-song
sequence
from
âlove
profusionâ
to
âinterventionâ
i
could
possibly
give
it
a
sterling
recommendation
.
as
such
âinterventionâ
is
a
lovely
anomaly
on
that
misfired
album
in
its
hopeful
and
unpretentious
message
.
88.
âhow
highâ
from
confessions
on
a
dance
floor
madonna
set
out
to
make
electronic
music
more
accessible
and
cerebral
on
ray
of
light
and
she
continues
in
that
tradition
on
confessionsâ
âhow
high.â
her
pulsing
interrogations
about
fame
fulfillment
and
meaning
here
are
compelling
and
articulate
.
87.
âjimmy
jimmyâ
from
true
blue
after
her
toast
to
james
cagney
on
âwhite
heatâ
madonnaâs
silly
ode
to
a
dangerous
lover
named
jimmy
feels
like
an
overjoyed
bit
of
fan-fiction
.
but
donât
we
all
want
a
man
who
cradles
us
in
one
arm
while
brandishing
a
tommy
gun
in
the
other
.
86.
âwhyâs
it
so
hardâ
from
erotica
like
most
great
madonna
albums
erotica
features
a
plea
for
understanding
and
world
unity
deep
into
its
second
half
.
âwhyâs
it
so
hardâ
is
both
trite
and
deeply
sincere
and
itâs
always
refreshing
to
hear
madonna
â
a
middle
child
if
ever
one
existed
â
call
out
to
her
âbrothers
and
sisters.â
