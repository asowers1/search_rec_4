i
read
``
the
little
prince
''
1943
by
antoine
de
saint-exupããããâry
so
young
i
only
recalled
the
famous
cover
.
i
know
it
is
an
everlasting
classic
and
expected
to
enjoy
re-learning
it
.
i
'm
mystified
by
how
engrossed
i
became
from
the
first
sentence
.
it
is
positive
rife
with
bright
emotion
but
all
at
once
engaging
quirky
and
clear
.
it
equally
manages
to
make
sense
for
modern
day
life
.
some
call
this
a
book
of
metaphors
but
i
disagree
.
a
writer
has
influences
a
message
to
impart
and
connections
can
surely
be
made
to
other
things
.
that
does
n't
mean
symbols
were
contrived
for
readers
to
guess
.
this
is
one
novel
that
is
if
nothing
else
direct
like
the
little
prince
was
portrayed
.
friends
of
mine
might
woefully
find
similarities
in
me
who
never
speaks
rhetorically
but
seeks
a
reply
this
is
a
almost
a
fairytale
urging
us
to
see
stars
laughing
.
instead
of
probing
double-entendres
i
accepted
the
world
's
parameters
as
presented
a
string
of
sole-occupant
planets
with
space
for
a
house
or
a
desk
.
fiction
often
incorporates
facts
and
thus
a
child
learns
how
asteroids
are
named
and
that
the
size
of
worlds
varies
greatly
.
the
futility
of
alcoholism
is
broached
differently
from
cautionary
videos
in
a
gentle
manner
that
is
effective
.
because
the
pilot
and
prince
chat
about
human
basics
everyone
gets
something
out
of
this
like
creativity
not
being
less
important
than
mathematics
.
the
most
profoundly
struck
chord
describes
people
in
my
life
who
discuss
finances
and
training
instead
of
hopes
and
what
it
is
that
makes
you
you
.
other
than
the
snake
portion
turning
these
pages
was
an
uplifting
respite
.
that
antoine
perished
in
a
plane
too
soon
after
publication
to
see
his
book
's
effects
is
as
lamentable
as
no
longer
receiving
his
tender
literary
and
illustrative
gifts
.

i
was
very
pleasantly
suprised
with
the
quality
of
the
edition
for
paperback
and
a
very
favourable
price
.
the
most
delightful
thing
about
this
book
are
beautiful
antoine
de
saint-exupery

original
illustrations
that

i
loved
reading
this
book
as
a

touching
lovely
timeless
story
.
i
