mr.
brown
takes
the
format
he
has
been
developing
through
three

novels
and
fine-tunes
it
to
blockbuster
perfection
.
not
since
the
advent
of
harry

has
an

so
flagrantly
delighted
in
leading
readers
on

breathless
chase
and

a
tryst
with
mary
magdalene
and
the
interlude
produced
a
child
such
a
possibility-yielding
a
so-called
royal
bloodline-provides
the
framework
for
brown
's
latest
thriller
after
angels
and
demons
an
exhaustively
researched
page-turner
about
secret
religious
societies
ancient
coverups
and
savage
vengeance
.
the
action
kicks
off
in
modern-day
paris
with
the
murder
of
the
louvre
's
chief
curator
whose
body
is
found
laid
out
in
symbolic
repose
at
the
foot
of

mona

seizing

of
the
case
are
sophie

a
lovely
french
police
cryptologist
and
harvard
symbol
expert
robert
langdon
reprising
his
role
from
brown
's
last
book
.
the
two
find
several
puzzling
codes
at
the
murder
scene
all
of
which
form
a
treasure
map
to
the
fabled
holy

where
proof
of
the
jesus
bloodline
supposedly
can
be
found
.
as
their
search
moves
from
france
to
england
neveu
and
langdon
are
confounded
by
two
mysterious
groups-the
legendary
priory
of
sion
a
nearly
1000-year-old
secret
society
whose
members
have
included
botticelli
and
isaac
newton
and
the
conservative
catholic
organization
opus
dei
.
both
have
their
own
reasons
for
wanting
to
ensure
that
the
grail
is
n't
found
.
brown
sometimes
ladles
out
too
much
religious
history
at
the
expense
of
pacing
and
langdon
is
a
hero
in
desperate
need
of
more
chutzpah
.
still
brown
has
assembled
a
whopper
of
a
plot
that
will
please
both
conspiracy
buffs
and
thriller
addicts

robert
langdon
awoke
slowly
.
a
telephone
was
ringing
in
the
darknessâa
tinny
unfamiliar
ring
.
he
fumbled
for
the
bedside
lamp
and
turned
it
on
.
squinting
at
his
surroundings
he
saw
a
plush
renaissance
bedroom
with
louis
xvi
furniture
hand-frescoed
walls
and
a
colossal
mahogany
four-poster
bed
.
where
the
hell
am
i
the
jacquard
bathrobe
hanging
on
his
bedpost
bore
the
monogram
hotel
ritz
paris
.
slowly
the
fog
began
to
lift
.
langdon
picked
up
the
receiver
.
``
hello
''
''
monsieur
langdon
''
a
man
's
voice
said
.
``
i
hope
i
have
not
awoken
you
''
dazed
langdon
looked
at
the
bedside
clock
.
it
was
1232
a.m
.
he
had
been
asleep
only
an
hour
but
he
felt
like
the
dead
.
``
this
is
the
concierge
monsieur
.
i
apologize
for
this
intrusion
but
you
have
a
visitor
.
he
insists
it
is
urgent
.
''
langdon
still
felt
fuzzy
.
a
visitor
his
eyes
focused
now
on
a
crumpled
flyer
on
his
bedside
table
.

university
of

groaned
.
tonight
's
lectureâa
slide
show
about
pagan
symbolism
hidden
in
the
stones
of
chartres
cathedralâhad
probably
ruffled
some
conservative
feathers
in
the
audience
.
most
likely
some
religious
scholar
had
trailed
him
home
to
pick
a
fight
.
``
i
'm
sorry
''
langdon
said
``
but
i
'm
very
tired
andâ
''
''
mais
monsieur
''
the
concierge
pressed
lowering
his
voice
to
an
urgent
whisper
.
``
your
guest
is
an
important
man
.
''
langdon
had
little
doubt
.
his
books
on
religious
paintings
and
cult
symbology
had
made
him
a
reluctant
celebrity
in
the
art
world
and
last
year
langdon
's
visibility
had
increased
a
hundred-fold
after
his
involvement
in
a
widely
publicized
incident
at
the
vatican
.
since
then
the
stream
of
self-important
historians
and
art
buffs
arriving
at
his
door
had
seemed
never-ending
.
``
if
you
would
be
so
kind
''
langdon
said
doing
his
best
to
remain
polite
``
could
you
take
the
man
's
name
and
number
and
tell
him
i
'll
try
to
call
him
before
i
leave
paris
on
tuesday
thank
you
.
''
he
hung
up
before
the
concierge
could
protest
.
sitting
up
now
langdon
frowned
at
his
bedside
guest

whose
cover
boasted
sleep
like

baby
in
the
city
of

.
slumber
at
the
paris
ritz
.
he
turned
and
gazed
tiredly
into
the
full-length
mirror
across
the
room
.
the
man
staring
back
at
him
was
a
strangerâtousled
and
weary
.
you
need
a
vacation
robert
.
the
past
year
had
taken
a
heavy
toll
on
him
but
he
did
n't
appreciate
seeing
proof
in
the
mirror
.
his
usually
sharp
blue
eyes
looked
hazy
and
drawn
tonight
.
a
dark
stubble
was
shrouding
his
strong
jaw
and
dimpled
chin
.
around
his
temples
the
gray
highlights
were
advancing
making
their
way
deeper
into
his
thicket
of
coarse
black
hair
.
although
his
female
colleagues
insisted
the
gray
only
accentuated
his
bookish
appeal
langdon
knew
better
.
if
boston
magazine
could
see
me
now
.
last
month
much
to
langdon
's
embarrassment
boston
magazine
had
listed
him
as
one
of
that
city
's
top
ten
most
intriguing
peopleâa
dubious
honor
that
made
him
the
brunt
of
endless
ribbing
by
his
harvard
colleagues
.
tonight
three
thousand
miles
from
home
the
accolade
had
resurfaced
to
haunt
him
at
the
lecture
he
had
given
.
``
ladies
and
gentlemen
.
.
.
''
the
hostess
had
announced
to
a
full-house
at
the
american
university
of
paris
's
pavillon
dauphine
``
our
guest
tonight
needs
no
introduction
.
he
is
the
author
of
numerous
books
the
symbology
of
secret
sects
the
art
of
the
illuminati
the
lost
language
of
ideograms
and
when
i
say
he
wrote
the
book
on
religious
iconology
i
mean
that
quite
literally
.
many
of
you
use
his
textbooks
in
class
.
''
the
students
in
the
crowd
nodded
enthusiastically
.
``
i
had
planned
to
introduce
him
tonight
by
sharing
his
impressive
curriculum
vitae
however
.
.
.
''
she
glanced
playfully
at
langdon
who
was
seated
onstage
.
``
an
audience
member
has
just
handed
me
a
far
more
shall
we
say
.
.
.
intriguing
introduction
.
''
she
held
up
a
copy
of
boston
magazine
.
langdon
cringed
.
where
the
hell
did
she
get
that
the
hostess
began
reading
choice
excerpts
from
the
inane
article
and
langdon
felt
himself
sinking
lower
and
lower
in
his
chair
.
thirty
seconds
later
the
crowd
was
grinning
and
the
woman
showed
no
signs
of
letting
up
.
``
and
mr.
langdon
's
refusal
to
speak
publicly
about
his
unusual
role
in
last
year
's
vatican
conclave
certainly
wins
him
points
on
our
intrigue-o-meter
.
''
the
hostess
goaded
the
crowd
.
``
would
you
like
to
hear
more
''
the
crowd
applauded
.
somebody
stop
her
langdon
pleaded
as
she
dove
into
the
article
again
.
``
although
professor
langdon
might
not
be
considered
hunk-handsome
like
some
of
our
younger
awardees
this
forty-something
academic
has
more
than
his
share
of
scholarly
allure
.
his
captivating
presence
is
punctuated
by
an
unusually
low
baritone
speaking
voice
which
his
female
students
describe
as
'chocolate
for
the
ears
.
''
the
hall
erupted
in
laughter
.
langdon
forced
an
awkward
smile
.
he
knew
what
came
nextâsome
ridiculous
line
about
``
harrison
ford
in
harris
tweed
''
âand
because
this
evening
he
had
figured
it
was
finally
safe
again
to
wear
his
harris
tweed
and
burberry
turtleneck
he
decided
to
take
action
.
``
thank
you
monique
''
langdon
said
standing
prematurely
and
edging
her
away
from
the
podium
.
``
boston
magazine
clearly
has
a
gift
for
fiction
.
''
he
turned
to
the
audience
with
an
embarrassed
sigh
.
``
and
if
i
find
which
one
of
you
provided
that
article
i
'll
have
the
consulate
deport
you
.
''
the
crowd
laughed
.
``
well
folks
as
you
all
know
i
'm
here
tonight
to
talk
about
the
power
of
symbols
.
.
.
''
â
the
ringing
of
langdon
's
hotel
phone
once
again
broke
the
silence
.
groaning
in
disbelief
he
picked
up
.
``
yes
''
as
expected
it
was
the
concierge
.
``
mr.
langdon
again
my
apologies
.
i
am
calling
to
inform
you
that
your

is
now
en
route

your
room

i
thought
i
should
alert
you

''
langdon
was
wide
awake
now
.
``
you
sent
someone
to
my
room
''
''
i
apologize
monsieur
but
a
man
like
this
.
.
.
i
can
not
presume
the
authority
to
stop
him
.
''
``
who
exactly
is
he
''
but
the
concierge
was
gone
.
almost
immediately
a
heavy
fist
pounded
on
langdon
's
door
.
uncertain
langdon
slid
off
the
bed
feeling
his
toes
sink
deep
into
the
savonniere
carpet
.
he
donned
the
hotel
bathrobe
and
moved
toward
the
door
.
``
who
is
it
''
''
mr.
langdon
i
need
to
speak
with
you
.
''
the
man
's
english
was
accentedâa
sharp
authoritative
bark
.
``
my
name
is

''
langdon
paused
.
the
judicial
police
the
dcpj
were
the
rough
equivalent
of
the
u.s.
fbi
.
leaving
the
security
chain
in
place
langdon
opened
the
door
a
few
inches
.
the
face
staring
back
at
him
was
thin
and
washed
out
.
the
man
was
exceptionally
lean
dressed
in
an
official-looking
blue
uniform
.
``
may
i
come
in
''
the
agent
asked
.
langdon
hesitated
feeling
uncertain
as
the
stranger
's
sallow
eyes
studied
him
.
``
what
is
this
is
all
about
''
''
my
capitaine
requires
your
expertise
in
a
private
matter
.
''
``
now
''
langdon
managed
.
``
it
's
after
midnight
.
''
``
am
i
correct
that
you
were
scheduled
to
meet
with
curator
of
the
louvre
this
evening
``
langdon
felt
a
sudden
surge
of
uneasiness
.
he
and
the
revered
curator
jacques
sauniãre
had
been
slated
to
meet
for
drinks
after
langdon
's
lecture
tonight
but
sauniãre
had
never
shown
up
.
``
yes
.
how
did
you
know
that
''
''
we
found
your
name
in
his
daily
planner
.
''
``
i
trust
nothing
is
wrong
''
the
agent
gave
a
dire
sigh
and
slid
a
polaroid
snapshot
through
the
narrow
opening
in
the
door
.
when
langdon
saw
the
photo
his
entire
body
went
rigid
.
``
this
photo
was
taken
less
than
an
hour
ago
.
inside
the
louvre
.
''
as
langdon
stared
at
the
bizarre
image
his
initial
revulsion
and
shock
gave
way
to
a
sudden
upwelling
of
anger
.
``
who
would
do
this
''
''
we
had
hoped
that
you
might
help
us
answer
that
very
question
.
considering
your
knowledge
in
symbology
and
your
plans
to
meet
with
him
.
''
langdon
stared
at
the
picture
his
horror
now
laced
with
fear
.
the
image
was
gruesome
and
profoundly
strange
bringing
with
it
an
unsettling
sense
of
deja
vu
.
a
little
over
a
year
ago
langdon
had
received
a
photograph
of
a
corpse
and
a
similar
request
for
help
.
twenty-four
hours
later
he
had
almost
lost
his
life
inside
vatican
city
.
this
photo
was
entirely
different
and
yet
something
about
the
scenario
felt
disquietingly
familiar
.
the
agent
checked
his
watch
.
``
my
captain
is
waiting
sir
.
''
langdon
barely
heard
him
.
his
eyes
were
still
riveted
on
the
picture
.
``
this
symbol
here
and
the
way
his
body
is
so
oddly
.
.
.
''
``
positioned
''
the
agent
offered
.
langdon
nodded
feeling
a
chill
as
he
looked
up
.
``
i
ca
n't
imagine
who
would
do
this
to
someone
.
''
the
agent
looked
grim
.
``
you
do
n't
understand
mr.
langdon
.
what
you
see
in
this
photograph
.
.
.
''
he
paused
.
``

that
to

one
mile
away
the
hulking
albino
named
silas
limped
through
the
front
gate
of
the
luxurious
brownstone
residence
on
rue
la
bruyere
.
the
spiked
cilice
belt
that
he
wore
around
his
thigh
cut
into
his
flesh
and
yet
his
soul
sang
with
satisfaction
of
service
to
the
lord
.

.
his
red
eyes
scanned
the
lobby
as
he
entered
the
residence

empty

he
climbed
the
stairs
quietly
not
wanting
to
awaken
any
of
his
fellow
numeraries
.
his
bedroom
door
was
open
locks
were
forbidden

he
entered
closing

behind
him

the
room
was

a
canvas

in
the
corner

served
as

he
was

visitor
here
this

for
many
years
he
had
been
blessed
with
a
similar
sanctuary
in

provided

tonight
at
last
silas
felt
he
had
begun
to
repay
his
debt

hurrying
to
the
dresser
he
found
the
cell
phone
hidden
in
his
bottom
drawer
and
placed
a
call
to
a
private
extension

answered

silas
relayed
the
earlier
events
of
the
evening
.
.
.
how
all
four
of
his
victims
moments
before
death
had
desperately
tried
to
buy
back
their
godless
lives
by
telling
their
secret
.
each
had
told
silas
the
exact
same
thingâthat
the
keystone
was
ingeniously
hidden
at
a
precise
location
inside
one
of
paris
's
ancient
churchesâthe
eglise
de
saint-sulpice
.
``
inside
a
house
of
the
lord
''
the
teacher
exclaimed
.
``
how
they
mock
us
''
''
as
they
have
for
centuries
.
''
the
teacher
fell
silent
as
if
letting
the
triumph
of
this
moment
settle
over
him
.
finally
he
spoke
.
``
you
have
done
a
great
service
to

.
we
have
waited
centuries
for

you
must

you
understand
the
stakes
.
''
silas
knew
the
stakes
were
incalculable
and
yet
what
the
teacher
was
now
commanding
seemed
impossible
.
``
but
the
cathedral
it
is
a
fortress
.
especially
at
night
.
how
will
i
enter
''
with
the
confident
tone
of
man
of
enormous
influence
the
teacher
explained
what
was
to
be
done
.
â
when
silas
hung
up
the
phone
his
skin
tingled
with
anticipation
.
one
hour
he
told
himself
grateful
that
the
teacher
had
given
him
time
to
carry
out
the
necessary
penance
before
entering
a
house
of
god

must
purge

soul
of
today

sins
.
the
sins
committed
today
had
been
holy

of
war
against
the
enemies
of

been
committed
for
centuries
.
forgiveness
was
assured
.
even
so
silas
knew

required
sacrifice
.
pulling
his
shades
he
stripped
naked
and
knelt
in
the
center
of
his
room
.
looking
down
he
examined
the
spiked
cilice
belt
clamped
around
his
thigh
.
all
true
followers
of
the
way
wore
this
deviceâa
leather
strap
studded
with
sharp
metal
barbs
that
cut
into
the
flesh
as
a
perpetual
reminder
of
christ
's
suffering
.
the
pain
caused
by
the
device
also
helped
counteract
the
desires
of
the
flesh
.
although
silas
already
had
worn
his
cilice
today
longer
than
the
requisite
two
hours
he
knew
today
was
no
ordinary
day
.
grasping
the
buckle
he
cinched
it
one
notch
tighter
wincing
as
the
barbs
dug
deeper
into
his
flesh
.
exhaling
slowly
he
savored
the
cleansing
ritual
of
his
pain
.

silas
whispered
repeating
the
sacred
mantra
of
father
josemaria
escrivaâthe
teacher
of
all
teachers
.
although
escriva
had
died
in
1975
his
wisdom
lived
on
his
words
still
whispered
by
thousands
of
faithful
servants
around
the
globe
as
they
knelt
on
the
floor
and
performed
the
sacred
practice
known
as
``
corporal
mortification

''
silas
turned
his
attention
now
to
a
heavy
knotted
rope
coiled
neatly
on
the
floor
beside
him
.
the
discipline
.
the
knots
were
caked
with
dried
blood
.
eager
for
the
purifying
effects
of
his
own
agony
silas
said
a
quick
prayer
.
then
gripping
one
end
of
the
rope
he
closed
his
eyes
and
swung
it
hard
over
his
shoulder
feeling
the
knots
slap
against
his
back
.
he
whipped
it
over

at

the
da
vinci
code
the
truth
behind
the
code
when
i
took
the
decision
of
sitting
down
and
read
the
book
it
was
because
of
the
high
recommendations
that
it
had
received
from
all
my
friends
and
teachers
.
i
myself
am
not
much
of
a
reader
but
as
soon
as
i
started
reading
the
book
i
just
could
n't
let
go
of
it
.
after
reading
this
book
i
can
certainly
say
that
dan
brown
is
a
true
genius
.
the
da
vinci
code
is
a
masterpiece
.
it
's
one
of
those
books
that
are
unique
and
that
are
always
going
to
be
a
must
read
.
it
starts
out
with
a
murder
case
but
it
is
n't
your
typical
case
of
finding
out
who
it
is
dan
brown
is
sure
of
leaving
more
than
evidence
towards
the
true
secret
behind
this
murder
case
that
has
more
behind
it
than
just
a
guilty
assassin
.
i
assure
you
that
throughout
the
whole
journey
that
the
protagonist
robert
langdon
and
sophie
nevue
undergo
you
will
feel
the
tension
and
the
passion
for
finding
out
the
secret
that
da
vinci
has
left
for
us
.
you
will
feel
nervous
you
will
feel
sad
and
disappointed
when
you
ca
n't
find
out
the
secret
and
you
will
utter
satisfaction
you
will
end
up
with
an
open
mouth
.
it
has
all
the
characteristics
of
a
mysteryadventure
novel
that
will
make
you
enjoy
this
book
as
if
you
're
robert
of
sophie
themselves
.
i
'm
certain
that
you
wo
n't
be
able
to
think
about
anything
else
when
you
're
not
reading
the
book
.
besides
all
this
incredible
characteristics
it
also
has
a
small
dose
of
love
between
the
2
main
characters
that
throughout
the
whole
book
you
can
see
the
obvious
chemistry
that
exist
between
them
.
so
for
all
those
readers
who
like
the
unexpected
this
is
your
book
when
you
're
sure
that
that
's
the
guy
or
that
they
have
solved
the
mystery
i
assure
you
you
will
be
wrong
the
truth
will
blow
your
mind
.
one
of
the
things
that
i
most
enjoyed
was
the
fact
that
several
things
were
happening
at
the
same
time
with
different
characters
the
author
gives
you
just
the
amount
of
information
about
what
's
happening
with
one
character
to
leave
you
hooked
and
then
will
go
and
tell
you
in
the
next
chapter
what
's
happening
with
the
other
characters
and
also
leave
you
hooked
so
you
wo
n't
be
able
to
stop
reading
you
will
read
faster
and
faster
holding
your
breath
to
the
sudden
twists
the
book
takes
and
be
breathless
by
the
end
of
it
.
although
dan
brown
's
literature
as
a
whole
may
not
be
very
good
it
is
apt
for
many
ages
and
great
to
be
read
as
a
fictional
fun
book
that
will
leave
you
with
a
sweet
taste
of
mouth
.
when
finishing
the
da
vinci
code
you
will
want
to
read
more
of
dan
brown
the
da
vinci
code
is
an
amazing
book
and
i
dare
rate
it
without
a
doubt
a
5
star
book
.
what
's
great
about
dan
brown
is
that
he
does
n't
stop
his
masterpiece
here
he
continues
his
extravagant
writing
in
books
like
angels
and
demons
digital
fortress
and
deception
point
so
i
can
say
without
a
doubt
that
dan
brown
is
one
of
top
authors
of
this
age
with
a
creativity
that
is
worth
being
turned
into
a
book
.

totally
unexpected
to
be
honest
reading
a
book
in
my
free
time
never
hit
the
top
of
my
``
to
do
''
list
.
the
davinci
code
by
dan
brown
made
me
want
to
read
more
.
from
this
one
book
i
realized
that
dan
brown
could
transport
you
to
the
world
of
the
holy
grail
.
the
way
the
book
flowed
made
it
seem
like
the
story
took
place
over
a
few
days
.
in
reality
dan
brown
has
written
a
489-page
book
over
the
course
of
24
hours
.
honestly
there
were
n't
many
times
when
i
could
say
``
i
should
stop
reading
if
i
want
to
get
enough
sleep
.
''
every
page
was
filled
with
action-packed
scenes
puzzles
and
interesting
insights
.
there
were
some
things
i
did
n't
like
about
the
book
however
.
throughout
the
book
dan
brown
used
french
words
in
the
dialogue
.
he
does
n't
include
a
glossary
--
well
not
in
the
paperback
edition
at
least
--
and
sometimes
i
have
to
skip
over
the
french
words
or
use
my
imagination
to
figure
out
what
they
mean
.
also
the
descriptions
of
the
louvre
for
instance
seem
like
they
come
out
of
a
travel
brochure
.
honestly
i
did
n't
need
to
know
every
single
detail
of
the
louvre
because
i
saw
it
on
the
internet
before
.
you
should
read
the
davinci
code
if
you
have
an
interest
in
codes
and
puzzles
conspiracies
and
mystery
.
dan
brown
does
an
excellent
job
of
explaining
his
ideas
up
to
the
point
where
a
teenager
can
understand
.
this
is
what
i
like
about
dan
brown
.
he
is
able
to
captivate
his
audience
with
controversial
topics
while
reminding
us
that
his
books
are
fiction
.
i
highly
recommend
this
book
to
people
of
all
ages
and
i
hope
that
you
'll
enjoy
this
book
as
much
as
i
did
.

the

thing
about

is

thankyou
to
the
people
who
've
softly
criticized

's
misrepresentation
of
fact

then
providing
names

books

may

more
words

brown
get
over
it
.
the
book
is
fiction
and
should
be
treated
so
just
like
your
friggin
bible
.
if
brown
believes
the
speculations
he
brought
forth
in
this
book
to
be
true
then
let
him
be
.
who
are
you
to
criticize
him
especially
you
religious
people
who
believe
in
god
.
the
idea
of
god
is
a
speculation
.
oh
yea
thats
right
its
all
about
faith

dan

does
n't
have
the
right
facts
an
enjoyable
book
but
dan
brown
has
twisted
the
facts
about
christianity
in
this
book
.
if
you
look
at
the
real
evidence
you
would
find
that
the

testament
is
true
and
that
jesus
was
never

i
also
recommend
the
hoax
from
the
50's
i
do
n't
know
which
is
worse
brown
's
writing
or
the
fact
that
he
based
the
book
on
something
that
was
proven
to
be
a
total
hoax
.
it
boogles
the
mind
that
brown
stands
behind
the
material
as
factual
when
there
is
direct
evidence
that
story
was
a
hoax
.
if
you
do
any
real
background
research
you
'll
find
out
quickly
that
the
priory
of
scion
was
an
organization
created
by
3
frenchmen
in
the
1950
's
.
the
individuals
who
pulled
this
prank
freely
admit
they
did
this
as
a
joke
and
never
expected
it
to
go
so
far
.
enter
dan
brown
a
second
class
writer
who
falls
for
a
previously
disclosed
hoax
.
i
can
not
believe
that
so
many
people
mainly
americans
bought
right
in
to
an
openly
fabricated
story
.
on
top
of
the
story
being
completely
fictional
the
writing
style
is
dreadful
.
do
yourself
a
favor
and
read
something
by
a
legitimate
writer
you
'll
be
better
entertained
.

mindless

but
addictive
this

is
a

but
...
as
you
read
this
nonsense
you
'll
feel
more

you
'll

close

...
unfortunately
many
maybe
most
of
brown
's
'facts

are
inventions

half-truths

so
there
is

in

there
's
less

zero
because
you
'll

..
brown
need
n't
parade
fiction

that
's
a
disservice
to
the

also
to
brown
's
profession
which
should
not
add
to
the

's

where
the

entertainment

da

do
not
judge
this

by
its
cover
when
i

i
was
pulled
in
from
the
instant

exciting
sequences

kept
me

mixed
with
descriptive
words
details
and
great

i
at
times
felt

i
was
in
the
book

although
the
book
was
suspenseful

exciting
sometimes
the
pages
dragged
on
leaving
me
confused

i
like
the
characters
brown
used
.
they
were
creative
and
witty
.
the
da

code
has
a
great
plot
and
an
interesting
climax

this
book
is
not
recommended
for
religious
christans
who
would
be
offended
by
its
content
or
young
children
because
of
its

level

this

would
leave

more
from
this
reviewer
the
da
vinci
code
this
book
was
recommended
to
me
and
i
thought
that
dan
brown
created
a
genius
story
.
the
da
vinci
code
had
a
very
good
flow
in
literature
and
had
many
twists
that
were
unpredictable
.
one
of
the
twists
that
i
loved
was
when
remy
was
really
working
with
aringarosa
.
brown
showed
interesting
detail
and
the
main
topic
was
very
addicting
and
i
found
it
hard
to
put
the
book
down
.
at
first
i
thought
this
novel
was
boring
but
then
the
conflict
came
up
and
i
was
caught
up
in
the
action
.
brown
has
a
way
to
describe
things
very
efficiently
.
he
changes
the
point
of
view
to
show
how
each
character
feels
about
what
is
going
on
.
there
was
a
point
in
the
story
when
i
thought
that
it
had
been
concluded
but
action
started
to
pour
out
and
i
soon
realized
i
was
wrong
.
what
really
caught
my
attention
in
this
book
was
that
it
never
seemed
to
drag
on
with
only
one
topic
.
events
kept
happening
right
after
each
other
and
that
seemed
to
make
the
da
vinci
code
so
amazing
.
brown
probably
should
n't
recommend
this
story
to
religious
christians
because
it
really
was
against
it
almost
too
much
.
i
would
n't
recommend
it
to
younger
kids
because
of
the
maturity
level
.
i
however
still
found
it
very
captivating
and
i
felt
lost
in
the
words
in
the
da
vinci
code
.
overall
i
could
honestly
say
this
has
been
one
of
my
favorite
books
of
all
time
.

the
da
vinci
code
.
by
dan
brown
the
da
vinci
code
is
a
gripping
adventure
story
.
i
especially
enjoy
how
dan
brown
starts
the
book
.
i
was
recommended
to
read
this
book
by
a
friend
of
mine
.
brown
goes
very
in-depth
and
does
n't
miss
a
single
detail
.
quite
frankly
i
wish
he
had
written
more
.
i
also
must
say
this
.
if
you
read
this
book
you
must
read
the
prologue
.
it
sets
up
the
entire
story
.
when
i
first
heard
of
this
story
i
was
skeptical
about
reading
it
.
then
one
of
my
friends
recommended
it
to
me
and
i
decided
to
read
it
.
i
am
now
glad
that
i
did
.
it
made
me
feel
smart
and
even
want
to
study
some
of
da
vinci
's
artwork
a
little
harder
each
time
i
see
it
.
he
did
drag
on
in
some
parts
so
it
's
not
one
of
those
books
where
there
's
a
shooting
or
fight
every
other
page
.
but
there
's
still
plenty
of
action
.
i
very
highly
recommend
reading
the
da
vinci
code
.

lukewarm
about
'da
vinci'
is
it
possible
to
give
this
book
a
middling
rating
rather
than
go
to
one
extreme
or
another
sure
.
here
's
why
for
starters
the
book
is
in
fact
a
page
turner
.
once
i
started
reading
it
i
did
n't
want
to
stop
.
why
because
every
chapter
leaves
you
hanging
on
the
edge
waiting
for
the
next
step
in
the
adventure
.
while
that
is
effective
at
keeping
a
reader
involved
it
also
left
me
feeling
like
i
was
being
strung
along
and
that
the
pay-off
could
n't
measure
up
to
the
expectation
.
i
was
right
.
it
did
n't
.
'the
da
vinci
code
'
is
altogether
entertaining
and
subsequently
altogether
forgettable
.
it
's
actually
been
over
a
year
since
i
read
the
book
and
if
it
had
n't
been
for
the
movie
refreshing
my
memory
a
bit
i
would
have
forgotten
most
of
the
major
plot
points
by
now
.
the
only
parts
that
stuck
with
me
were
dan
brown
's
antagonistic
flogging
of
christian
doctrine
without
any
real
basis
for
the
wild
claims
he
was
making
and
the
image
of
an
ascetic
albino
murderous
monk
.
silas
was
much
more
memorable
than
any
of
the
protagonists
.
oh
i
also
enjoyed
the
descriptions
of
rosslyn
chapel
although
that
is
mostly
because
i
am
interested
in
anything
dealing
with
scottish
history
.
that
's
about
it
.
the
characters
are
mostly
forgettable
because
brown
moves
so
quickly
through
the
story
that
there
is
no

if
you
must
read
something
by
dan
brown
'angels
and
demons
'
is
better
.
better
plot
progression
more
vivid
locations
more
exciting
climax
more
bewildering
plot
twists
and
a
little
less
sacrilegious
although
even
more
abrasive
toward
catholicism
particularly
the
vatican
.
characters
remain
on
the
shallow
side
.
if
you
choose
to
buy
either
of
brown
's
langdon
series
books
get
the
illustrated
editions
.
i
might
not
have
even
bothered
to
read
them
without
the
pictures
...
they
add
to
the
story
immensely
.
having
said
all
that
i
will
probably
read
brown
's
next
langdon
novel
.
i
am
curious
what
he
is
going
to
do
with
freemasonry
.
perhaps
he
will
also
take
time
to
give
robert
langdon
some
backstory
and
provide
him
with
a
few
friendly
human
links
that
extend
beyond
the
scope
of
the
manic
plot
and
his
arcane
life
of
academia
.
