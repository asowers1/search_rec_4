the
three
most
important
aspects
of
a
tale
of
two
cities
a
tale
of
two
cities
is
told
from
the
omniscient
or
all-knowing
point
of
view
.
the
narrator
or
storyteller
who
is
never
identified
has
access
to
the
thoughts
and
feelings
of
all
the
characters
.
a
tale
of
two
cities
which
is
one
of
two
historical
novels
written
by
charles
dickens
is
set
in
london
and
in
paris
and
the
french
countryside
at
the
time
of
the
french
revolution
.
the
book
is
sympathetic
to
the
overthrow
of
the
french
aristocracy
but
highly
critical
of
the
reign
of
terror
that
followed
.
dickens
characterizes
the
men
and
women
who
populate
a
tale
of
two
cities
less
by
what
the
book
's
narrator
or
the
characters
themselves
say
and
more
by
what
they
do
.
as
a
result
the
novel
seems
somewhat
modern
despite
being
set
in
the
18th
century
and
written
in
the
19th
century
