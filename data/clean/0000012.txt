overviewedit
the
little
prince
is
a
poetic
tale
with
watercolour
illustrations
by
the
author
in
which
a
pilot
stranded
in
the
desert
meets
a
young
prince
fallen
to
earth
from
a
tiny
asteroid
.
the
story
is
philosophical
and
includes
social
criticism
remarking
on
the
strangeness
of
the
adult
world
.
it
was
written
during
a
period
when
saint-exupãry
fled
to
north
america
subsequent
to
the
fall
of
france
during
the
second
world
war
witnessed
first
hand
by
the
author
and
captured
in
his
memoir
flight
to
arras.11
the
adult
fable
according
to
one
review
is
actually
``
...
an
allegory
of
saint-exupãry
's
own
lifeâhis
search
for
childhood
certainties
and
interior
peace
his
mysticism
his
belief
in
human
courage
and
brotherhood
...
.
but
also
an
allusion
to
the
tortured
nature
of
their
relationship
.
``
12
though
ostensibly
styled
as
a
children
's
book
the
little
prince
makes
several
observations
about
life
and
human
nature.13
for
example
saint-exupãry
tells
of
a
fox
meeting
the
young
prince
during
his
travels
on
earth
.
the
story
's
essence
is
contained
in
the
lines
uttered
by
the
fox
to
the
little
prince
on
ne
voit
bien
qu'avec
le
cåur
.
l'essentiel
est
invisible
pour
les
yeux
.
``
one
sees
clearly
only
with
the
heart
.
what
is
essential
is
invisible
to
the
eyes
.
``
14
other
key
thematic
messages
are
articulated
by
the
fox
such
as
tu
deviens
responsable
pour
toujours
de
ce
que
tu
as
apprivoisã
.
``
you
become
responsible
forever
for
what
you
have
tamed
.
''
and
c'est
le
temps
que
tu
as
perdu
pour
ta
rose
qui
fait
ta
rose
si
importante
.
``
it
is
the
time
you
have
lost
for
your
rose
that
makes
your
rose
so
important
.
''
the
fox
's
messages
are
arguably
the
book
's
most
famous
quotations
because
they
deal
with
human
relationships
.
plotedit
a
live
stage
musical
adaptation
of
the
little
prince
at
the
trilingual
lycãe
antoine
de
saint-exupãry
in
santiago
chile
2011
.
the
narrator
explains
that
as
a
young
boy
he
once
drew
a
picture
of
a
boa
constrictor
with
an
elephant
digesting
in
its
stomach
however
every
adult
who
saw
the
picture
would
mistakenly
interpret
it
as
a
drawing
of
a
hat
.
whenever
the
narrator
would
try
to
correct
this
confusion
he
was
ultimately
advised
to
set
aside
drawing
and
take
up
a
more
practical
or
mature
hobby
.
the
narrator
laments
the
lack
of
creative
understanding
displayed
by
adults
.
now
an
adult
himself
the
narrator
has
become
a
pilot
and
one
day
his
plane
crashes
in
the
sahara
desert
far
from
civilization
.
here
the
narrator
is
suddenly
greeted
by
a
young
boy
or
small
man
whom
he
refers
to
as
``
the
little
prince
''
.
the
little
prince
asks
the
narrator
to
draw
a
sheep
.
the
narrator
first
shows
him
his
old
picture
of
the
elephant
inside
the
snake
which
to
the
narrator
's
surprise
the
prince
interprets
correctly
.
after
a
few
failed
attempts
at
drawing
a
good-looking
sheep
the
narrator
simply
draws
a
box
in
his
frustration
claiming
that
the
box
holds
a
sheep
inside
.
again
to
the
narrator
's
surprise
the
prince
exclaims
that
this
is
exactly
the
picture
he
wanted
.
the
narrator
says
that
the
prince
has
a
strange
habit
of
avoiding
directly
answering
any
of
the
narrator
's
questions
.
the
prince
is
described
as
having
golden
hair
a
scarf
and
a
lovable
laugh
.
over
the
course
of
eight
days
stranded
in
the
desert
as
the
narrator
attempts
to
repair
his
plane
the
little
prince
recounts
the
story
of
his
life
.
the
prince
begins
by
describing
life
on
his
tiny
home
planet
in
effect
an
asteroid
the
size
of
a
house
which
the
narrator
believes
to
be
the
one
known
as
b-612
.
the
asteroid
's
most
prominent
features
are
three
minuscule
volcanoes
two
active
and
one
dormant
or
extinct
as
well
as
a
variety
of
plants
.
the
prince
describes
spending
his
earlier
days
cleaning
the
volcanoes
and
weeding
out
certain
unwanted
seeds
and
sprigs
that
infest
his
planet
's
soil
in
particular
pulling
out
baobab
trees
that
are
constantly
trying
to
grow
and
overrun
the
surface
.
the
prince
appears
to
want
a
sheep
to
eat
such
undesirable
plants
until
the
narrator
informs
him
that
a
sheep
will
even
eat
roses
with
thorns
.
upon
hearing
this
the
prince
tells
of
his
love
for
a
mysterious
rose
that
suddenly
began
growing
on
the
asteroid
's
surface
some
time
ago
.
the
prince
says
he
nourished
the
rose
and
listened
to
her
when
she
told
him
to
make
a
screen
or
glass
globe
to
protect
her
from
the
cold
wind
.
although
the
prince
fell
in
love
with
the
rose
he
also
began
to
feel
that
she
was
taking
advantage
of
him
and
he
resolved
to
leave
the
planet
to
explore
the
rest
of
the
universe
.
although
the
rose
finally
apologized
for
her
vanity
and
the
two
reconciled
she
encouraged
him
to
go
ahead
with
his
journey
and
so
he
traveled
onward
.
the
prince
has
since
visited
six
other
asteroids
each
of
which
was
inhabited
by
a
foolish
narrow-minded
adult
including
a
king
with
no
subjects
a
conceited
man
who
believed
himself
the
most
admirable
person
on
his
otherwise
uninhabited
planet
a
drunkard
who
drank
to
forget
the
shame
of
being
a
drunkard
a
businessman
who
endlessly
counted
the
stars
and
absurdly
claimed
to
own
them
all
a
lamplighter
who
mindlessly
extinguished
and
relighted
a
lamp
every
single
minute
and
an
elderly
geographer
so
wrapped
up
in
theory
that
he
never
actually
explored
the
world
that
he
claimed
to
be
mapping
.
when
the
geographer
asked
the
prince
to
describe
his
home
the
prince
mentioned
the
rose
and
the
geographer
explained
that
he
does
not
record
``
ephemeral
''
things
such
as
roses
.
the
prince
was
shocked
and
hurt
by
this
revelation
since
the
rose
was
of
great
importance
to
him
on
a
personal
level
.
the
geographer
recommended
that
the
prince
next
visit
the
planet
earth
.
one
of
numerous
stage
adaptations
of
saint-exupãry
's
child
and
adult
fable
this
one
at
the
university
of
minnesota
's
rarig
center
proscenium
2010
.
on
earth
the
prince
landed
in
the
desert
leading
him
to
believe
that
earth
was
uninhabited
.
he
then
met
a
yellow
snake
that
claimed
to
have
the
power
to
return
him
to
his
home
if
he
ever
wished
to
return
.
the
prince
next
met
a
desert
flower
who
told
him
that
she
had
only
seen
a
handful
of
men
in
this
part
of
the
world
and
that
they
had
no
roots
letting
the
wind
blow
them
around
and
living
hard
lives
.
after
climbing
the
highest
mountain
he
had
ever
seen
the
prince
hoped
to
see
the
whole
of
earth
thus
finding
the
people
however
he
saw
only
the
enormous
desolate
landscape
.
when
the
prince
called
out
his
echo
answered
him
which
he
interpreted
as
the
mocking
voices
of
others
.
eventually
the
prince
encountered
a
whole
row
of
rosebushes
becoming
downcast
at
having
once
thought
that
his
own
rose
was
unique
.
he
began
to
feel
that
he
was
not
a
great
prince
at
all
as
his
planet
contained
only
three
tiny
volcanoes
and
a
flower
that
he
now
thought
of
as
common
.
he
lay
down
in
the
grass
and
wept
until
a
fox
came
along
.
the
fox
desired
to
be
tamed
and
explained
to
the
prince
that
his
rose
really
was
indeed
unique
and
special
because
she
was
the
object
of
the
prince
's
love
.
the
fox
also
explained
that
in
a
way
the
prince
had
tamed
the
rose
and
that
this
is
why
the
prince
was
now
feeling
so
responsible
for
her
.
the
prince
then
took
time
to
tame
the
fox
though
the
two
ultimately
parted
ways
teary-eyed
.
the
prince
next
came
across
a
railway
switchman
who
told
him
how
passengers
constantly
rushed
from
one
place
to
another
aboard
trains
never
satisfied
with
where
they
were
and
not
knowing
what
they
were
after
only
the
children
among
them
ever
bothered
to
look
out
the
windows
.
a
merchant
then
talked
to
the
prince
about
his
product
a
pill
that
eliminated
thirst
which
was
very
popular
saving
people
fifty-three
minutes
a
week
.
the
prince
replied
that
he
would
instead
gladly
use
that
extra
time
to
go
around
finding
fresh
water
.
back
in
the
present
moment
it
is
the
eighth
day
after
the
narrator
's
plane-crash
and
the
narrator
is
dying
of
thirst
fortunately
he
and
the
prince
together
find
a
well
.
the
narrator
later
finds
the
prince
talking
to
the
snake
discussing
his
return
home
and
eager
to
see
his
rose
again
who
he
worries
has
been
left
to
fend
for
herself
.
the
prince
bids
an
emotional
farewell
to
the
narrator
and
states
that
if
it
looks
as
though
he
has
died
it
is
only
because
his
body
was
too
heavy
to
take
with
him
to
his
planet
.
the
prince
warns
the
narrator
not
to
watch
him
leave
as
it
will
make
him
upset
.
the
narrator
realizing
what
will
happen
refuses
to
leave
the
prince
's
side
the
prince
consoles
the
narrator
by
saying
that
he
only
need
look
at
the
stars
to
think
of
the
prince
's
lovable
laughter
and
that
it
will
seem
as
if
all
the
stars
are
laughing
.
the
prince
then
walks
away
from
the
narrator
and
allows
the
snake
to
bite
him
falling
without
making
a
sound
.
the
next
morning
the
narrator
tries
to
look
for
the
prince
but
is
unable
to
find
his
body
.
the
story
ends
with
the
narrator
's
drawing
of
the
landscape
where
the
prince
and
the
narrator
met
and
where
the
snake
took
the
prince
's
life
.
the
narrator
requests
that
anyone
in
that
area
encountering
a
small
man
who
refuses
to
answer
questions
should
contact
the
narrator
immediately
.
tone
and
writing
styleedit
the
story
of
the
little
prince
is
recalled
in
a
sombre
measured
tone
by
the
pilot-narrator
in
memory
of
his
small
friend
``

memorial
to

just
to
the
prince
but
also
to
the
time
the
prince
and

narrator
had
together
''
.15
the
little
prince
was
created
when
saint-exupãry
was
``
...
an
expatriate
and
distraught
about
what
was
going
on
in
his
country
and
in
the
world
.
``
5
it
was
written
during
his
27
month
sojourn
in
north
america
almost
as
a
sort
of
credo
``
carefully
employing
the
expressions
of
despair
loneliness
and
triumph
throughout
its
plotline
.
``
16
according
to
one
analysis
``
the
story
of
the
little
prince
features
a
lot
of
fantastical
unrealistic
elements
...
you
ca
n't
ride
a

...
the
fantasy
of
the
little
prince
works
because
the
logic
of
the
story
is
based
on
the
imagination
of
children
rather
than
the
strict
realism
of
adults
.

according
to

himself

biographer
paul

wrote
of

``
behind

saint-exupãry

saint-exupãry

this

the

the

the
person
he

is
an
``

saint-exupãry

does
not
say
what
the
word
is
but
experts
believe
it
could
be
``

``

the
novella
thus
takes
a
more
politicized
tack
with
an
anti-war
sentiment

'to
gargle

is
an
informal

of
tasks

some
appeared
as
doll-like
figures
baby

with

and
even
a
figure
similar
to
that
in
robert
crumb
's
later
famous
keep

of
1968
.
in
a
1940
letter
to
a
friend
he
sketched
a
character
with
his
own
thinning
hair
sporting
a
bow
tie
viewed
as
a
boyish
alter-ego
and
he
later
gave
a
similar
doodle
to
elizabeth
reynal
at
his
new
york
publisher
's
office.38
most
often
the
diminutive
figure
was
expressed
as
``

lots
of

baggy
pants
that
were

for

and
with
a
long
scarf
that
whipped

wind
.
usually
the
boy
had
a
puzzled
expression
...
this
boy
saint-exupãry
came
to
think
of
as
``
the
little
prince
''
and
he
was
usually
found
standing
on
top
of
a
tiny
planet
.
most
of
the
time
he
was
alone
sometimes
walking
up
a
path

sometimes
there
was
a

flower
on

.
``
50
his
characters
were
frequently
seen
chasing
butterflies
when
asked
why
they
did
so
saint-exupãry
who
thought
of
the
figures
as
his
alter-egos
replied
that
they
were
actually
pursuing
a
``
realistic
ideal
''
.40
saint-exupãry
eventually
settled
on
the
image
of
the
young
precocious
child
with
curly
blond
hair
an
image
which
would
become
the
subject
of
speculations
as
to
its
source

``

illustration
depicted
the
pilot-narrator
asleep
beside

narrator

that

was
likely
omitted
to
avoid
giving

a
'literalness

that
would
distract
its

of

saint-exupãry
's
prodigious
writings
and
studies
of
literature
sometimes
gripped
him
and
on
occasion
he
continued
his
readings
of
literary
works

colleagues
awaiting

he
circled
the

for

hour
so
that

could
finish

saint-exupãry
frequently
flew
with
a
lined
carnet
notebook
during
his
long
solo
flights
and
some
of
his
philosophical
writings
were
created
during
such
periods
when
he
could
reflect
on
the
world
below
him
becoming
``
enmeshed
in

search
for
ideals

he
translated
into

.
according
to
hoffman
``
anne
morrow
lindbergh
's
fascination
with
saint-ex
was
transparent
in
all
she
wrote
about
him
as
might
be
expected
when
one
aviator-writer
romantic
is
writing
about
another
.
''
saint-exupãry
visited
with
anne
for
two
days
but
spoke
with
charles
lindbergh
who
arrived
home
late
for
an
hour
.
besides
their
vast
differences
on
how
hitler
and
the
european
conflict
should
be
treated
charles
did
not
speak
french
and
saint-exupãry
did
not
speak
english
.
their
discussions
passed
through
anne
's
meager
french
were
somewhat
muted
.
but
the
excited
conversation
between
antoine
and
anne
soon
blossomed
``
like
monster
flowers
''
with
each
finishing
the
other
's
sentences
.
ironically
while
saint-exupãry
would
later
campaign
for
an
early
u.s.
entry
into
the
war
lindbergh
strongly
opposed
american
involvement
in
the
european
war
and
would
favour
a
peace
treaty
with
hitler
similar
to
stalin
's
.
the
meeting
between
the
two
future
p-38
war
pilots
was
termed
``
less
than
a
rousing
success
''
.
moreover
charles
later
became
unhappy
about
his
wife
's
vast
esteem
for
the
french
adventurer
.
''
another
source
states
that
it
was
co-publisher
curtice
hitchcock
who
viewed
the
author
sketches
and
doodles
at
a
supper
party
one
evening
and
then
suggested
writing
a
children
's
book
to
saint-exupãry.50

additional
likely
reason
for
the
publisher
's
encouragement
p.l

the
author
of
the
popular
children

at

third
installment
that
would
be
published
by
a

hitchcock
competitor
in
1943
the

year
as

saint-exupãry
's
u.s.
publisher
pressed
him
to
have
a
competing
children
's
book
on
the
market
for
christmas
1942
.
saint-exupãry
was
43
the
year
the
fable
was
published
and
44
the
year
he
died
.
he
originally
wrote
the
story
with
43
sunsets
but
posthumous
editions
often
quote
'44
sunsets
'
possibly
in
tribute
.
on
one
of
saint-exupãry
's
flights
his
aircraft
engine
started
failing
.
his
aircraft
mechanic
onboard
later
recalled
that
saint-exupãry
was
completely
nonplussed
``
saint-ex
simply
started
doodling
cartoons
which
he
handed
back
to
me
with
a
big
grin

``
12
following
one
of
his
crashes
in
a
sophisticated
single-pilot
spy
aircraft
that
resulted
in
him
being
grounded
saint-exupãry
spared
no
effort
in
his
campaign
to
return
to
active
combat
flying
duty
.
he
utilized
all
his
contacts
and
powers
of
persuasion
to
overcome
his
age
and
physical
handicap
barriers
which
would
have
completely
barred
an
ordinary
patriot
from
serving
as
a
war
pilot
.
instrumental
in
his
reinstatement
was
an
agreement
he
proposed
to
john
phillips
a
fluently
bilingual
life
magazine
correspondent
in
february
1944
where
saint-exupãry
committed
to
``
...
write

i
'll
donate

i
do

you
for
your
publication
if

officer
in

john

mccrary

conveyed
the
life

request
to

eaker
's
approval
for

's
return
to

status
would
be
made
``

not
through
favoritism

through
exception

''
the
brutalized
french
it
was
noted
would
cut
a
german
's
throat
``
...
probably
with
more
relish
than
anybody

''
various
sources
state
that
his
final
flight
was
either
his
seventh
eight
ninth
or
even
his
tenth
covert
reconnaissance
mission
.
he
volunteered
for
almost
every
such
proposed
mission

to
his
squadron
and
protested
fiercely
after
being
grounded
following
his
second
sortie
which
ended
with
a
demolished
p-38
.
his
connections
in
high
places
plus
a
publishing
agreement
with

magazine
were
instrumental
in
having
the
grounding
order
against
him
lifted.71
for
some
time
saint-exupãry
's
friends
colleagues
and
compatriots
were
actively
working
to
keep
the
aging
accident-prone
author
grounded
out
of
harm

way
.
in

the
director
of

350
different

including

a
further
complication
occurred
due
to
saint-exupãry
's
opinions
of
french
general
charles

gaulle
whom
he
held
in

regard
.
even
though
both
men
were
working
to
free
france
from
nazi
occupation
saint-exupãry
saw
de
gaulle
with
apprehension
and
consequently
provided
no
public
support
to
the
general
.
in
response
de
gaulle
struck
back
at
the
author
by
implying
that
the
author
was
a
german
supporter
and
then
had
all
his
literary
works
banned
in
france
's
north
african
colonies
.
saint-exupãry
's
writings
were
with
irony
banned
simultaneously
in
both
occupied
france
and
free
france.9168
although
macaulay
culkin
had
been
earning
approximately
8
million
per
film
project
at
that
point
he
provided
his
narration
to
the
museum
``
...
for
nothing
and
we
are
grateful
for
his
services
''
according
to
a
morgan
representative.109
the
d'gay
portion
of
the
estate
refers
to
saint-exupãry
's
married
sister
.
orson
welles
purchased
the
movie
rights
to
the
story
the
day
after
reading
the
novella
in
a
single
sitting.55
welles
was
unable
to
persuade
walt
disney
to
assist
him
in
turning
his
screenplay
of
the
story
into
a
film
with
disney
fearing
such
a
screen
release
would
upstage
his
own
screen
adaptations
of
other
stories
.
the
signed
copy
is
inscribed
``
for

about

who
perhaps
will
