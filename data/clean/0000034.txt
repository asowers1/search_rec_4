this

concerns
a

of
ten
strangers

all
been
invited
by

.
with
some
insane
number
of
millions
of
copies
sold
worldwide
the
british
author
became
a
major
name
in
the
genre
of
mystery
.
while
the
beginning
of
the
story
is
a
bit
mundane
and
lacks
the
suspense
that
is
abundant
in
the
chapters
to
come
readers
should
not
be
discouraged
and
continue
to
read
past
this
brief
piece
of
boringness
in
order
to
savor
the
rest
of
the
emotion
drenched
and
suspenseful
novel
.
kudos
to
ms.
christie
.
to
anyone
who
so
much
as
enjoyed
this
book
i
reccomend
the
mirror
cracked
from
side
to
side
another
tale
by
agatha
christie
.
it
has
a
voice
much
different
than
that
of
and
then
there
were
none
's
but
all
of
the
rich
classic
and
enigmatic
nature
of
the
the
latter
.

more
from
this
reviewer
an
amazing
thriller
that
i
can
read
over
and
over
again
and
not
get
bored
i
saw
the
play
to
this
book
before
i
read
it
and
i
still
got
chills
reading
it
.
when
agatha
christie
explained
these
characters
i
could
picture
them
extremely
easily
.
it
was
like
a
picture
being
painted
before
my
eyes
.
you
could
tell
that
in
this
book
she
put
major
thought
into
her
characters
.
like
there
personalities
and
how
they
would
act
around
people
and
just
the
thoughts
in
their
heads
when
certain
things
happened
.
it
was
truly
amazing
.
some
of
the
characters
in
the
book
reminded
me
of
the
people
that
i
have
met
throughout
my
life
.
like
philip
lombard
is
like
the
laid
back
``
cool
''
guy
that
cares
more
about
his
reputation
than
anything
else
and
likes
to
be
portrayed
as
the
``
bad
boy
.
''
tony
marston
the
young
heart
throb
that
all
the
girls
wants
to
go
out
with
or
just
wishes
he
would
give
them
the
time
of
day
and
he
knew
he
was
like
that
so
milked
it
for
all
it
was
worth
.
mr.
blore
the
happy
go
lucky
spirit
.
i
am
positive
that
anybody
could
find
a
relation
to
at
least
one
of
the
characters
in
the
story
no
matter
who
you
are
.
the
story
has
some
amazing
twists
that
you
would
never
expect
.
just
when
you
think
you
have
solved
the
mystery
because
all
the
signs
point
to
someone
a
curve
ball
is
thrown
in
like
they
die
or
something
random
.
this
is
definitely
a
thriller
book
.
it
's
and
ending
you
would
not
suspect
in
a
million
years
.
this
book
barely
has
any
dull
spots
you
are
always
at
the
edge
of
your
seat
wondering
who
's
going
to
die
next
who
is
really
the
killer
is
there
more
than
one
killer
will
i
ever
find
out
who
this
person
is
will
anyone
ever
find
them
why
does
n't
help
ever
come
most
of
those
answers
you
wo
n't
find
at
the
end
of
the
book
you
have
to
read
the
epilogue
.
the
epilogue
answers
so
many
questions
it
even
shares
how
the
killer
got
away
with
all
of
its
work
and
how
it
found
all
those
``
innocent
''
people
.
this
book
really
makes
you
think
about
life
.
it
makes
you
wonder
if
you
could
really
trust
the
people
around
you
.
it
really
makes
you
wonder
if
people
are
always
what
they
appear
to
be
if
they
are
hiding
something
.
i
guess
we
will
never
know
but
i
do
know
that
and
then
there
were
none
is
by
far
one
of
the
greatest
mystery
book
i
have
ever
read
in
y
life
.

and
then
there
were
none
this
book
starts
with
ten
strangers
invited
to
the
well-known
indian
island
by
a
u
n
owen
.
in
all
of
the
guests
rooms
there
is
a
poem
called
ten
little
indians
.
all
of
the
guests
then
go
down
to
dinner
.
a
record
on
the
gramophone
says
each
of
the
guests
is
guilty
of
a
murder
.
the
guests
then
slowly
begin
to
die
after
telling
the
truth
about
the
recording
.
not
only
do
they
die
but
the
deaths
follow
a
pattern
.
the
people
on
the
island
then
try
to
figure
out
who
is
the
murderer
.
this
book
is
full
of
mystery
and
suspense
.
i
recommend
it
even
for
people
who
dont
normally
read
mystery
books
.
it
will
keep
you
turning
pages
until
the
end
.

i
got
this
on
my
nook

i
think
that
the
way
christie
plans
the
whole
thing
out
is
spectacular
.
the
plot
of
the
story
os
that
ten
people
arrive
on
an
island
with
no
idea
of
where
or
who
their
employer

u

write

if
someone

they

best
agatha
christie
novel
this
is
not
for
immature
readers
.
it
has
an
extremely
complex
plot
with
twists
and
turns
around
every
corner
.
its
thought
provoking
and
really
shows
how
skilled
agatha
christie
is
.
it
kept
me
on
edge
the
entire
novel
and
caused
some
sleepless
nights
.
truely
a
masterpiece
and
must
read
for
any
true
mystery
fan
.

my
review
i
have
read
several
christie
books
and
this
one
is
by
far
my
favorite
unlike
most
books
this
one
was
suspenseful
throughout
and
kept
my
attention
.
i
have
to
say
this
book
is
much
like
the
movie
or
board
game
clue
.
it
has
an
amazing
ending
and
i
reccomend
it
highly
.

original
words
left

giving
up
on
it

i
have
tried
many
times
to
read
this
book
and
have
failed
each
and
every
one
.
i
find
the
writting
to
be

hard

follow

as
for
the
story
well
i
ca
n't
comment
since
i
have
n't
read
it
through
.
it
does
seem
to
drag
along
though
.
anyway
i
would
n't
recommend
this
to
anyone
and
feel
i
wasted
my
money

i
am
afraid
that
i
did

i
am
one
of
the
hugest
fans
of
agatha
christie
.
i
have
read
almost
6
books
of
hers
.
three
of
them
i
have
read
more
than
twice
.
she
is
a
true
writing
goddess
.
it
is
still
impossible
to
believe
that
she
was
able
to
write
so
many
novels
and
none
of
them
are
replicates
of
each
other
.
may
her
soul
rest
in
peace
...
writing
this
review
is
really
confusing
since
the
book
contains
of
so
many
characters
.
mr.

macarthur
mr.

mr.
blore
mr.
lombard
mr.
rogers
mrs.

ms.
brint
ms.
vera
and
dr.
armstrong
are
all
invited
to
the
mansion
of
indian
island
in
devon
.
each
one
of
them
has
been
invited
based
on
a
different
reason
.
they
do
n't
know
each
other
at
all
but
one
thing
they
all
have
in
common
is
they
were
all
invited
by
one
man
named
u.
n.
owen
.
when
they
arrive
on
the
island
things
start
to
get
creepy
.
mr.
owen
and
ms.
owen
have
not
arrived
yet
.
when
the
10
guests
decide
to
rest
they
find
out
that
there
is
the
nursery
rhyme
quot10
little
indian
boysquot
hanged
over
all
the
fireplaces
in
each
of
their
bedrooms
.
and
in
the
evening
a
voice
on
the
gramophone
accuses
each
one
of
them
of
killing
somebody
.
and
the
voice
knows
the
exact
date
of
each
murder
.
the
10
guests
are
not
scared
yet
.
tomorrow
they
can
leave
the
island
on
the
boat
.
but
when
tomorrow
is
here
they
realize
that
the
boat
is
not
coming
at
all
.
things
start
to
get
deadly
.
someone
is
killing
them
one
by
one
in
the
style
of
the
nursery
rhyme
quot10
little
indian
boysquot
.
they
are
all
starting
to
get
mad
.
they
should
find
a
way
to
leave
the
island
because
the
only
other
choice
is
getting
killed
...
who
is
the
killer
have
these
10
people
really
killed
somebody
in
some
stage
in
their
lives
knowingly
or
not
find
out
when
you
read
this
horribly-scary
story
of
justice-seekers
secrets
and
survival
and
then
there
were
none
.
this
story
was
really
scary
.
i
had
a
really
hard
time
trying
to
find
the
killer
.
no
matter
how
much
i
guessed
it
always
turned
out
wrong
way
wrong
.
i
got
so
frustrated
.
and
when
i
finally
found
out
i
was
like
quotwhat
who
seriouslyquot
it
was
totally
utterly
unexpected
.
i
am
sure
that
the
shock
registered
on
the
faces
of
people
who
read
this
is
exactly
what
agatha
christie
was
hoping
for
.
i
love
how
the
plot
played
out
.
i
love
thrillers
and
mysteries
.
the
joy
of
finding
out
who
is
behind
something
is
truly
one
of
a
kind
.
do
n't
you
think
if
you
want
a
scary
read
that
you
will
not
be
able
to
put
down
until
the
last
page
then
and
then
there
were
none
is
the
one
for
you
and
you
especially
you

the
lonely
indian
island
.
slowly
each
of
them
was
murdered
according
to
an
old
indian
nursery
poem
.
but
who
is
the
murderer
the
writing
style
of
this
book
was
very
interesting
to
me
.
in
every
chapter
there
were
smaller
chapters
that
focused
on
one
single
person
's
perspective
.
with
this
style
you
were
able
to
understand
and
perceive
things
through
that
certain
persons
eyes
.
i
think
at
the
beginning
of
the
book
its
was
very
confusing
because
you
had
absolutely
no
idea
who
these
people
were
and
you
were
n't
used
to
seeing
things
the
way
the
do
you
did
n't
know
their
personalities
.
i
t
was
also
confusing
because
there
was
so
many
guy
characters
.
it
was
easy
to
keep
the
two
girls
strait
but
very
hard
for
the
boys
because
after
awhile
all
of
their
names
seemed
similar
and
they
all
act
alike
.
i
liked
this
book
.
i
recommend
you
read
this
if
you
are
into
the
mysterious
murder
stories
also
i
would
recommend
young
kids
do
n't
read
it
because
of
the
violence
.
i
rate
this
book
three
stars
out
of
five
.
