while
we
have
an
inception
review
where
you
can
leave
comments
weve
set
up
this
page
as
a
place
where
you
can
discuss
the
inception
ending
and
other
spoilers
without
worrying
about
ruining
the
movie
for
folks
who
havent
seen
it
yet
.
to
help
steer
discussion
weve
added
a
lengthy
analysis
of
inception
especially
the
ending
and
explained
why
our
analysis
of
the
film
fits
with
the
story
christopher
nolan
intended
to
tell
.
does
our
inception
explanation
match
your
theory
find
out
many
people
walked
away
from
inception
impressed
.
some
were
confused
some
were
even
feeling
like
they
had
their
brains
woken
by
the
most
exciting
and
thought-provoking
movie
experience
to
come
along
all
year
.
i
realize
that
most
people
who
saw
inception
have
already
made
up
their
minds
about
what
they
perceived
the
film
to
be
and
nolan
will
undoubtedly
be
proud
of
that
.
however
for
those
of
you
still
looking
for
an
inception
explanation
we
like
to
offer
a
few
thoughts
.
weve
organized
things
by
category
for
you
in
case
youre
more
interested
in
one
facet
of
the
film
than
another
.

inception
ending
explained
-
the
rules
so
the
first
thing
to
talk
about
are
the
rules
of
the
dream
world
nolan
created
for
the
film
.
with
all
the
action
that
happened
onscreen
it
was
easy
to
forget
some
of
the
finer
details
but
once
the
lights
came
up
and
people
had
time
to
think
i
know
the
question
of
who
was
dreaming
which
dreams
certainly
came
up
among
others
questions
as
well
.
remember
the
basic
premise
cobb
the
extractor
and
his
team
are
con
artists
and
like
any
con
artists
their
job
is
to
construct
a
false
reality
and
manipulate
it
in
order
to
confuse
andor
fool
a
mark
in
this
case
industrialist
robert
fischer

by
cillian
murphy

nolan
takes
the
classic
concept
of
a
con
man
a
step
further
by
making
cobb
and
his
team
dream
thieves
but
in
the
end
the
basic
concept
is
still
your
classic
conheist
movie
.
dream
levels
and
dream
time
nolan
throws
a
lot
of
fancy
math
at
you
but
its
all
really
inconsequential
.
all
you
need
to
really
know
are
the
basic
concepts
the
dream
within
a
dream
process
puts
you
into
a
deeper
state
of
dreaming
.
the
deeper
you
go
the
further
removed
your
mind
is
from
reality
.
we
all
know
what
thats
like
the
deeper
you
sleep
the
harder
it
is
to
be
woken
up
and
the
more
vivid
and
real-feeling
a
dream
becomes
.
if
youre
in
a
deep
enough
sleep
not
even
the
usual
physical
ques
to
wake
up
effect
you
such
as
the
sensation
of
falling
the
kick
or
even
say
having
to
go
to
the
bathroom
.
by
the
time
you
reach
the
limbo
state
it
can
be
so
difficult
to
wake
and
the
dream
can
feel
so
vividly
real
that
the
mind
stops
trying
to
wake
at
all
the
mind
accepts
the
dream
as
its
reality
like
slipping
into
a
coma
.
when
you
wake
up
in
limbo
you
dont
remember
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
real
world
as
in
any
dream
you
wake
up
in
the
middle
ofâ
a
scene
and
simply
accept
it
for
what
it
is
.
breaking
yourself
out
of
this
cycle
is
extremely
difficult
which
is
why
cobb
and
his
wife
mal
were
trapped
in
limbo
for
what
seemed
like
decades
.
time
is
the
other
factor
.
the
deeper
you
go
into
a
dream
state
the
faster
your
mind
is
able
to
imagine
and
perceive
things
within
that
dream
state

why

to
pull
off

while
the
van
is
still
falling
through
the

before
the

all
within

in

the
mind
works
so
fast
that

can
be
interpreted
as

from
the

i
think
hes
still

think
about
it
nolan
made
it
a
big
deal
to
tell
us
that
no
one
is
allowed
to
touch
each
others
totem..well
when
cobb
goes
into
limbo
to
find
saito
he
is
brought
in
by
guards
and
they
tell
saito
he
was
found
with
this
and
this
and
they
laid
out
a
pistol
and
cobbs
totem
saito
picked
it
up
which
if
the
whole
thing
is
true
he
would
of
ruined
its
purpose
.
ive
watched
this
movie
seventeen
times
in

month

this

did
a
great
job
with
this
project

okay
well
that
does
make
sense
but.the
kids
are
wearing
different
shoes
.
and
their
ages
are
different..so
it
must
be
reality..

what
you
have
missed
in
the
rule
of
the
totem
though
is
that
you
dont
share
your
totem
with
anybody
in
the
real
world
.
in
a
dream
it
doesnt
matter
because
the
totem
owner
is
still
the
only
person
to
know
the
actual
weight
and
feel
of
the
totem
and
how
it
acts
in
the
real
world
so
it
is
okay
to
share
a
totem
if
you
are
positive
that
you
are
in
a
dream
.
the
other
dreamers
do
not
necessarily
know
that
this
is
your
totem
or
how
it
actually
actsfeelslooksetc
.

the

noooo
see
your
getting
it
all
wrong
.
the
purpose
of
not
letting
someone
touch
your
totem
is
because
if
they
see
every
detail
of
it
they
can
trick
you
you
wont
be
able
to
know
whats
a
dream
or
not
breanna

years

well
if
they
dont
know
that
its
your
totem
then
they
wouldnt
know
to
manipulate
it
to
trick
you
.
if
they
think
its
just
a
random
object
in
you
then
its
useless
to
them
.
also
they
just
found
him
and
brought
him
to
saito
dont
know
how
to
spell
his
name
right
away
so
they
wouldnt
have
had
time
to
change
the
top
.

the
totem
has
its
alternate
effect
in
the
dream
world
controlled
by
the
architect
.
if
the
top
were
spun
in
the
dream
world
it
would
be
the
architects
perception
of
physics
that
would
determine
if
it
spun
continuously
or
fell
.
we
do
however
see
a
couple
of
guns
thought
into
the
dream
world
by
mere
participants
in
the
scene
before
the
van
is
about
to
leave
the
warehouse
.
this
implies
the
participants
have
a
certain
level
of
control
within
the
dream
.
if
this
were
true
the
top
would
spin
if
the
spinner
wanted
it
to
and
could
also
fall
if
they
wanted
it
to
thereby
destroying
the
absolute
notion
of
true
reality
.
we
dont
know
if
dicaprio
remembers
how
he
got
to
the
original
interaction
with
saito
at
the
start
of
the
movie
he
does
perceive
memories
but
none
are
shown
regarding
recent
events
leading
to
that
moment
nor
could
any
be
shown
without
documenting
his
entire
life
.
therefore
any
events
we
consider
ties
to
reality
could
all
have
been
part
of
a
dream
world
from
the
start
.
i
personally
dont
see
any
way
of
knowing
what
is
real
and
what
isnt
.
all
of
the
characters
could
be
projections
in
dicaprios
own
mind
.
he
states
early
on
that
he
is
the
best
extractor
in
the
world
and
later
implies
that
he
is
the
only
one
that
has
achieved
inception
.
how
could
he
definitively
know
this
perhaps
it
is
a
merely
a
brag
session
perhaps
there
is
some
evidence
or
perhaps
it
all
happens
in
his
own
mind
.
it
is
a
bit
far
fetched
to
think
he
would
be
exiled
from
the
us
and
blamed
for
his
wifes
death
when
im
sure
the
investigators
would
be
able
to
determine
that
she
plummeted
from
a
different
building
than
the
one
he
was
standing
in
.
and
her
cleared
psych
evaluations
used
to
confirm
her
claims
of
him
being
a
danger
to
the
children
would
be
discarded
when
they
determined
she
had
committed
suicide
.
but
again
its
a
movie
and
we
dont
know
everything
about
the
world
contained
within
it
so
there
are
no
real
cues
to
follow
to
make
a
determination
of
his
reality
.
he
also
could
be
in
a
massive
delusion
for
whatever
reason
and
we
are
simply
never
subjected
to
the
stimili
outside
of
his
own
mind
.
maybe
he
doesnt
have
kids
maybe
he
never
had
a
wife
maybe
hes
a
fat
guy
in
a
straight
jacket
think
identity
.
look
at
it

you
want

hasnt

in

for
quite
awhile
so
his
father

help

idea

being

that
was
my
take

in
reply
to
archaeon
i
know
how
english
grammar
works
.
i
teach
it
.
i
also
teach
grammar
.
the
difference
between
you
and
me
is
that
i
actually
know
what
i
am
talking
about
.
in
the
sentence
there
are
a
lot
of
people
here
a
lot
of
is
an
idiomatic
expression
.
it
means
a
large
number
of
or
many
.
there
is
also
the
literal
meaning
of
a
lot
of
as
in
he
owns
a
lot
of
land
.
the
expression
could
also
be
used
with
uncountable
nouns
to
mean
a
large
amount
as
in
there
is
a
lot
of
sand
.
people
and
theories
are
counatble
nouns
however
so
there
is
a
lot
of
people
is
obviously
wrong
.
look
you
dont
believe
me
fine
.

are
you
going

argue
now
with

about
what
is
correct
grammar
.
seriously
similarly
a

of
theories
as
in
there
are
a
ton

does
not
literally
mean
theories
measured
out
to

a
ton
of
is
not
seriously
meant
as
a
measure
but
as
an
idiomatic
expression
meaning
in
this
case
a
large
number
.
the
verb-subject
agreement
is
with
the
nound
theories
which
is
clearly
plural
.
it
would
be
as
if
you
said
there
are
a
million
theories

martin
i
hope
youre
more
polite
and
respectful
in
your
classes
than
you
were
at
the
beginning
of
the
above
response
.
i
too
know
my
subject
matter
and
my
chosen
profession
but
i
am
always
willing
to
review
what
ive
said
and
the
particulars
of
a
given
conversation
.
in
this
case
i
went
back
and
looked
at
the
original
statement
the
one
that
started
this
whole
pointless
mess
.
i
also
looked
at
various
classroom
materials
and
online
sources
.
one
thing
i
realized
and
it
amazes
me
that
i
had
let
this
detail
slip
by
is
that
i
never
saw
the
original
statement
.
for
some
odd
reason
i
thought
i
had
but
i
had
only
gone
as
far
back
as
arturos
initial
correction
.
thus
i
must
in
fairness
admit
that
the
original
usage
might
indeed
lend
credence
to
your
perspective
.
this
is
not
to
say
that
my
perspective
is
wrong
however
.
i
did
find
several
sources
that
proved
your
point
admittedly
.
i
did
also
find
a
few
that
gave
weight
to
my
argument
as
well
.
my
mistake
was
in
being
too
general
in
my
definition
of
what
was
being
described
and
expressed
.
the
formalityinformality
of
the
original
statement
its
referents
and
the
point
made
by
the
original
author
and
thus
his
surroundingleading
statements
influenced
the
form
his
sentence
took
.
i
should
have
considered
these
things
instead
of
simply
glomming
on
to
arturos
comment
.
for
that
and
only
that
i
do
apologize
.
otherwise
i
stand
by
what
i
saidwith
the
addendum
that
it
is
not
an
absolute
.
now
can
we
please
drop
what
has
become
a
truly
pointless
off-topic
conversation

back

i
hope
youâre
more
polite
and
respectful
in
your
classes
than
you
were
at
the
beginning
of
the
above
response
.
you
mean
when
i
said
âi
know
how
english
grammar
works
.
i
teach
it.â
oh
wait
that
was
me
quoting
you
.
in
the
future
you
might
want
to
try
being
a
little
less
arrogant
especially
when
you
obviously
havent
bothered
to
check
any
references
to
see
if
what
you
are
saying
is
actually
true
and
not
just
complete
nonsense
.

the
difference
between
you
and
me
is
that
i
actually
know
what
i
am
talking
about
.
that
is
the
statement
to
which
i
was
responding
.
that
is
the
very
definition
of
arrogance
.
i
realized
a
mistake
i
had
made
in
terms
of
my
initial
observation
not
my
conclusion
.
i
attempted
to
correct
my
mistake
or
at
least
to
explain
it
.
i
even
tried
honestly
and
fairly
to
point
out
that
we
both
had
made
valid
points
.
i
did
not
speak
down
to
you
in
my
response
.
i
pity
your
students
if
thats
how
you
behave
in
class
.
act
like
an
ass
if
you
wish
but
you
are
not
worth
any
more
of
my
time
.
martin
2

if
you
were
my
student
i
would
give
you
a
failing
grade
and
yet
you
presume
to
teach
others
and
you
call
me
arrogant
.
i
was
making
a
factual
statement
.
you
didnt
know
what
you
were
talking
about
.
go
cry
to
somebody
else

between
you

no
try
again

between
is
a

you

is

you
not

the

that

when

test
out
the

guys
own

he
wakes
we
see
a
shot
of
him
in
the
bathroom
watching
his
totem
spin
but
someone
interupts
him
and
he
knocks
it
over
himself..so
we
never
know
whether
it
was
going
to
still
spin
or
not..

please
dont
use
terms
like
subconscious
when
you
mean
unconscious
.
subconscious
is
a
made-up
hollywood
idea

real

deals
purely
with

sambo
2
years

ah
it
is
a
made-up
hollywood
movie
dustin
2
years
ago
as
much
as
i
respect
the
well
planned
layout
of
this
site
i
have
problems
with
your
arguments
.
1
.
was
saito
truly
powerful
enough
to
make
one
phone
call
and
end
cobbâs
problems
or
was
that
just
cobb
in
limbo
projecting
his
subconscious
wish
to
go
home
you
can
argue
logistics
all
you
want
but
if
itâs
said
that
saito
is
a
powerful
and
wealthy
man
he
bought
a
whole
airline
on
a
whim
then
thereâs
reason
enough
to
infer
that
he
could
bend
the
legal
system
for
cobb
.
rich
powerful
people
bend
laws
all
the
time
.
you
assume
saito
isnt
a
projection
.
im
arguing
from
the
perspective
that
his
wife
was
indeed
correct
in
believing
that
the
real
world
leonardo
came
back
into
was
still
a
dream
.
did
cobbâs
father
michael
caine
arrange
to
meet
him
at
the
airport
or
is
he
there
because
heâs
cobbâs
projection
at
this
point
weâre
reading
way
too
much
into
things
.
there
is
a
phone
on
the
plane
so
cobb
couldâve
easily
arranged
for
pickup
.
this
was
also
an
intricate
plan
they
were
hatching
so
arranging
for
airport
pickup
would
probably
be
on
the
to-do
list
.
but
yet
one
point
remains
clear
and
is
repeated
.
one
shot
shows
cobb
seeing
his
father
at
the
airport
the
next
shows
him
at
home
with
his
father
.
its
reading
too
much
into
it
to
assume
that
cobb
knew
how
he
actually
got
home
.
in
early
dream
scenes
cobb
is
wearing
a
wedding
band
that
doesnât
appear
in
the
âreal
worldâ
scenes
or
the
end
scenes
in
the
airport
â
does
that
mean
the
ending
is
ârealityâ
details
like
that
are
certainly
strong
evidence
that
there
is
a
real
world
and
that
cobb
does
live
in
it
at
times
â
such
as
when
he
isnât
wearing
a
wedding
band
.
in
a
dream
one
can
manipulate
objects
at
will
sometimes
.
if
he
is
indeed
convinced
that
his
real
world
is
real
then
he
would
perceive
himself
without
the
ring
.
quite
simple
really
.
does
the
fact
that
cobb
uses
malâs
totem
mean
it
doesnât
work
as
a
totem
and
therefore
he
never
knows
if
heâs
in
reality
or
not
again
weâre
reading
a
little
too
deep
into
things
.
the
only
people
who
know
the
weight
and
feel
of
that
totem
are
mal
and
cobb
and
since
mal
is
dead
cobb
is
the
only
one
left
who
knows
the
totemâs
tactile
details
.
so
yes
he
could
certainly
use
it
as
a
measure
of
reality
the
totem
was
not
âruinedâ
by
him
using
it
.
this
also
goes
along
with
the
wedding
ring
.
he
can
manipulate
the
object
all
he
wants
.
what
gives
that
certain
object
any
special
ability
over
any
cup
or
bowl
in
his
dream
especially
if
hes
the
architect
.
at
the
end
cobbâs
kids
seem
to
be
the
same
age
and
are
seemingly
wearing
the
same
clothes
as
they
were
in
his
memory
of
them
â
is
it
âproofâ
heâs
still
dreaming
as
carefully
documented
by
our
own
vic
holtreman
at
the
end
of
the
film
cobbâs
kids
are
wearing
similar
outfits
to
the
ones
he
remembers
but
their
shoes
are
different
.
as
for
their
ages
if
you
check
imdb
there
are
actually
two
set
of
actors
credited
with
playing
cobbâs
kids
.
the
daughter
phillipa
is
credited
as
being
both
3
and
5
years
old
while
the
son
james
is
credited
as
being
both
20
months
and
3
years
old
.
this
suggests
that
while
it
might
be
subtle
there
is
a
difference
between
the
kids
in
cobbâs
memories
and
the
kids
cobb
comes
home
to
.
that
would
suggest
the
homecoming
is
in
fact
âreality.â
but
feel
free
to
debate
that
.
he
can
also
manipulate
what
his
kids
look
like
based
upon
his
own
belief
in
the
dream
.
what
is
clear
though
is
that
the
human
mind
isnt
truly
revolutionary
in
creating
its
own
ideas
.
it
draws
off
previous
or
existing
details
.
so
he
alters
the
shoes
and
ages
big
deal
.
what
is
striking
are
the
similarities
.
will
the
spinning
top
keep
spinning
or
was
it
about
to
fall
over
just
before
nolan
cut
to
black
again
what
does
it
matter
if
hes
the
architect
and
created
every
item
in
the
dream
.
he
can
manipulate
it
all
.
tykjen

years

micheal
caine
was
not
cobbs
father
.
he
was
his
father
in
law
.
he
introduced
mal
and
cobb
to
dreamshare
.
sambo
2
years

nice
round-up
dustin
i
generally
agree
.
dan
2
years
ago
if
mal
created
the
idea
of
a
totem
why
didnt
she
just
spin
it
to
see
if
she
was
in
a
dream
or
reality
before
killing
herself
tykjen
2
years
ago
she
ultimately
understood
that
cobb
found
her
top
in
limbo
and
altered
the
idea
.
she
could
not
break
free
and
had
to
take
a
leap
of
faith
when
waiting
for
the
train
.
and
once
free..the
idea
was
stuck
.
and
that
is
what
an
inception
does
.
it
sticks
in
reality
and
no
matter
how
many
times
she
would
reality
check
herself
it
would
not
matter
since
her
secret
of
the
totem
was
no
longer
a
secret
.
cobb
knew
this
too
and
he
did
not
have
the
heart
to
tell
her
.
he
only
tells
himself
and
ariadne
in
the
end
when
he
comes
clean
about
it
.
sambo
2
years
ago
tyken
at
what
point
did
she
ultimately
understand
that
cobb
altered
her
top
in
limbo
in
response
to
dan
i
think
we
must
assume
she
did
spin
it
.
whether
cobb
ever
tried
it
himself
would
be
another
question
.
but
what
happens
when
she
spins
it
if
it
falls
mal
would
just
look
for
other
excuses
to
support
her
deeply
incepted
beliefs
.
she
even
says
to
cobb
that
their
current
world
seems
real
to
him
only
because
he
believes
it
to
be
real
she
probably
thinks
his
beliefs
are
overriding
hers
here
in
what
she
still
believes
to
be
limbo
or
perhaps
a
dream
level
.
again
the
confusion
concerning
even
this
small
detail
is
intentional
allowing
the
film
to
maintain
its
ambiguity
.
where
did
mal
think
she
was
on
the
otherhand
it
the
top
did
keep
on
spinning
well
ill
let
you
come
to
your
own
conclusions
.
but
if
it
did
imo
it
probably
fell
over
the
second
cobb
ever
entered
the
same
room
where
she
was
spinning
it
.
tykjen
2
years
ago
she
always
knew
i
mean..who
else
could
have
found
out
her
secret
but
cobb
but
she
still
had
to
take
a
leap
of
faith
when
they
escaped
on
the
tracks
.
and
she
gave
him
the
same
ultimatum
when
she
escaped
after
coming
back
to
reality..
sadly
.
sambo
2
years
ago
no
she
didnt
realize
cobb
set
the
totem
spinning
did
she
wasnt
this
inception
cobbs
great
deception
sambo
2
years
ago
mal
would
not
question
finding
it
spinning
not
in
a
dream
weird
stuff
like
that
happens
in
dreams
and
no
doubt
in
limbo
.
tykjen
2
years
ago
she
didnt
even
find
the
totem
spinning
.
once
cobb
spun
it
she
was
already
given
the
idea
that
your
world
is
not
real
.
it
helped
her
escape
limbo
.
but
it
did
the
same
in
reality
too
which
is
something
cobb
couldnt
foresee
as
it
was
the
first
inception
.
and
a
dangerous
idea
to
plant..
tykjen
2
years
ago
happens
in
dreams
is
one
thing
happens
in
dreamshare
is
quite
another
.
and
happening
in
limbo
through
dreamshare
is
a
whole
new
playfield
.
cobb
and
mal
were
gods
in
their
own
world
.
nothing
was
by
chance
down
there
.
mal
knew
this
and
made
a
conscious
choice
to
forget
reality
while
using
dreamshare
.
ultimately
they
were
both
dreamshare
addicts
with
sad
consequences
.
sambo
2
years
ago
even
looking
at
it
that
way
i
still
fail
to
see
how
mal
ultimately
knew
tykjen
2
years
ago
she
had
a
radical
notion
.
nuff
said
sambo
2
years
ago
she
had
a
radical
notion
that
her
world
wasnt
real
not
that
cobb
had
incepted
her
.
she
never
knew
.
jeff
2
years
ago
here
is
another
point
about
the
dream
.
when
they
all
went
under
on
the
plane
it
was
raining
because
the
one
guy
had
to
take
a
leak
right
well
when
they
got
the
kick
and
to
wake
up
when
the
van
was
falling
off
the
bridgeit
was
still
raining
.
so
does
that
mean
that
they
were
still
at
that
one
level
down
in
the
dream
after
all
and
not
in
the
real
world
martin
phipps
2
years
ago
of
course
.
the
kick
brought
them
back
to
the
first
level
.
they
woke
up
when
the
sedative
wore
off
.
likewise
cobb
and
saito
were
never
in
danger
of
going
into
a
coma
and
not
waking
up
the
danger
was
that
they
would
not
remember
who
they
were
when
they
woke
up
.
we
see
saito
going
for
a
gun
presumably
to
shoot
himself
so
he
would
wake
up
but
it
could
be
they
woke
up
because
the
sedative
had
worn
off
.
which
is
a
good
point
.
theres
no
doubt
that
cobb
woke
up
on
the
plane
.
the
real
question
is
whether
or
not
the
entire
movie
was
a
dream
.
sambo
2
years
ago
i
think
it
is
also
important
to
make
the
distinction
between
the
entire
movie
was
a
dream
versus
the
entire
movie
takes
place
within
dreamshare
and
limbo
.
sambo
2
years
ago
the
first
version
implys
that
the
pasiv
device
is
the
figment
of
a
fevered
dream
.
the
second
that
the
pasiv
device
is
very
real
and
cobb
has
become
utterly
lost
within
it
.
adam
2
years

alright.so
i
know
the
debate
of
the
film
is
over.i
just
got
done
watching
it
and
was
wondering
if
anyone
else
had
this
thought.is
it
possible
that
the
college
girl
architect
was
investigating
cobb
and
that
the
reason
cobb
was
sent
free
was
because
it
was
determined
by
his
encounter
with
his
wife
at
the
end
of
the
film
that
he
truly
did
not
kill
his
wife
i
know
there
arent
any
direct
statements
within
the
film
to
prove
this
theory
to
be
correct
but
its
an
interesting
thought
that
during
this
inception
cobb
may
have
been
under
investigation
for
the
murder
of
his
wife
sambo
2
years
ago
fresh
take
adam
nice
angle
i
like
it
.
the
more
theories
the
better
in
my
opinion
as
long
as
they
only
contradict
audience
assumptions
and
not
the
facts
as
they
are
stated
.
ahmauri613
2
years
ago
i
watched
it
when
it
first
came
out
and
was
satisfied
but
then
i
kept
thinking
why
are
the
kids
still
wearing
the
same
thing
and
in
the
same
spot
why
are
they
the
same
age
as
when
he
left
why
dont
we
see
the
top
stop
spinning
so
i
ask
is
he
the
one
that
is
still
dreaming
and
his
wife
right
and
she
out
but
hes
still
in
help
me
jo
2
years
ago
nice
explanation
.
but
the
key
is
in
yusuf
basement
when
cobb
goes
into
sleep
and
dream
about
mal
he
falls
into
limbo
there
and
the
rest
of
all
movie
is
a
cobb
dream
.
you
can
notice
that
when
he
suposly
wakes
up
from
that
dream
the
top
falls
to
the
ground
and
never
was
tested
.
the
only
thing
that
changes
is
the
way
cobb
thinks
about
its
relation
with
mal
.

you
see
it
.
plenty
of
others
have
found
just
as
much
evidence
to
indicate
cobb
does
awaken
to
actual
reality
by
the
end
of
the
film

there
is
a
difference
.
unconscious
is
a
state
whereas
subconscious
is
an
element
of
the
mind
.

just
because
cobb
gets
distracted
by
his
kids
at
the
end
of
the
movie
preventing
him
and
the
audience
from
knowing
whether
hes
still
dreaming
or
not
doesnt
mean
he
will
never
know
for
sure
if
hes
still
dreaming
.
he
can
just
go
back
to
the
top
anytime
after
and
see
if
its
still
spinning
or
if
it
stopped
.
sure
we
as
the
audience
will
never
know
the
truth
but
let
cobb
enjoy
his
kids
whether
hes
dreaming
or
not
all
he
wants
is
to
experience
happiness
.

exactly
.
he
needs
to
get
back
home
in
the
real
world
cause
thats
the
only
place
he
can
see
his
childrens
faces
.
assurance
of
reality
prince
inferno
2
years
ago
there
was
one
small
scene
that
i
noticed
.
when
cobb
is
finding
his
team
he
meets
up
with
the
gentleman
forgive
me
for
not
knowing
the
characters
names
that
has
a
room
full
of
men
that
share
dreams
together
.
the
man
states
that
the
dreams
are
extremely
stable
.
cobb
has
a
dream
about
mal
his
dead
crazy
wife
and
then
wakes
himself
up
.
when
he
goes
into
the
bathroom
to
check
and
see
if
he
is
still
dreaming
sato
the
guy
making
the
deal
with
him
interrupts
him
and
ask
him
if
everything
is
all
right
.
cobb
picks
up
the
totem
and
walks
away
saying
yes
.
could
it
be
possible
that
he
was
sleeping
for
8
hours
like
the
rest
if
the
men
in
the
room
and
dreamt
that
he
completes
the
job
and
went
home
to
his
kids
.
in
addition
after
that
moment
in
the
bathroom
cobb
never
pulls
out
the
totem
until
the
end
.
food
for
thought
.
tykjen
2
years
ago
nah
.
cobb
followed
up
after
that
with
the
experiments
.
and
besides
saito
had
seen
the
totem
many
many
years
ago
and
he
did
in
that
bathroom
.
voidokm
2
years
ago
that
doesnt
really
matter
i
think
.
people
seem
to
forget
that
the
special
object
only
works
if
you
are
in
somebody
elses
dream
.
because
of
the
whole
not
being
allowed
to
know
the
weight
of
the
object
.
because
if
the
dreamer
knows
the
object
then
the
dreamer
can
manipulate
the
object
and
make
it
do
the
correct
actions
.
so
if
cobb
was
in
his
own
dream
down
in
yusufs
room
then
whether
or
not
saito
knocked
it
down
doesnt
matter
because
cobb
can
dream
the
object
to
do
whatever
he
wants
.
so
with
that
piece
of
information
i
dont
think
that
he
is
still
dreaming
when
he
spins
because
that
would
be
a
major
plothole
considering
it
doesnt
even
matter
in
his
own
dream
.
martin
2
years
ago
the
top
was
originally
mals
totem
and
he
said
that
mal
could
make
the
top
spin
and
spin
forever
and
presumably
he
could
too
and
that
was
how
he
convinced
her
that
she
was
dreaming
.
now
if
they
move
one
level
up
mal
should
realize
that
they
are
still
dreaming
and
try
the
top
and
presumably
she
did
and
it
spun
and
spun
and
she
was
convinced
that
she
was
still
dreaming
but
she
couldnt
convince
cobb
he
was
so
convinced
that
he
was
in
the
real
world
that
when
he
saw
the
top
it
would
stop
spinning
but
in
the
end
he
isnt
looking
at
the
top
so
it
keeps
spinning
.
so
that
suggests
that
he
had
been
dreaming
the
whole
movie
.
i
think
terryfinns
argument
for
him
being
in
a
dream
world
is
the
simplest
yet
although
it
could
also
be
argued
that
it
was
just
something
that
nolan
either
overlooked
or
didnt
show
perhaps
they
did
kill
themselves
a
few
more
times
to
get
back
to
reality
but
she
was
still
unconvinced
that
her
world
was
real
.
the
spinning
top
at
the
end
however
suggests
that
they
didnt
and
that
they
were
still
dreaming
.
vantasia
2
years
ago
i
loved
this
movie
.
its
probably
the
best
movie
ive
ever
seen
they
had
a
very
unusual
story
line
and
i
liked
it
.
i
was
also
pulled
in
to
how
they
ended
up
being
put
in
a
dream
then
another
dream
and
so
forth
.
i
was
intrigued
by
the
paradoxes
and
impossible
shapes
and
physics
.
i
thought
it
was
fascinating
how
the
time
was
distorted
according
to
dissimilar
levels
.
they
had
10
hours
in
reality
days
in
the
1st
level
weeks
in
the
2nd
level
a
decade
in
the
3rd
level
and
decades
in
limbo
.
overall
i
thought
this
movie
was
outstanding
.
just
a
guy
2
years
ago
doesnt
really
matter
whether
or
not
cobb
is
still
in
limbo
or
returned
to
the
real
world
.
all
that
really
matters
is
that
he
is
with
his
children
real
or
not
and
is
ultimately
a
happier
person
than
what
he
was
in
the
beginning
of
the
movie
.
even
if
it
is
just
false
happiness
created
by
his
own
subconsciousness
my
view
the
ending
was
left
to
keep
you
guessing
so
i
dont
think
there
needs
to
be
a
concrete
answer
.
doesnt
matter
how
much
you
want
one
you
wont
get
it
.
the
ending
is
a
big
tease
and
i
like
it
that
way
why
am
i
commenting
i
just
watched
the
movie
again
and
i
felt
like
it
.
random
note
laughed
really
hard
that
scarecrow
was
the
man
who
got
``
incepted
''
.
-yeah
dude
you
use
toxins
to
make
people
hallucinate
huh
well
i
just
went
into
your
mind
and
put
your
subconscious
into
a
dream
into
a
dream
and
then
into
another
dream
to
just
mess
with
you
man
...
yeah
who
's
the
ba
now-
love
it
you
actually
read
this
comment
good
going
but
i
just
wasted
like
a
minute
of
your
life
sorry
.
but
here
is
some
good
news
i
wasted
five
minutes
of
my
life
to
waste
a
minute
of
your
life
so
i
basically
screwed
myself
over
oh
well
robyn
2
years
ago
just
been
reading
all
the
comments
and
really
like
all
the
theories
.
im
not
sure
what
i
think
but
is
this
a
valid
idea
what
if
we
are
always
in
cobbs
dream
and
mal
keeps
trying
to
enter
it
to
wake
him
and
in
limbo
near
the
end
mal
realises
that
she
is
loosing
the
battle
to
convince
cobb
that
he
is
dreaming
and
decideds
never
to
come
back
does
that
mean
is
is
always
in
a
limbo
but
if
he
is
why
isnt
cobb
or
the
chrildren
getting
older
or
is
he
projecting
himself
in
that
imagd
is
any
of
that
even
possible
or
have
i
missed
the
idea
im
getting
mind
boggled
from
this
film
and
now
questioning
everything
about
it
like
mal
but
this
is
definatly
reality
we
are
in
raffi1990
2
years
ago
well
cobb
actually
reveals
to
ariadne
how
his
totems
works
so
the
ending
might
aswell
be
ariadnes
work
the
fact
that
cobb
and
saito
dont
wake
up
in
the
van
like
everyone
else
but
they
wake
up
straight
into
the
plane
could
be
a
hint
that
cobb
actually
never
reached
saito
but
from
the
moment
he
was
on
the
beach
into
saitos
limbo
he
was
actually
in
ariadnes
dreamarchitecture
.
so
that
would
mean
that
with
ariadne
knowing
how
cobbs
totem
works
she
might
aswell
fool
him
into
thinking
its
the
real
world
even
if
in
reality
cobb
is
dreaming
.
terryfinn
2
years

everyone
overlooks
a
few
simple
details
the
more
levels
deep
you
are
the
more
times
you
will
have
to
kill
yourself
.
killing
yourself
within
a
dream
within
a
dream
will
bring
you
back
to
the
original
dream
.
mal
and
cobb
was
in
limbo
which
we
think
is
atleast
four
levels
deep
.
they
were
waiting
for
a
train
and
when
the
train
hit
them
they
wake
up
.
wait
dont
they
have
to
kill
themselves
three
more
times
after
waking
up
from
limbo
martin
2
years
ago
sounds
legit
.
arthur
only
moved
up
one
level
when
he
died
in
the
opening
sequence
.
tykjen
2
years
ago
arthur
was
not
under
a
powerful
sedative
during
the
first
mission
on
saito
thats
why
he
woke
up
one
level
above
.
if
you
ask
me
perhaps
the
levels
above
cobb
and
mal
in
limbo
had
collapsed
because
they
died
in
the
dreamlevels
while
influenced
by
a
powerful
sedative
and
thats
how
they
ended
up
in
limbo
in
the
first
place
.
when
cobb
and
saito
escapes
limbo
in
the
end
the
levels
above
them
are
gone
.
martin
2
years
ago
it
wasnt
made
clear
due
to
the
frantic
pace
of
the
action
and
hence
little
time
for
exposition
but
i
take
it
that
cobb
and
saito
woke
up
when
the
sedative
wore
off
.
cobb
had
to
find
saito
and
remind
him
that
his
world
was
not
real
so
that
he
would
remember
who
he
was
when
he
woke
up
and
be
able
to
make
the
phone
call
that
would
enable
cobb
to
see
his
family
.
that
brings
up
another
point
though
.
if
cobb
and
mal
were
in
limbo
for
50
years
then
didnt
their
sedative
wear
off
and
if
it
didnt
wear
off
because
they
had
taken
too
much
then
would
killing
themselves
in
the
dream
work
some
people
say
that
cobb
and
saito
shot
themselves
and
woke
up
but
that
should
only
work
if
the
sedative
had
worn
off
.
so
if
the
sedative
has
worn
off
then
killing
yourself
in
the
dream
wakes
up
but
if
the
sedative
has
not
worn
off
then
killing
yourself
in
the
dream
wont
work
.
so
what
does
that
mean
with
arthur
in
the
opening
scene
he
dies
in
the
dream
but
he
only
goes
up
one
level
.
oh
i
see
it
is
because
the
architect
was
still
dreaming
and
arthur
was
in
his
dream
and
arthur
could
not
wake
up
until
his
dream
was
over
not
unless
he
died
again
with
the
sedative
having
worn
off
.
saito
and
cobb
could
wake
up
because
the
ames
arthur
and
the
chemist
had
already
woken
up
as
you
say
the
dreams
had
collapsed
because
the
dreamers
had
woken
up
.
but
then
that
brings
up
another
question
who
went
to
sleep
with
mal
and
cobb
that
they
were
able
to
get
to
limbo
and
stay
there
for
50
years
that
was
never
explained
.
for
the
job
they
needed
at
least
three
people
one
person
dreaming
each
level
.
i
dont
see
how
cobb
and
mal
reached
limbo
by
working
alone
.
that
was
never
explained
.
could
they
take
turns
with
cobb
dreaming
the
first
level
and
mal
dreaming
the
second
level
etc
.
but
then
the
levels
above
them
havent
collapsed
because
they
are
the
ones
dreaming
those
levels
.
oops
.
tykjen
2
years
ago
they
were
on
a
powerful
sedative
went
into
the
first
level
and
died
.
then
woke
up
to
a
new
reality
called
limbo
.
arthur
however
was
not
on
a
powerful
sedative
so
he
woke
up
the
level
above
as
usual
.
archaeon
2
years
ago
tykjen
that
is
how
i
understood
it
.
also
didnt
they
actually
explain
this
in
the
film
ive
never
felt
any
confusion
about
this
particular
issue
tykjen
2
years
ago
indeed
.
no
confusion
what
so
ever
but
many
people
in
these
comments
are
indeed
confused
martin
2
years
ago
but
you
are
forgetting
that
it
isnt
normal
for
people
to
take
drugs
go
to
sleep
and
then
wake
up
not
knowing
what
is
real
.
oh
wait
i
take
it
back
.
that
is
exactly
what
happens
when
you
take
drugs
assuming
you
wake
up
at
all
.
never
mind
.
sambo
2
years
ago
the
particulars
of
mal
and
cobbs
getting
to
limbo
were
intentionally
glossed
over
.
the
best
we
got
was
that
they
went
too
deep
.
sambo
2
years
ago
we
can
only
assume
they
died
to
get
to
limbo
just
as
we
can
only
assume
that
there
are
only
4
levels
of
dreamshare
.
the
lack
of
specifics
serves
the
ambiguity
hence
the
lack
of
specifics
.
joop
2
years
ago
as
i
understand
it
the
limbo
is
not
a
higher
level
of
dreamstate
rather
it
is
an
unconstructed
dreamstate
as
mentioned
in
the
film
.
therefore
you
can
fall
into
a
limbo
without
having
constructed
multiple
dream
layers
.
you
can
just
construct
a
single
dream
layer
then
kill
yourself
to
fall
into
an
unconstructed
limboon
the
supposition
that
you
are
under
a
strong
enough
sedation
.
and
thats
how
cobb
and
mal
were
able
to
fall
into
a
limbo
without
extra
personel
.
they
took
a
strong
sedative
that
would
stop
them
from
waking
up
before
it
would
ware
off
and
killed
themselves
at
the
first
level
of
dreamstate
thus
falling
into
an
unconstructed
limbo
where
mal
refused
to
wake
upkill
her
self
even
after
the
sedation
would
have
worn
off
because
she
accepted
the
limbo
as
reality
losing
her
mind
like
when
adrine
tells
cobb
after
he
decides
to
stay
in
the
limbo
to
find
saito
dont
lose
your
mind
.
cobb
then
had
to
convince
her
that
they
were
in
a
limbo
and
they
killed
themselves
waking
up
after
spending
a
lifetime
in
the
limbo
.
archaeon
2
years
ago
yes
.
tykjen
2
years
ago
but
cobb
did
speak
from
experience
.
i
dont
think
they
went
in
only
one
level
before
they
ended
up
in
limbo
.
i
believe
cobb
and
mal
experimented
with
great
depth
but
ultimately
lots
of
stuff
went
wrong..and
years
went
by
playing
god
in
limbo
after
one
of
them
died
and
one
perhaps
followed
.
the
scene
at
the
anniversary..could
that
be
when
there
is
so
much
that
is
unsaid
in
inception
which
we
can
only
imagine
.
why
did
mal
want
to
stay
in
limbo
and
not
wake
up
at
one
time
they
both
understood
limbo
but
mal
chose
to
stay
there
.
she
fooled
herself
with
her
own
totem
placing
it
toppled
in
reality
mode
in
her
own
safe
.
she
did
this
on
purpose
to
herself..
yet
another
experiment
that
went
wrong
.
joop
2
years
ago
yes
you
are
right
cobb
did
say
that
he
and
mal
experimented
with
dream
stages
.
and
imo
based
strictly
on
my
assumption
during
those
experimentspossibly
with
other
people
and
sometimes
cobb
staying
on
one
level
and
mal
going
into
another
they
may
have
stumbled
upon
the
existence
of
the
limbo
.
then
they
both
decided
to
go
into
limbo
together
via
the
method
i
have
suggested
above
without
the
help
of
others
.
and
they
did
spend
years
playing
god
in
the
limbo
during
which
mal
lost
her
mind
the
attraction
of
the
limbo
was
too
great
similar
to
why
ariadne
came
back
to
cobbs
workshopand
decided
to
lockaway
her
symbol
of
reality
into
her
subconscious
safe
losing
her
sense
of
whats
real
and
what
isnt
completely
.
cobb
who
was
still
aware
used
inception
breaking
into
her
subconscious
safe
and
spinning
her
totem
to
plant
the
idea
in
mals
mind
that
the
limbo
is
a
dream
.
and
they
both
killed
themselves
together
by
going
under
the
train
.
after
they
came
back
to
reality
the
idea
that
cobb
had
put
into
mals
subconscious
kept
own
growing
like
a
virus
and
eventually
mal
started
to
doubt
the
world
in
which
they
were
in
and
was
convinced
that
she
was
still
dreaming
and
tried
to
persuade
cobb
as
well
.
cobb
refused
and
so
mal
devised
a
plan
to
commit
suicide
on
their
wedding
aniversary
telling
the
authorities
false
lies
about
cobb
putting
him
in
danger
so
that
he
will
commit
suicide
with
her
.
mal
died
and
cobb
became
a
fugitive
.

well
put
.
and
yea
nolan
is
a
true
genius
alright
.
truly
open
film
.
i
sometimes
watch
the
anniversary
scene
as
something
that
may
have
happened
in
one
of
the
dreamlevels
they
experimented
with
.
mal
tried
to
convince
cobb
they
were
still
stuck
after
escaping
limbo
.
and
she
took
her
leap
of
faith
and
woke
up
but
cobb
was
the
one
that
stayed
behind
and
forever
after
lost
in
a
loop
and
projects
everyone
and
everything
around
him
figments
of
his
own
personality
to
guide
him
out
.
ariadne
was
clearly
a
female
version
of
cobb
in
a
way
.
she
kept
pushing
and
pushing
wanted
cobb
to
go
deeper
further
.

okay
i
see
where
you
are
going
with
this
.
so
they
kill
themselves
in
their
dream
to
wake
up
but
because
they
have
taken
a
strong
sedative
they
dont
wake
up
but
go
into
limbo
.
they
need
to
spend
years
in
limbo
because
it
was
a
strong
sedative
and
they
will
need
to
have
a
few
hours
pass
in
the
real
world
if
the
sedative
is
to
wear
off
.
they
kill
themselves
again
and
cobb
believes
he
is
back
in
the
real
world
but
mal
is
not
sure
she
kills
herself
but
she
is
unable
to
convince
cobb
to
kill
himself
.
so
is
cobb
still
dreaming
or
not
i
think
they
were
still
dreaming
because
i
dont
think
the
dream
above
them
had
collapsed
.
that
makes
a
big
difference
arthur
died
in
a
dream
but
he
didnt
wake
up
he
just
went
up
one
level
.
cobb
and
saito
may
have
woken
up
from
limbo
but
cobb
that
is
irrelevant
because
cobb
is
still
dreaming
.
we
didnt
actually
see
cobb
and
saito
shoot
each
other
the
fact
that
they
realized
they
were
in
a
dream
with
the
sedative
having
worn
off
may
have
been
enough
to
cause
them
to
wake
up
.
tykjen
2
years
ago
during
the
saito
mission
arthur
was
killed
in
level
2
and
woke
up
in
level
1
.
same
with
saito
who
thought
he
was
waking
up
in
his
own
apartment
in
reality
.
cobb
was
woken
up
with
a
kick
since
the
slap
he
got
from
nash
didnt
do
anything.see
very
stable
.
normal
procedure
for
dreamshare
to
wake
up
when
you
die
.
but
the
thing
with
the
mission
was
something
new
something
even
the
great
saito
didnt
know
they
were
2
levels
down
and
the
same
rules
still
applied
.
if
arthur
had
been
killed
in
level
1
hed
woken
up
on
the
train
in
reality
.
joop
2
years

as
we
all
seem
to
be
assuming
out
of
context
here
very
interestingly
so
i
think
if
mal
did
wake
up
instead
of
falling
to
her
death
shed
surely
have
tried
to
wake
up
cobb
by
giving
him
the
kick
which
is
quicker
and
more
effective
than
coming
back
to
his
subconscious
and
persuading
him
to
kill
hisself
.
and
so
the
fact
that
we
dont
see
cobb
being
given
the
kick
apart
from
the
ones
involved
in
the
job
i
would
say
that
argument
is
a
lil
farfetched..nonetheless
very
imaginative
and
engaging
.
sambo
2
years

thats
why
i
value
the
ambiguity
surrounding
the
possibilty
that
the
pair
of
them
reached
limbo
not
through
a
first-level-death
but
through
a
much
deeper-level-death
.
which
of
course
is
to
indulge
the
assumption
that
more
than
4
dream
levels
are
a
possibility
.
but
if
anyone
can
give
me
something
solid
to
disprove
the
idea
id
be
happy
to
close
the
book
on
it
.
sambo
2
years
ago
the
significance
of
which
i
should
add
is
the
extended
time
ratio
which
multiple
levels
would
provide
.
the
time
it
takes
for
mal
to
stand
up
and
give
him
the
kick
could
be
a
year
for
cobb
.
also
the
limbo
to
reality
time
ratio
is
never
given
to
us
explicitly
.
and
for
that
matter
if
you
go
to
limbo
from
level
1
is
your
time
ratio
to
reality
the
same
as
if
you
go
to
limbo
from
level
4
or
hows
that
work
.
does
limbo
have
a
time
ratio
constant
sqlguy
2
years
ago
the
movie
seemed
to
establish
though
that
a
different
dreamer
in
the
same
dreamshare
was
needed
for
each
level
.
with
only
cobb
and
mal
they
shouldnt
have
been
able
to
go
more
than
two
levels
down
and
then
one
of
them
would
already
have
been
left
out
.
for
the
type
of
timescale
difference
youre
suggesting
between
cobb
and
a
woken
up
mal
they
would
have
had
to
have
been
many
more
levels
down
and
they
would
have
needed
a
few
more
dreamers
.
sambo
2
years

not
necessarily
the
movie
only
establishes
the
guidelines
like
that
because
it
is
essential
for
the
team
to
have
a
strategy
for
kicking
themselves
back
to
reality
hence
the
different
dreamers
in
each
level
.
i
posit
that
taking
turns
between
2
people
could
have
worked
.
after
all
the
pasiv
device
is
new
technology
and
even
cobb
still
experiments
with
it
and
he
is
considered
an
expert
to
some
degree
so
surely
we
cant
be
sure
of
anything
that
isnt
otherwise
stated
in
the
film
.
tykjen
2
years
ago
agreed
.
whos
to
say
they
couldnt
take
turns
after
all
they
were
experimenting
going
deeper
and
deeper
further
.
downwards
is
the
only
way
forwards..
sambo
2
years

btw
on
a
strong
sedative
120
one
need
only
be
4
levels
deep
to
turn
2
seconds
into
370
days
.
i
can
show
you
the
math
if
you
like
.
tykjen
2
years
ago
but
the
problem
is
if
you
wakekick
up
someone
from
limbo
they
will
be
in
a
state
of
coma
.
it
was
important
for
teh
subject
to
truly
know
that
limbo
wasnt
real
before
leaving
.
but
mal
was
not
sure
when
she
left
with
cobb
.
mal
loved
cobb
too
much
and
wanted
to
leave
with
him
on
the
traintracks
without
question
.
but
when
mal
was
leaving
cobb
he
could
not
.
he
was
always
so
sure
what
was
real
or
not..
but
mal
was
the
complex
one
who
really
knew
the
absolute
they
could
be
100
certain
that
they
could
never
be
sure
.
and
the
inception
sadly
caused
mal
to
be
fixxed
on
the
idea
given
by
cobb
you
world
is
not
real
.
she
got
that
idea
in
limbo
after
50
years..must
have
been
tough
to
leave
.
sambo
2
years
ago
i
forgot
that
thanks
ty
.
also
1
.
do
you
think
it
is
possible
for
a
kick
to
reach
from
reality
to
limbo
if
the
intervening
dream
levels
have
already
been
deconstructed
.
and
2
.
if
they
went
from
the
first
level
to
limbo
what
do
you
imagine
their
time
ratio
would
be
as
i
was
getting
at
tykjen
2
years
ago
great
depth
was
a
hot
topic
of
discussion
within
inception
so
i
firmly
believe
cobb
and
mal
experimented
with
3
levels
.
this
is
very
important
to
not
overlook
because
cobb
speaks
of
experience
.
yusuf
says
at
first
its
impossible
when
talking
about
3
levels
.
cobb
says
one
only
has
to
add
a
sedative
.
yusuf
corrects
cobb
by
adding
powerful
sedative
to
which
cobb
nods
without
saying
a
word
.
as
for
your
questions
i
dont
think
a
kick
in
reality
would
wake
up
anyone
from
limbo
.
anyone
who
is
in
limbo
needs
to
be
delivered
a
message
that
its
not
real
before
they
can
leave
is
my
inkling
anyway
.
eames
is
the
one
who
only
brushes
upon
that
if
one
ends
in
limbo
and
wakes
up
from
it
theres
a
great
chance
youd
have
brains
for
scrambled
eggs
.
as
for
your
second
point
i
see
limbo
as
its
own
level
with
its
own
time
compression
.
one
could
die
in
level
3
and
go
there
or
in
level
1
and
go
there
and
the
time
compression
does
not
matter
down
there
.
1
second
in
reality
can
be
a
year
for
that
matter
in
limbo
.
limbo
is
for
me
also
a
state
of
mind
outside
reality
.
where
there
are
no
rules
no
time
.
sambo
2
years
ago
yeah
i
think
i
tend
to
agree
limbo
would
have
its
own
independent
time
ratio
and
as
it
is
pretty
much
the
act
of
one
directly
interfacing
with
their
subconscious
one
would
expect
that
it
would
be
at
maximum
ratio
whatever
that
might
be
.
joop
2
years

please
do
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
but
didnt
ariadne
wake
up
from
a
limbounconstructured
dream
she
went
into
with
cobb
to
find
fischer
by
throwing
herself
off
cobbmals
apartment
and
she
and
others
rode
the
synchronised
kick
to
the
first
level
to
wait
for
the
sedative
to
wear
off
the
reason
why
cobb
who
also
eventuallydied
from
the
mal-inflicted
stab
wound
in
the
limbo
didnt
wake
up
is
because
the
dream
right
up
above
had
collapsed
dream
3eames
and
2arthur-and
drowned
in
the
first
dreamyusef
hence
he
got
lost
into
a
further
limbo
waking
up
on
saitos
armed
shore
.
the
only
way
cobb
and
saito
could
get
out
of
the
limbo
now
was
to
wait
for
the
sedatives
to
wear
off
and
hope
that
the
team
would
give
them
the
kick
as
soon
as
they
awoke
.
therefore
the
limbo
is
not
a
coma
its
merely
an
unconstructed
dream
from
which
you
can
easily
awake
with
a
kick
however
the
problem
in
this
case
was
that
everyone
who
could
give
cobbsaito
the
kick
was
also
still
in
the
dream
and
they
were
all
under
a
strong
sedative
set
on
a
timer
which
is
a
loooong
time
for
saito
.
and
this
is
the
reason
why
cobb
chose
to
stay
in
the
limbo
to
find
saito
not
because
saito
would
fall
into
a
coma
and
never
wake
up
but
because
saito
could
forget
who
he
was
and
could
become
mentally
ill
when
he
wakes
up
like
mal
.
thats
why
we
see
cobb
and
saito
exchange
a
dialogue
in
saitos
castle
reminding
themselves
of
who
they
wereeven
cobb
seems
confused
.
and
this
is
also
why
we
see
cobb
and
saito
wake
up
naturally
on
the
plane
rather
than
through
a
kick
because
the
team
couldnt
know
for
sure
if
cobb
had
managed
to
remind
saito
of
the
truth
so
they
put
away
all
the
equipment
so
that
fischer
wouldnt
get
suspicious
but
left
cobb
and
saito
to
sleep
.
this
does
not
mean
to
say
that
cobb
actually
woke
up
into
reality
.
going
to
find
saito
was
cobbs
plan
which
ariadne
knew
and
how
cobb
imagagined
he
would
wake
up.so
it
could
be
either
and
sambo
if
as
you
say
there
was
another
level
into
which
cobb
and
mal
awoke
from
their
limbo
train
track
death
and
that
cobb
is
still
on
this
dream
level
while
mal
could
be
a
level
higher
or
even
in
supposed
reality
then
the
time
difference
between
mal
and
cobb
may
not
be
years
but
minutes
or
hours
because
cobb
will
not
in
a
limbo
anymore
but
in
one
of
their
structured
dreams
1
or
2
levels
above
depending
on
how
many
they
created
.
so
if
mal
was
to
give
him
the
kick
in
whichever
stage
that
she
may
be
throughout
the
timespan
of
the
movie
at
least
a
few
weeks
we
should
have
seen
cobb
feel
the
kick
or
some
even
sort
of
a
sign
.
sambo
2
years

limbo
or
not
if
cobb
is
again
thats
if
he
is
by
some
chance
5
layers
deep
1
second
in
reality
would
be
just
over
ten
years
to
him
.
sambo
2
years
ago
so
he
should
be
expecting
mals
kick
anytime
in
the
next
20
to
30
years
or
so
lol
lets
hope
she
doesnt
decide
to
go
to
the
bathroom
first
ha
.
sambo
2
years

that
is
on
a
120
sedative
as
yusuf
suggests
i
should
add
.
without
sedative
the
ratio
is
112.
joop
2
years
ago
yes
you
are
right
haha
.
scary
.
but
if
as
u
say
they
were
5
dreams
deep
and
the
lvls
above
hadnt
collapsed
killing
yourself
at
level
5
as
mal
did
by
jumping
from
her
hotel
room
would
only
bring
you
to
the
next
level
up-4
.
so
wed
have
to
calculate
the
time
difference
between
lvl
5
and
lvl4
rather
than
lvl
5
and
reality
to
see
when
mals
kick
would
reach
cobb
joop

awful..

ms

sambo

ur
fine..
maybe
throw
some
line

it
easier

all
lol
.
joop
2

furthermore..
having
debates
over
the
validity
of
cobbs
totem
and
whether
it
was
about
to
topple
at
the
very
end
is
counterproductive
and
will
have
us
circling
in
a
paradoxical
loop
.
1
.
saitos
handling
of
cobbs
totem
does
not
ruin
its
purpose
they
were
already
in
a
constructed
dream
.
the
reason
why
arthur
teaches
ariadne
to
keep
her
totem
safe
from
others
reach
is
because
if
an
architect
in
the
real
world
gets
hold
of
her
totem
and
observes
its
purpose
then
the
architect
is
be
able
to
imitate
such
a
totem
and
construct
it
into
his
architecture
defeating
the
purpose
and
integrity
of
ariadnes
totem
.
therefore
the
integrity
of
cobbs
totem
is
protected
throughout
the
film
the
only
other
person
who
knew
about
the
totem
mal
is
dead
.
2
.
the
ending
doesnt
simply
pivot
around
the
simple
notion
that
if
the
totem
spins
on
its
a
dream
and
if
it
topples
its
reality
.
we
must
take
note
of
the
scene
where
cobb
tries
to
persuade
mal
of
the
fact
that
they
are
in
reality
by
confronting
her
with
his
inability
to
control
his
totem
.
mal
argues
back
saying
thats
because
you
dont
know
you
are
dreaming
.
this
is
a
very
very
important
factor
.
the
last
dreamstate
or
limbo
cobb
puts
himself
into
is
his
own
.
the
previous
dreams
of
eames
arthur
and
yusef
have
collapsed
due
to
the
synchronised
kicks
.
lets
suppose
cobb
was
still
in
the
limbo
when
he
came
home
to
his
kids
.
from
the
moment
cobbs
wakes
up
on
the
plane
he
looks
confused
and
he
checks
the
others
to
see
if
anything
is
strange
.
he
gets
home
and
still
very
unsure
spins
his
totem
but
before
he
could
see
if
it
toppled
he
runs
to
see
his
kids.now
up
until
this
very
moment
cobbs
had
restricted
himself
from
seeing
his
kids
faces
until
he
was
sure
that
they
were
real
.
but
now
hes
not
so
sure
.
he
doenst
know
for
a
fact
that
this
is
real
but
his
wanting
to
believethat
its
real
mal
what
do
you
believe
has
carried
him
from
the
aiport
to
his
home
and
to
his
kids
.
but
then
why
does
the
totem
seem
like
it
is
about
to
topple
at
the
very
last
cut
because
he
doesnt
know
for
sure
andor
doesnt
want
to
believe
that
this
is
a
dream
.
and
because
this
is
his
dream
he
has
control
over
his
totem
and
his
subconcious
his
longing
for
his
kids
may
well
have
toppled
his
totem
to
convince
himself
that
this
is
real
.
so
as
you
can
see
whether
the
totem
topples
is
not
so
much
the
issue
because
at
this
very
last
scene
and
at
this
last
scene
only
his
totem
has
lost
its
purpose
.
the
totem
could
topple
in
both
dream
and
reality
.
this
film
has
given
us
a
truly
open
ending
.
