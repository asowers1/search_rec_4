wise
to
not
rely
entirely
on
computer
images
rather
blending
the
new
technology
with
old-fashioned
practical

and
the
result
is
a

that
looks

than
any

''
jurassic
park
''
is
one
of
those
films
that
will
always
stand
the
test
of
time
.
this
timeless
film
follows
a
team
of
scientists
as
they
discover
through
dinosaur
fossils
that
their
dna
can
be
recreated
.
and
so
their
idea
to
open
a
park
on
an
island
to
bring
in
families
for
their
own
viewing
pleasure
begins
.
this
film
because
of
it
's
backstory
is
very
believable
and
it
is
what
most
of
today
's
big
budget
films
are
missing
a
believable
human
element
.
i
love
every
second
of
this
film
from
it
's
fantastic
characters
to
it
's
giant
plot
to
it
's
``
larger-than-life
''
characters
.
this
will
forever
be
one
of
my
favourite
films
.
``
jurassic
park
''
is
a
phenomenal
piece
of
filmmaking

steven

's
1993
``
dinosaurs
on
the
loose
''
action-fest
is
almost
comparable
to
star
wars
in
the
way
it
opened
audiences
'
mind
to
the
possibilities
of
visual
effects
particularly
the
previously
little-used
cgi
.
even
by
today
's
standards
the
cgi
and
animatronic
effects
still
hold
a
candle
to
modern
efforts
breathing
vivid
life
and
personality
into
the
prehistoric
beasts
.
due
to
seeing
this
movie
in
the
theaters
at
a
young
age
certain
scenes
such
as
the
first
t-rex
appearance
and
any
suspenseful
sequence
with
the
velociraptors
are
forever
burned
in
my
memory
.
but
how
does
the
actual
movie
hold
up
once
the
nostalgia
goggles
are
taken
off
well
the
film
's
biggest
asset
aside
from
the
entertaining
visuals
is
by
far
spielberg
's
self-assured
direction
and
it
's
tight
pacing
.
there
is
very
little
wasted
time
when
it
comes
to
establishing
the
plot
and
key
exposition
points
before
diving
into
the
awe-inspiring
action
sequences
.
also
the
touchingly
emotional
score
by
the
ever-reliable
john
williams
is
absolutely
breath
taking
and
is
as
iconic
as
the
film
itself
.
while
never
boring
this
sci-fi
adventure
is
little
different
from
the
``
big
dumb
hollywood
spectacles
''
that
infest
modern-day
summers
.
the
characters
are
rather
unremarkable
and
under-written
.
john
hammond
the
fun-loving
park
manager
that
is
played
delightfully
by
richard
attenborough
is
the
only
person
that
goes
through
anything
resembling
an
arc
but
even
then
it
's
nothing
spectacular
.
the
story
seems
mostly
concerned
with
getting
to
the
next
action
set
piece
as
soon
as
possible
with
little
breathing
room
for
the
characters
to
develop
.
due
to
this
actors
such
as
sam
neil
laura
dern
and
martin
ferrero
are
given
very
little
to
work
with
outside
of
clunky
and
cliché
exposition-laden
dialogue
the
``
show
do
n't
tell
rule
''
is
broken
quite
a
few
times
in
this
film
.
jeff
goldblum
fairs
a
little
better
as
ian
malcolm
despite
being
mostly
regulated
to
one-dimensional
comic
relief
and
meanwhile
wayne
knight
gives
way
to
some
pretty
funny
moments
.
the
script
tries
to
bring
up
ethical
questions
pertaining
to
``
science
vs.
nature
''
but
it
's
half-baked
and
practically
dropped
by
the
time
the
second-half
kicks
in
.
it
also
does
not
help
how
the
characters
act
very
stupid
at
times
malcolm
during
the
t-rex
's
debut
appearance
and
some
pretty
blatant
continuity
errors
the
t-rex
somehow
sneaking
up
on
velociraptors
despite
previously
making
tremors
wherever
it
went.in
the
end
this
influential
blockbuster
delivers
on
its
still-impressive
special
effects
and
infectious
thrills
but
stumbles
with
it
's
straightforward-to-a-fault
narrative
and
thin
characterization
.
while
i
'll
always
have
a
soft-spot
for
this
flick
it
's
just
a
shame
that
as
an
adult
what
i
remember
so
fondly
makes
up
only
a
fraction
of
it
's
actual
quality
.

if
you
do

then
run

see
this
now
because
you
will
be
missing

i
saw
a

in

when
i
saw
the

movie
and
immediately
knew
i
wanted
to
see
this
again
.
i
wanted
to
see
it
at

but
due
to
where
i
was
the
day
we
were
gon
na
go
i
could
only
see
it
in
3d
.
the
3d
is
done
well
but
it
does
n't
really
add
anything
to
enhance
the
movie
unless
you
see
it
in
imax
.
the
teaser
i
saw
was
the
t-rex
scene
and
let
me
tell
you
that
was
something
special
.
you
felt
like
you
were
right
there
in
the
car
with
the
kids
and
wanted
to
hold
your
ears
shut
too
at
how
loud
the
t-rex
roars
.
the
effects
on
this
movie
are
still
awe
inspiring
and
better
than
most
movies
made
today

has
been
very
kind
