see
all
my
reviews
well
i
just
saw
avatar
this
morning
one
of
the
press
premieres
which
are
running
on
these
days
.
my
opinion
you
've
seen
this
story
a
hundred
times
but
never
like
this
.
finally
3d
is
what
it
's
supposed
to
be
an
instrument
at
the
service
of
the
movie
.
you
'll
enjoy
the
visual
experience
no
doubt.as
for
the
story
some
of
the
``
inspirations
''
are
so
huge
and
so
obvious
that
mentioning
two
or
three
of
them
would
really
ruin
the
movie
for
you
and
i
'm
not
willing
to
do
that
.
lots
of
mysticism
and
ecology
if
you
like
that
stuff
.
if
you
're
15
or
so
you
'll
have
a
great
time
thinking
that
it
's
the
first
time
somebody
makes
something
like
this
.
if
you
're
an
experienced
movie
watcher
better
leave
your
