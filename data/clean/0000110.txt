the
eagle
has
landed
by
jack
higgins
book
review
yes
my
skills
in
photography
are
quite
awful
authors
note
at
precisely
one
o'clock
on
the
morning
of
saturday
6
november
1943
heinrich
himmler
reichsfuhrer
of
the
ss
and
chief
of
state
police
received
a
simple
message
.
the
eagle
has
landed
.
it
meant
that
a
small
force
of
german
paratroopers
were
at
that
moment
safely
in
england
and
poised
to
snatch
the
british
prime
minister
winston
churchill
from
the
norfolk
county
house
near
the
sea
where
he
was
spending
a
quiet
weekend
.
this
book
is
an
attempt
to
recreate
the
events
surrounding
that
astonishing
exploit
.
at
least
fifty
per
cent
of
it
is
documented
historical
fact
.
the
reader
must
decide
for
himself
how
much
of
the
rest
is
a
matter
of
speculation
or
fiction
...
now
the
field
of
battle
is
a
land
of
standing
corpses
those
determined
to
die
will
live
those
who
hope
to
escape
with
their
lives
will
die
.
wu
chi
the
eagle
has
landed
is
a
world
war
ii
novel
written
by
the
british
author
jack
higgins
.
it
is
the
first
book
featuring
liam
devlin
a
recurring
character
in
higgins
subsequent
novels
.
a
book
with
total
sales
of
over
50
million
is
more
than
sufficient
to
get
anyone
interested
and
my
historical
fiction
being
my
favourite
genre
i
became
desperate
to
get
my
hands
on
the
book
.
the
prologue
contains
a
false
document
with
jack
higgins
visiting
a
remote
village
in
norfolk
in
search
of
the
grave
of
a
certain
charles
gascoigne
but
ends
up
finding
something
far
more
interesting
than
what
he
had
come
for
.
the
story
is
loosely
based
on
the
tentative
nazi
plan
of
kidnapping
winston
churchill
as
stated
by
the
author
himself
.
the
story
begins
with
the
germans
celebrating
otto
skorenzys
success
in
bringing
mussolini
back
.
this
gets
hitler
rather
enthusiastic
and
starts
contemplating
over
a
possibility
of
replicating
otto
skorenzys
success
in
abducting
winston
churchill
.
hitler
delegates
the
task
to
admiral
canaris
the
head
of
abwehr
who
is
sceptical
about
the
whole
thing
orders
one
of
his
subordinates
max
radl
to
conduct
a
feasibility
study
to
create
a
record
that
they
did
take
some
effort
.
little
did
radl
realise
that
the
operation
is
more
than
possible
which
gets
the
reichsfuhrer
serious
about
the
whole
thing
and
decides
to
keep
canaris
in
the
dark
.
churchill
was
supposed
to
visit
a
remote
village
in
norfolk
where
the
germans
had
an
agent
who
had
kept
them
fully
informed
.
colonel
kurt
steiner
is
set
to
head
the
mission
who
himself
doesnt
have
a
very
good
past
.
he
is
a
really
loveable
character
a
person
with
a
strong
sense
of
right
and
wrong
and
in
fact
he
helped
a
jew
escape
which
made
him
get
into
the
bad
books
of
his
superiors
.
the
reason
why
steiner
was
chosen
was
for
his
background
half-american
who
grew
up
in
london
which
would
easily
enable
him
to
pass
through
the
streets
of
norfolk
as
a
native
.
to
assist
steiner
and
his
men
a
former
ira
man
is
summoned
by
the
germans
liam
devlin
a
dangerous
man
with
a
very
shady
past
and
the
sarcasm
he
maintains
throughout
the
book
is
quite
amazing
.
this
book
was
rather
different
for
me
personally
for
a
fact
that
ive
read
some
world
war
ii
novels
with
protagonists
from
the
allies
but
i
had
not
read
a
similar
book
with
a
german
protagonist
.
the
plot
was
amazing
with
an
interesting
idea
and
extremely
well
narrated
.
for
a
change
i
found
some
sort
of
significance
in
a
romantic
sub-plot
between
devlin
and
a
local
girl
in
the
norfolk
village
which
certainly
is
a
rarity
.
it
also
had
a
good
contrast
devlin
and
steiner
having
totally
different
personalities
the
former
a
totally
merciless
person
with
no
ethics
whatsoever
and
the
latter
a
very
honourable
person
and
highly
considerate
towards
his
enemies
.
so
far
especially
the
alistair
maclean
novels
the
soldiers
of
the
axis
powers
were
shown
only
as
merciless
killing
machines
but
higgins
portrayed
the
german
soldiers
in
a
completely
different
manner
portraying
them
as
normal
humans
seems
to
be
a
privilege
thanks
to
the
hate
campaign
from
the
winners
of
the
war
.
i
also
developed
a
sympathy
for
steiner
higgins
success
for
sure
that
is
despite
the
highly
despicable
operation
that
he
was
carrying
out
owing
to
the
way
in
which
he
carried
out
his
mission
i
felt
that
he
didnt
deserve
to
die
either
in
action
or
at
the
hands
of
his
own
men
for
failing
his
mission
and
im
sure
that
im
not
the
only
person
who
has
stumbled
upon
this
thought
.
but
on
the
flipside
i
found
one
and
that
was
highly
significant
that
is
the
false
document
with
which
it
began
.
higgins
found
a
grave
yes
but
not
of
charles
gascoigne
but
of
kurt
steiner
and
his
thirteen
men
killed
in
action
.
this
meant
that
whatever
happens
the
reader
knows
that
theyre
all
eventually
going
to
die
thereby
removing
the
essential
element
of
a
thriller
which
is
suspense
in
the
first
few
pages
.
i
had
been
searching
for
this
book
for
a
really
long
time
.
two
years
at
least
i
found
every
other
book
of
higgins
except
this
one
and
i
even
failed
in
an
online
order
with
the
money
eventually
getting
refunded
.
finally
i
found
a
very
old
edition
in
a
library
after
a
really
long
wait
and
ive
got
to
say
this
it
was
certainly
worth
the
wait
the
only
painful
part
of
this
whole
experience
was
that
i
had
to
return
the
book
.
id
conclude
my
review
i
was
in
half
a
mind
to
award
this
a
nine
but
a
thriller
without
an
element
of
suspense
is
not
something
that
could
be
ignored
.
that
pulls
my
rating
down
to
eight
.
