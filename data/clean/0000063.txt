he
states
that
although
he
has
had
opportunities

the
minute

seems
about
the
same
age
as
holden
and
he
begins
to
view
her
as
a
person
.

uncomfortable

holden
shops
for
a
special

''
for
his
10-year-old

he
spots
a
small
boy
singing
``
if

alfred
lunt
and
lynn
fontanne

afterward
holden
and
sally

while
drinking
coke
holden
impulsively
invites
sally
to
run
away
with
him
to
the
wilderness
.
she
declines
and
her
response
deflates
holden
's
mood
prompting
him
to
remark
``
you
give
me
a
royal
pain
in
the
ass
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
.
''
he
regrets

throughout
the
novel
holden
has
been
worried
about
the
ducks
in
the
lagoon
at
central
park
.
he
tries
to
find
them
but
only
manages
to
break
phoebe
's
record
in
the
process
.
exhausted
physically
mentally
and
financially
holden
heads
home
to
see
his
sister
.
holden
recalls
the
museum
of
natural
history
which
he
often
visited
as
a
child
.
he
contrasts
his
evolving
life
with
the
statues
of
eskimos
in
a
diorama
whereas
the
statues
have
remained
unchanged
through
the
years
he
and
the
world
have
not
.
these
reflections
may
be
prompted
by
the
death
of
his
brother
allie
.
eventually
he
sneaks
into
his
parents
'
apartment
while
they
are
out
to
visit
his
younger
sisterâand
close
friendâphoebe
the
only
person
with
whom
he
seems
to
be
able
to
communicate
.
holden
shares
a
fantasy
he
has
been
thinking
about
based
on
a
mishearing
of
robert
burns
'
comin
'
through
the
rye
he
pictures
himself
as
the
sole
guardian
of
thousands
of
children
playing
an
unspecified
'game
'
in
a
huge
rye
field
on
the
edge
of
a
cliff
.
his
job
is
to
catch
the
children
if
in
their
abandon
they
come
close
to
falling
off
the
brink
to
be
in
effect
the
``
catcher
in
the
rye
''
.
because
of
this
misinterpretation
holden
believes
that
to
be
the
``
catcher
in
the
rye
''
means
to
save
children
from
losing
their
innocence
.
when
his
parents
come
home
holden
slips
out
and
visits
his
former
and
much-admired
english
teacher
mr.
antolini
who
offers
advice
on
life
along
with
a
place
to
sleep
for
the
night
.
mr.
antolini
quoting
a
psychologist
named
wilhelm
stegel
advises
holden
that
wishing
to
die
for
a
noble
cause
is
the
mark
of
the
immature
man
while
it
is
the
mark
of
the
mature
man
to
aspire
to
live
humbly
for
one
.
this
is
at
odds
with
holden
's
ideas
of
becoming
a
``
catcher
in
the
rye
''
symbolically
saving
children
from
the
evils
of
adulthood
.
during
the
speech
on
life
mr.
antolini
has
a
number
of
cocktails
served
in
highball
glasses
.
holden
is
upset
when
he
wakes
up
in
the
night
to
find
mr.
antolini
patting
his
head
in
a
way
that
he
regards
as
``
flitty
''
homosexual
.
confused
and
uncertain
he
leaves
and
spends
his
last
afternoon
wandering
the
city
.
he
questions
whether
his
interpretation
of
mr.
antolini
's
actions
was
actually
correct
and
seems
to
wonder
how
much
it
matters
anyway
.
holden
makes
the
decision
that
he
will
head
out
west
and
live
as
a
deaf-mute
.
when
he
mentions
these
plans
to
his
little
sister
on
monday
morning
she
wants
to
go
with
him
.
holden
declines
her
offer
which
upsets
phoebe
so
holden
decides
not
to
leave
after
all
.
he
tries
to
cheer
her
up
by
taking
her
to
the
central
park
zoo
and
as
he
watches
her
ride
the
zoo
's
carousel
he
is
filled
with
happiness
and
joy
at
the
sight
of
phoebe
riding
in
the
rain
.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
novel
holden
decides
not
to
mention
much
about
the
present
day
finding
it
inconsequential
.
he
alludes
to
``
getting
sick
''
and
living
in
a
sanatorium
and
mentions
he
will
be
attending
another
school
in
september
he
relates
that
he
has
been
asked
whether
he
will
apply
himself
properly
to
his
studies
this
time
around
and
wonders
whether
such
a
question
has
any
meaning
before
the
fact
.
holden
says
that
he
does
n't
want
to
tell
anything
more
because
surprisingly
he
has
found
himself
missing
two
of
his
former
classmates
stradlater
and
ackley
and
even
maurice
the
pimp
who
punched
him
.
he
warns
the
reader
that
telling
others
about
their
own
experiences
will
lead
them
to
miss
the
people
who
shared
them
.

writing
styleedit
the
catcher
in
the
rye
is
written
in
a
subjective
style
from
the
point
of
view
of
holden
caulfield
following
his
exact
thought
processes
.
there
is

in
the
seemingly
disjointed
ideas

episodes

as

looking
at

table

critical
reviews

that
the
novel
accurately
reflected

bruce

held
that
holden
's
attitude

differentiating
the
novel
from

adult
fiction.16

just
a
phase

while
brooks
maintained
that

acts
his
age

claimed
that
holden
thinks
as
an

their
motives

as
when
phoebe
states
that
she

rohrer

rohrer
assessed
the
reasons
behind
both
the
popularity
and
criticism
of
the
book
saying
that
it
``
captures
existential
teenage

has
a
``
complex

``

dislike

1960
a
teacher
in
tulsa
oklahoma
was
fired
for
assigning
the
novel
in
class
however
he
was
later
reinstated.27
between
1961
and
1982
the
catcher
in
the
rye
was
the
most
censored
book
in
high
schools
and
libraries
in
the
united
states.28
the
book
was
banned
in
the
issaquah
washington
high
schools
in
1978
as
being
part
of
an
``
overall
communist
plot
''
.29
in
1981
it
was
both
the
most
censored
book
and
the
second
most
taught
book
in
public
schools
in
the
united
states.30
according
to
the
american
library
association
the
catcher
in
the
rye
was
the
10th
most
frequently
challenged
book
from
1990
to
1999.10
it
was
one
of
the
ten
most
challenged
books
of
200531
and
although
it
had
been
off
the
list
for
three
years
it
reappeared
in
the
list
of
most
challenged
books
of
2009.32
the
challenges
generally
begin
with
holden
's
frequent
use
of
vulgar
language3334
with
other
reasons
including
sexual
references35
blasphemy
undermining
of
family
values34
and
moral
codes36
holden
's
being
a
poor
role
model37
encouragement
of
rebellion38
and
promotion
of
drinking
smoking
lying
and
promiscuity.36
often
the
challengers
have
been
unfamiliar
with
the
plot
itself.28
shelley
keller-gage
a
high
school
teacher
who
faced
objections
after
assigning
the
novel
in
her
class
noted
that
the
challengers
``
are
being
just
like
holden
...
they
are
trying
to
be
catchers
in
the
rye
.
``
34
a
reverse
effect
has
been
that
this
incident
caused
people
to
put
themselves
on
the
waiting
list
to
borrow
the
novel
when
there
were

a
willingness

critically
panned
film
version
of
his

``

''
was
released
renamed
my
foolish

and
taking
great
liberties
with
salinger
's
plot
the
film
is
widely
considered
to
be
among
the
reasons
that
salinger
refused
to
allow
any
subsequent
film
adaptations
of
his
work.1843
the
enduring
popularity
of
the
catcher
in
the
rye
however
has
resulted
in
repeated
attempts
to
secure
the
novel
's
screen
rights.44
when
the
catcher
in
the
rye
was
first
released
many
offers
were
made
to
adapt
it
for
the
screen
including
one
from
samuel
goldwyn
producer
of
my
foolish
heart.43
in
a
letter
written
in
the
early
fifties
j.
d.
salinger
spoke
of
mounting
a
play
in
which
he
would
play
the
role
of
holden
caulfield
opposite
margaret
o'brien
and
if
he
could
n't
play
the
part
himself
to
``
forget
about
it
.
''
almost
fifty
years
later
the
writer
joyce
maynard
definitively
concluded
``
the
only
person
who
might
ever
have
played
holden
caulfield
would
have
been
j.
d
.
salinger
.
``
45
salinger
told
maynard
in
the
seventies
that
jerry
lewis
``
tried
for
years
to
get
his
hands
on
the
part
of
holden
''
45
despite
lewis
not
having
read
the
novel
until
he
was
in
his
thirties.39
celebrities
ranging
from
marlon
brando
and
jack
nicholson
to
tobey
maguire
and
leonardo
dicaprio
have
since
tried
to
make
a
film
adaptation.46
in
an
interview
with
premiere
magazine
john
cusack
commented
that
his
one
regret
about
turning
twenty-one
was
that
he
had
become
too
old
to

caulfield

i
loved

i
pursued

.
i
wanted
to
make
a

and
then
one
day
a
young
man
came
to
the
office
of
leland
hayward
my
agent
in
new
york
and
said
'please
tell
mr.
leland
hayward
to
lay

.
he
's
very
very
insensitive
.
'
and
he
walked
out
.
that
was
the
entire
speech
.
i
never
saw
him
.
that
was
j.
d.
salinger
and
that
was
catcher
in
the
rye.47
in
1961
salinger
denied
elia
kazan
permission
to
direct
a
stage
adaptation
of
catcher
for
broadway.48
more
recently
salinger
's
agents
received
bids
for
the
catcher
movie
rights
from
harvey
weinstein
and
steven
spielberg49
neither
of
which
was
even
passed
on
to
j.
d.
salinger
for
consideration
.
in
2003
the
bbc
television
program
the
big
read
featured
the
catcher
in
the
rye
interspersing
discussions
of
the
novel
with
``
a
series
of
short
films
that
featured
an
actor
playing
j.
d.
salinger
's
adolescent
antihero
holden
caulfield
.
``
48
the
show
defended
its
unlicensed
adaptation
of
the
novel
by
claiming
to
be
a
``
literary
review
''
and
no
major
charges
were
filed
.
after
salinger
's
death
in
2010
phyllis
westberg
who
was
salinger
's
agent
at
harold
ober
associates
stated
that
nothing
has
changed
in
terms
of
licensing
film
television
or
stage
rights
of
his
works.50
a
letter
written
by
salinger
in
1957
revealed
that
he
was
open
to
an
adaptation
of
the
catcher
in
the
rye
released
after
his
death
.
he
wrote
``
firstly
it
is
possible
that
one
day
the
rights
will
be
sold
.
since
there
's
an
ever-looming
possibility
that
i
wo
n't
die
rich
i
toy
very
seriously
with
the
idea
of
leaving
the
unsold
rights
to
my
wife
and
daughter
as
a
kind
of
insurance
policy
.
it
pleasures
me
no

though
i
might
quickly
add
to
know
that
i
wo
n't
have
to
see
the
results
of
the
transaction
.
''
salinger
also
wrote
that
he
believed
his
novel
was
not
suitable
for
film
treatment
and
that
translating
holden
caulfield
's
first-person
narrative
into
voice-over
and
dialogue
would
be
contrived.51
banned

fictionedit
in
2009
a
year
before
his
death
j.
d.
salinger
successfully
sued
to
stop
the
u.s.
publication
of
a
novel
that
presents
holden
caulfield
as
an
old
man.2552
the
novel
's
author
fredrik
colting
commented
``
call
me
an
ignorant
swede

the
last
thing
i
thought
possible

was
that

``
53
the
issue
is
complicated
by
the
nature
of
colting
's
book
60
years
later
coming
through

which
has
been
compared
to
