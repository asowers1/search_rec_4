it
bears
repeating
that
the

is
quite
entertaining
as
children
's
fare
goes

but
disney
has
established
a
standard
so
high

that
anything
less
than
a
classic
leaves
you

this
is
my
first
experience
with
the
lion
king
it
is
a
surprisingly
dark
deep
and
more
complex
movie
than
i
thought
it
would
be
.
there
's
a
reason
why
everyone
loves
it

one

if

do

stop

from
sinking
your

into
'the

there
's
more

½
''
the
lion
king
''
has
been
such
an
important
part
of
so
many
childhoods
since
it
came
out
but
what
is
so
remarkable
is
that
whereas
some
childhood
entertainment
loses
a
lot
of
luster
once
the
nostalgia-goggles
come
off
i
find
my
appreciation
for
this
film
to
grow
the
older
i
get
.
i
personally
do
n't
believe
disney
has
yet
created
a
more
beautiful
film
since
it
is
n't
just
a
detailed
rendition
of
african
wildlife
but
its
such
a
deliriously
colorful
and
expressively
animated
film
to
boot
.
the
story
is
honest
in
its
portrayal
of
the
corruption
that
exists
in
the
world
but
more
importantly
in
the
hope
that
good
moral
judgement
can
overcome
such
corruption
.
the
voice
cast
is
pitch-perfect
the
soundtrack
remains
the
absolute
greatest
in
animated
film
history
and
the
script
while
perhaps
not
wholly
original
deftly
balances
searing
emotional
truths
with
charmingly
silly
antics
.

when
hearing
they
were
remaking
one
of
my
favorite
disney
animated
films
in
3-d
for
its
20th
anniversary
you
can
bet
i
got
hyped
and
boy
did
this
film
not
disappoint
.
i
saw
this
on
opening
day
now
prior
to
hearing
about
this
i
had
n't
seen
the
film
in
about
3
years
so
i
did
n't
want
it
to
be
ruined
if
i
watched
it
the
weeknightmonth
before
seeing
the
film
and
that
was
a
wise
decision
on
my
part
because
the
refreshing
of
my
memory
with
this
film
worked
and
it
was
almost
like
a
new
experience
to
me
.
also
the
3-d
in
this
film
is
incredible
i
'm
rarely
blown
away
by
3-d
but
here
my
god
the
3-d
matched
the
animation
so
perfectly
that
this
film
and
3-d
were
made
for
each
other
.

a

made

with
beautiful
animation
and
a
great
soundtrack

many
of
the
themes
are
for
a
mature
audience
which
is
n't
necessarily
surprising
for
a
disney

it
offers
a
powerful
story
that
can
be

by
