a
magical

however
the
faun
sadly
confesses
to

that
he
invited
her

out
of
hospitality

with
the
intention
of
betraying
her
to
the
white
witch
.
he
explains
that
the
witch
has
ruled
narnia
for
years
and
during
her
reign
has
used
evil
magic
to
make
it
always
the
same
season
winter
.
as
tumnus
explains
it
is
``
always
winter
but
never
christmas
.
''
the
witch
has
ordered
all
narnians
to
report
or
capture
any
sons
of
adam
or
daughters
of
eve
which
is
how
narnians
refer
to
human
beings
.
mr
tumnus

intention
had
been
to
obey
that
order
and
hand
lucy
over

now
that
he
has
met
a
real
human
mr
tumnus
feels
incapable

discovers
that
only
a

he
tells
the
three
siblings
that
he
knew
from

look
on
edmund
's
face
that
he
had
been
in
the
witch
's
company
.
knowing
the

peter
is
given
a
sword
.
aslan
welcomes
the
children
and
the
beavers
to
his
camp
at
the
stone
table
and
peter
is
soon
required
to
make
use
of
his
new
sword
by
killing
maugrim
the
chief
wolf
of
jadis
'
secret
police
who
tries
to
kill
susan
.
peter
is
victorious
and
aslan
makes
him
a
knight
.
aslan
's
troops
run
after
a
second
wolf
that
runs
away
and
it
leads
them
to
the
enemy
camp
where
they
rescue
edmund
just
as
jadis
is
about
to
kill
him
.
edmund
is
brought
back
to
aslan
's
camp
to
join
the
others
and
jadis
approaches
in
truce
to
parley
with
aslan
insisting
that
according
to
``
deep
magic
from
the
dawn
of
time
''
she
has
the
right
to
execute
edmund
for
treason
.
aslan
speaks
with
her
privately
and
persuades
her
to
renounce
her
claim
.
that
evening
aslan
secretly
leaves
the
camp
but
lucy
and
susan
follow
him
.
it
appears
that
aslan
has
bargained
his
own
life
for
edmund
's
for
the
girls
witness
jadis
tie
aslan
to
the
stone
table
and
kill
him
with
a
knife
.
the
next
morning
the
enemies
are
gone
and
only
susan
and
lucy
remain
weeping
over
aslan
's
body
when
some
mice
come
and
bite
through
the
ropes
the
enemy
had
used
to
tie
him
.
then
the
stone
table
is
broken
and
aslan
is
restored
to
life
telling
lucy
and
susan
that
``
deeper
magic
from
before
the
dawn
of
time
''
which
jadis
did
not
know
about
will
resurrect
an
innocent
killed
in
place
of
a
traitor
.
aslan
allows
lucy
and
susan
to
ride
on
his
back
as
he
hurries
to
jadis
'
castle
.
there
he
breathes
upon
the
statues
restoring
them
to
life
.
meanwhile
peter
and
edmund
are
leading
the

and
many
of
the
loyal
narnians
are
being
turned
to

edmund
attacks
jadis
and
destroys
her
wand

no
longer
able
to
turn
soldiers
to

fights
with
the
stone
knife
instead

is
seriously
wounded

aslan
arrives
with
the
former
statues
as
reinforcements
.
the
narnians
rout
jadis

army
and
aslan
kills
jadis
.
aslan
walks
around
the
battlefield
breathing
on
those
who
have
been
turned
to
stone
to
bring
them
back
to
life
and
lucy
uses
her
magic
cordial
to
revive
first
edmund
and
then
all
the
others
who
have
been
wounded

writingedit
lewis
described
the
origin
of
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
in
an
essay
entitled
it
all
began
with
a
picture9
the
lion
all
began
with
a
picture
of
a
faun
carrying
an
umbrella
and
parcels
in
a
snowy
wood
.
this
picture
had
been
in
my
mind
since
i
was
about
sixteen
.
then
one
day
when
i
was
about
forty
i
said
to
myself
'let
's
try
to
make
a
story
about
it
.
'
shortly
before
world
war
ii
many
children
were
evacuated
from
london
to
the
english
countryside
to
escape
bomber
attacks
on
london
by
nazi
germany
.
on
2
september
1939
three
school
girls
margaret
mary
and
katherine1011
came
to
live
at
the
kilns
in
risinghurst
lewis
's
home
three
miles
east
of
oxford
city
centre
.
lewis
later
suggested
that
the
experience
gave
him
a
new
appreciation
of
children
and
in
late
september12
he
began
a
children
's
story
on
an
odd
sheet
which
has
survived
as
part
of
another
manuscript
this
book
is
about
four
children
whose
names
were
ann
martin
rose
and
peter
.
but
it
is
most
about
peter
who
was
the
youngest
.
they
all
had
to
go
away
from
london
suddenly
because
of
air
raids
and
because
father
who
was
in
the
army
had
gone
off
to
the
war
and
mother
was
doing
some
kind
of
war
work
.
they
were
sent
to
stay
with
a
kind
of
relation
of
mother
's
who
was
a
very
old
professor
who
lived
all
by
himself
in
the
country.13
the
plot
element
of
entering
a
new
world
through
the
back
of
a
wardrobe
had
certainly
entered
lewis
's
mind
by
1946
when
he
used
it
to
describe
his
first
encounter
with
really
good
poetry
i
did
not
in
the
least
feel
that
i
was
getting
in
more
quantity
or
better
quality
a
pleasure
i
had
already
known
.
it
was
more
as
if
a
cupboard
which
one
had
hitherto
valued
as
a
place
for
hanging
coats
proved
one
day
when
you
opened
the
door
to
lead
to
the
garden
of
the
hesperides
...
14
how
much
more
of
the
story
lewis
then
wrote
is
uncertain
.
roger
lancelyn
green
thinks
that
he
might
even
have
completed
it
.
in
september
1947
c.
s.
lewis
wrote
in
a
letter
about
stories
for
children
``
i
have
tried
one
myself
but
it
was
by
the
unanimous
verdict
of
my
friends
so
bad
that
i
destroyed
it
.
``
15
in
august
1948
during
the
visit
of
the
american
writer
chad
walsh
lewis
vaguely
talked
about
completing
a
children
's
book
which
he
had
begun
``
in
the
tradition
of
e.
nesbit
''
.16
after
this
conversation
not
much
happened
â
until
the
beginning
of
the
next
year
.
then
everything
changed
.
in
his
essay
it
all
began
with
a
picture
c.
s.
lewis
continues
``
at
first
i
had
very
little
idea
how
the
story
would
go
.
but
then
suddenly
aslan
came
bounding
into
it
.
i
think
i
had
been
having
a
good
many
dreams
of
lions
about
that
time
.
apart
from
that
i
do
n't
know
where
the
lion
came
from
or
why
he
came
.
but
once
he
was
there
he
pulled
the
whole
story
together
and
soon
he
pulled
the
six
other
narnian
stories
in
after
him
.

at

after
the
meal
lewis
read
two
chapters
from
his
new
children
's
story
to
green
.
lewis
asked
green
's
opinion
of
the
tale
and
green
thought
it
was
good
.
the
manuscript
of
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
was
complete
by
the
end
of
march
1949
.
lucy

illustrationsedit
lewis
's
publisher
geoffrey
bles
allowed
him
to
choose
the
illustrator
for
the
novel
and
the
narnia
series
.
lewis
chose
pauline
baynes
possibly
based
on
j.
r.
r.
tolkienâs
recommendation
.
baynes
had
greatly
impressed
tolkien
with
her
illustrations
for
his
farmer
giles
of
ham
1949
.
however
baynes
claimed
that
lewis
learned
about
her
work
after
going
into
a
bookshop
and
asking
for
a
recommendation
for
an
illustrator
who
was
skilled
at
portraying
both
humans
and
animals
.
in
december
1949
bles
showed
lewis
the
first
drawings
for
the
novel
and
lewis
sent
baynes
a
note
congratulating
her
particularly
on
the
level
of
detail
.
lewisâs
appreciation
of
the
illustrations
is
evident
in
a
letter
he
wrote
to
baynes
after
the
last
battle
won
the
carnegie
medal
for

receptionedit
lewis
very
much
enjoyed
writing
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
and
embarked
on
the
sequel
prince
caspian
soon
after
finishing
the
first
novel
.
he
completed
the
sequel
in
less
than
a
year
by
the
end
of
1949
.
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
had
not
been
widely
released
until
1950
thus
his
initial
enthusiasm
did
not
stem
from
favourable
reception
by
the
public.22
while
lewis
is
known
today
on
the
strength
of
the
narnia
stories
as
a
highly
successful
childrenâs
writer
the
initial
critical
response
was
muted
.
at
the
time
it
was
fashionable
for
childrenâs
stories
to
be
realistic
fantasy
and
fairy
tales
were
seen
as
indulgent
appropriate
only
for
very
young
readers
and
potentially
harmful
to
older
children
even
hindering
their
ability
to
relate
to
everyday
life
.
some
reviewers
considered
the
tale
overtly
moralistic
or
the
christian
elements
over-stated
â
attempts
to
indoctrinate
children
.
others
were
concerned
that
the
many
violent
incidents
might
frighten
children.23
lewisâ
publisher
geoffrey
bles
feared
the
narnia
tales
would
not
sell
and
might
damage
lewisâ
reputation
and
affect
sales
of
his
other
books
.
nevertheless
the
novel
and
its
successors
were
highly
popular
with
young
readers
and
lewisâ
publisher
was
soon
anxious
to
release
further
narnia
stories.24
a
2004
study
found
that
it
was
a
common
read-aloud
book
for
seventh-graders
in

in

the

scenes
that
can

precursors
to
sequences
presenting
jadis
particularly
in

nesbit

includes
the
motif
of

gain
access
to
a
magical
place.37
the
freeing
of

from

by

is
reminiscent
of
