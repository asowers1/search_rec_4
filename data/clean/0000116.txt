with
them
.
fiver
warns
the
rabbits
not
to
join

but
they
do
not
listen

and
there

.
there

from
the
rabbits
who
live
in
the
warren
.
fiver
figures
it

a
farmer
leaves
the
great
food
behind
for
the
rabbits
in
order
to
fatten
them
up
before
he
catches

snares
.
they
decide
to
leave
and
one
rabbit
from
the
new
warren
strawberry
comes
with
them
.
the
rabbits
travel
on
until
they
reach
watership
down
.
at
the
top
there
is
a
perfect
field
for
a
rabbit
warren
.
they
settle
down
in
the
field
but
then
hazel
realizes
that
they
need
does
female
rabbits
to
mate
with
as
they
have
only
bucks
and
their
warren
will
not
last
long
without
does
.
holly
and
bluebell
two
survivors
from
their
home
warren
find
the
rabbits
and
tell
them
of
a
horrible
poisoning
that
occurred
.
the
rabbits
befriend
a
wounded
bird
kehaar
and
after
he
heals
he
searches
for
other
warrens
so
they
can
get
some
does
.
kehaar
finds
a
warren
a
few
days
away
as
well
as
some
rabbits
living
in
the
farm
next
to
the
down
.
the
rabbits
send
an
expedition
to
the
warren
efrafa
to
try
to
bring
back
some
does
and
hazel
sets
up
a
raid
to
free
the
rabbits
in
the
farm
.
the
get
three
of
the
four
rabbits
out
although
hazel
is
badly
injured
and
thought
dead
until
fiver
goes
back
and
saves
him
.
the
expedition
comes
back
roughed
up
describing
efrafa
as
a
horrible
warren
run
by
a
militaristic
warlord
general
woundwort
.
hazel
decides
that
they
must
go
to
efrafa
and
get
some
does
because
otherwise
they
will
not
survive
.
he
has
blackberry
come
up
with
a
plan
and
then
the
group
sets
off
leaving
behind
a
few
rabbits
at
the
warren
.
along
with
blackberry
they
sneak
to
a
hiding
place
close
to
efrafa
at
which
time
bigwig
enters
the
warren
pretending
to
be
a
solitary
rabbit
.
he
finds
a
doe
hyzenthlay
who
helps
him
set
up
a
plan
to
escape
.
with
the
help
of
kehaar
and
his
own
strength
and
cunning
bigwig
engineers
a
masterful
escape
and
the
whole
groups
flees
on
a
boat
just
as
general
woundwort
is
about
to
attack
them
.
however
on
the
way
back
to
watership
down
a
patrol
from
efrafa
bumps
into
them
and
captain
campion
tracks
them
and
finds
their
warren
.
soon
after
they
return
a
mouse
whom
hazel
had
earlier
saved
brings
him
news
that
there
is
a
large
number
of
rabbits
close
by
.
they
realize
that
the
efrafans
have
brought
a
large
force
to
destroy
them
.
hazel
immediately
sets
the
rabbits
to
work
preparing
to
defend
the
warren
.
they
bury
themselves
in
and
prepare
to
fight
off
the
invaders
even
though
they
know
it
will
likely
cost
them
their
lives
.
hazel
gets
a
flash
of
inspiration
and
runs
off
with
dandelion
and
blackberry
to
try
to
release
the
dog
from
the
farmhouse
and
get
him
to
attack
the
efrafan
rabbits
.
meanwhile
bigwig
faces
woundwort
in
a
tremendous
battle
.
woundwort
is
bigger
and
stronger
than
any
other
rabbit
but
bigwig
defeats
him
and
soon
afterward
the
dog
comes
and
scatters
the
efrafan
forces
.
a
cat
catches
hazel
but
the
girl
who
lives
at
the
farm
saves
the
rabbit
and
lets
him
go
.
the
rabbits
live
happily
in
their
warren
and
campion
returns
to
run
the
efrafan
warren
.
they
decide
to
build
a
third
warren
halfway
between
the
two
and
fill
it
with
rabbits
from
each
warren
.
hazel
lives
several
years
longer
than
most
rabbits
live
and
he
sees
the
warren
prosper
and
thrive
before
he
dies
.
