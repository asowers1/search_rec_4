been
invited
by
fiona
's
parents
john
cleese
and
julie
andrews
to
the
family
castle
.
imagine
their
surprise
when
the
honeymooning
ogres
show
up
seems
the
king
and
queen
have
n't
heard
that
a
fiona
's
an
ogre
and
b
that
her
husband
is
one
too
.
naturally
this
does
n't
sit
particularly
well
with
the
king
and
soon
he
's
hired
a
hit
man
-
puss
in
boots
no
less
voiced
by
antonio
banderas
-
to
bump
off
his
new
son
in
law
.
meanwhile
a
fairy
godmother
jennifer
saunders
offers
help
to
fiona
.
and
quickly
the
main
question
of
the
film
-
conveniently
it
was
the
main
question
of
the
first
film
-
is
whether
love
conquers
all
.
oh
perhaps
it
's
a
bit
more
complex
than
that
-
perhaps
it
's
whether
fiona
would
love
shrek
no
matter
what
he
looked
like
.
come
to
think
of
it
that
was
the
theme
of
the
first
one
as
well
.
shrek
and
fiona
journey
to
the
land
of
far
far
away
where
the
stuffy
king
and
the
queen
mum
live
.
far
far
away
is
a
clear
knockoff
of
hollywood
itself
complete
with
the
sign
on
the
mountain
and
the
journey
includes
a
pass
through
what
looks
like
beverly
hills
.
the
attention
to
detail
is
marvelous
as
always.as
with
1
2
drops
all
sorts
of
disney
references
most
resulting
in
full-out
belly
laughter
.
i
was
in
stitches
although
perhaps
-
just
perhaps
-
some
of
the
humor
will
zoom
over
your
tiny
tot
's
tiny
head.shrek
2
is
a
beautifully
done
movie
perhaps
even
more
entertaining
than
the
original
.
sure
at
the
end
you
know
your
emotions
have
been
manipulated
somewhat
but
in
the
end
you
really
do
n't
care
.
outstanding
voice
performances
flawless
animation
and
a
crisp
moderately
adult
but
not
mature
definitely
not
mature
script
reign
supreme
.
