has
stated
that
originally
they
were
planning
on
having
chris
rock
be
in
the
music
video
but
he
wanted
sacha
baron
cohen
instead.34
he
said
that
at
that
time
baron
cohen
was
n't
known
at
all
in
america
so
he
had
to
get
everybody
tapes
of
the
da
ali
g
show
so
they
could
see
the
ali
g
character
.
he
added
that
once
they
got
a
chance
to
see
the
show
``
everybody
loved
it
''
and
sacha
was
on
a
plane
right
away
to
los
angeles
to
shoot
the
video.34
when
we
did
the
'music
'
video
it
was
a
weird
time
.
she
was
pregnant
and
we
did
n't
want
her
to
look
pregnant
â
so
we
had
to
work
around
that
.
we
had
an
idea
to
do
a
fun
party
video
with
her
and
her
girls
make
it
a
little
bling
and
cowboy
hats
and
all
that
.
we
wanted
to
have
some
comedy
in
there
and
i
wanted
to
do
some
animation.34

later
to
a
strip-club
where
he
is
denied
entrance
.
an
animated
section
follows
where
madonna
as
a
superheroine
character
with
superpowers
flies
above
rooftops
swims
underwater
and
djs
at

club
with
a
dozen
arms
like
a

traveling
in
the

with
many
of

humorous
twist
throughout
the

wears
a
gold
necklace
around
her
neck
that
says
``
mommy
.
``
39
in

there
is
a
variation
at
the
end
of

animated
section
.
ali
g
briefly
interrupts
the
song
to
demonstrate
his
rap
skills
to
persuade

an
annoyed
madonna
asks
him

stop
