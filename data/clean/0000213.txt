invited
to
a
royal
ball
thrown
by
fiona
's
parents
to
celebrate
their
marriage
.
shrek
is
reluctant
to
participate
reasoning
that
he
is
worried
about
how
fiona
's
parents
would
react
to
her
new
look
.
donkey
appears
wanting
to
move
in
with
them
after
a
fall-out
with

to
their
consternation
.
they
all
travel
to
the
kingdom
of
far

and
meet
fiona
's
parents
king
harold
and
queen
lillian
who
are
surprised
by
fiona
's
choice
of
husband
and
her
new
appearance
.
harold
is
repulsed
and
at
a
family
dinner
he
and
shrek
get
into
a
heated
argument
over
how
shrek
and
fiona
will
raise
their
family
.
fiona
disgusted
at
their
behavior
locks
herself
in
her
room
where
she
meets
her
fairy
godmother
who
is
also
startled
by
fiona
's
new
looks
and
marriage
.
subsequently
king
harold
is
accosted
by
the
fairy
godmother
and
prince
charming
her
son
.
he
had
arranged
with
the
fairy
godmother
that
charming
would
marry
fiona
and
they
demand
that
he
gets
rid
of
shrek
.
shrek
worries
that
he
and
fiona
are
n't
meant
to
be
particularly
after
finding
a
diary
from
her
pre-teenager
years
and
discovering
that
she
was
once
infatuated
with
prince
charming
.
harold
arranges
for
shrek
and
donkey
to
join
him
on
a
hunting
trip
which
is
really
a
trap
to
lure
the
two
into
the
hands
of
an
assassin
puss
in
boots
.
when
fiona
realizes
that
shrek
left
she
asks
her
father
for
help
but
he
replies
that
he
always
wanted
the
best
for
her
and
that
she
should
think
about
that
too
.
puss
is
unable
to
defeat
shrek
and
reveals
that
he
was
paid
by
harold
.
he
asks
to
tag
along
as
a
way
to
make
amends
.
shrek
decides
to
go
to
the
fairy
godmother
for
help
.
however
the
fairy
godmother
states
that
ogres
do
not
live
``
happily
ever
after
''
and
refuses
to
assist
him
.
nonetheless
the
three
sneak
into
the
fairy
godmother
's
potion
factory
and
steal
a
``
happily
ever
after
''
potion
that
shrek
believes
will
ensure
a
happy
ending
for
his
marriage
.
shrek
and
donkey
both
drink
the
potion
which
does
n't
appear
to
work
.
they
wait
out
the
storm
in
a
barn
and
shrek
and
donkey
become
dizzy
and
fall
over
into
a
deep
sleep
.
the
next
morning
the
potion
has
taken
effect
shrek
is
now
a
handsome
human
while
donkey
has
turned
into
a
white
stallion
.
to
make
the
change
permanent
shrek
must
kiss
fiona
by
midnight
.
shrek
donkey
and
puss
return
to
the
castle
to
discover
that
the
potion
has
also
transformed
fiona
back
into
her
former
human
self
.
however
the
fairy
godmother
having
learned
of
the
potion
's
theft
sends
charming
to
the
castle
where
he
poses
as
shrek
to
win
fiona
's
love
.
although
harold
recognizes
charming
for
who
he
really
is
he
does
n't
speak
up
.
shrek
heartbroken
lets
fiona
go
believing
she
will
be
happier
with
charming
.
a
few
hours
later
shrek
overhears
harold
telling
the
fairy
godmother
that
fiona
has
n't
fallen
for
charming
.
she
gives
him
a
love
potion
for
fiona
which
will
cause
her
to
fall
in
love
with
the
first
person
she
kisses
.
harold
at
first
refuses
but
the
fairy
godmother
threatens
to
take
away
his
own
``
happily
ever
after
''
if
he
does
not
listen
to
her
.
after
hearing
that
charming
is
the
fairy
godmother
's
son
the
trio
is
noticed
by
the
fairy
godmother
who
has
them
arrested
by
the
royal
guards
and
thrown
into
a
dungeon
.
when
the
royal
ball
begins
several
of
shrek
's
friends
band
together
to
free
the
trio
having
seen
their
arrest
via
the
magic
mirror
and
help
shrek
stop
the
kiss
.
the
muffin
man
helps
them
create
a
gigantic
gingerbread
man
named
mongo
who
breaks
through
the
castle
's
defenses
.
however
he
falls
into
the
moat
.
when
shrek
arrives
charming
forcibly
kisses
fiona
believing
the
potion
has
taken
effect
but
fiona
temporarily
knocks
him
out
with
a
headbutt
.
when
the
fairy
godmother
confronts
harold
he
reveals
that
he
drank
the
potion
himself
at
the
last
minute
having
realized
fiona
's
love
for
shrek
.
the
fairy
godmother
tries
to
kill
shrek
but
harold
sacrifices
himself
to
save
the
couple
.
the
spell
reflects
off
his
armor
and
kills
the
fairy
godmother
into
a
cloud
of
bubbles
and
tears
it
also
reverts
harold
to
his
true
form
that
of
the
frog
prince
.
harold
apologizes
to
shrek
and
fiona
for
everything
he
has
done
and
now
realizes
what
is
best
for
fiona
giving
them
his
blessing
.
shrek
forgives
him
and
lillian
tells
harold
that
she
still
loves
him
no
matter
what
.
when
it
is
midnight
shrek
tells
fiona
that
if
they
kiss
now
then
their
change
will
be
permanent
.
but
fiona
says
that
she
wants
what
any
other
princess
wants
to
live
happily
ever
after
with
the
ogre
she
married
.
the
clock
chimes
as
the
potion
's
effects
wear
off
with
donkey
changing
back
as
well
much
to
his
chagrin
.
he
cheers
up
as
shrek
reassures
him
he
still
is
a
noble
steed
in
his
eyes
.
finally
puss
and
donkey
sing
as
the
royal
ball
resumes
celebrating
the
true
newlyweds
.
in
a
post-credits
scene
donkey
complains
to
puss
about
missing
dragon
and
rejects
his
invitation
to
a
night-cap
at
the
``
kit-kat
club
.
''
suddenly
dragon
flies
in
along
with
six
``
dronkeys
''
that
donkey
happily
embraces
as
his
``
mutant
babies
''
and
donkey
and
dragon
reconcile

productionedit
in
july
2001
it
was
reported
that
the
main
cast
of
the
original
shrek
were
set
for
huge
paychecks
for
voicing
a
sequel
to
the
film.9
following
a
successful
collaboration
with
the
original
film
eddie
murphy
had
signed
a
two-year
first-look
production
deal
with
dreamworks
where
he
also
signed
writer-director
todd
field
to
a
two-year
deal.10
the
film
was
produced
with
a
us70
million
budget.1112
the
screenwriters
for
the
first
film
ted
elliott
and
terry
rossio
insisted
the
film
to
be
a
traditional
fairytale
but
after
disagreements
with
the
producers
they
left
the
project
and
was
taken
over
by
director
andrew
adamson
.
his
writing
of
the
film
was
inspired
from
guess
who
's
coming
to
dinner
with
the
help
of
the
co-directors
for
the
film
who
had
spent
most
of
the
film
's
production
in
northern
california
while
adamson
spent
most
of
the
time
with
the
voice
actors
in
glendale
california.13
dreamworks
began
production
in
200114
which
was
actually
before
the
first
film
was
even
completed.13
dreamworks
made
sure
there
was
something
new
to
see
in
shrek
2
by
putting
more
human
characters
in
the
film
than
there
were
in
its
predecessor
and
improving
their
appearance
with
the
use
of
a
few
systems
that
dealt
with
hair
and
fur
to
improve
its
appearance
and
movement.15
the
set
up
for
all
the
characters
was
done
in
the
first
3
years
of
production.13
puss
in
boots
required
a
whole
new
set
of
tools
in
the
film
to
handle
his
fur
belt
and
feather
plume
in
his
hat
.
the
character
also
required
an
upgrade
in
the
fur
shader
for
his
introduction
in
the
film.16
according
to
production
designer
guillaume
aretos
shrek
2
appeared
to
be
a
lot
darker
than
the
original
film
``
there
are
a
lot
of
medieval
paintings
and
illustrations
that
we
used
quite
a
bit
also
.
other
than
that
there
are
my
own
influences
which
are
classical
paintings
from
the
15th
and
16th
centuries
but
those
are
not
as
direct
.
in
fact
nothing
was
absolutely
direct
.
the
design
of
shrek
is
always
a
twist
on
reality
anyway
so
we
tried
to
pack
as
much
detail
and
interest
as
we
could
in
the
imagery.â17

cultural
referencesedit
like

shrek

also
acts
as
somewhat
of
a
parody
film
targeting
adapted
children
's
fantasies
mainly
those
adapted
by
disney
and
like
other
dreamworks
animated
films
also
features
references

washes

makes
an
evil
chuckle

when

busted
in
