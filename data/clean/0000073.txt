hard
for
people
to

the
fact
that
this
is
more
than
a
story
about

an

man

this
is
a

a
very

one

if
you
've
only
heard
of
``
lolita
''
from
its
reputation
as
being
``
pornographic
''
you
are
in
for
a
surprise
when
you
read
it
.
yes
it
involves
a
lecherous
middle
aged
man
chasing
after
a
12
year
old
``
nymphet
''
.
yes
it
is
deeply
disturbing
and
makes
one
queasy
at
times
.
it
is
also
a
brilliant
funny
witty
literary
rollercoaster
which
will
delight
you
and
dazzle
you
with
the
beauty
of
language
.
nabakov
can
make
words
jump
through
hoops
you
never
even
knew
existed
while
he
explores
the
dark
realms
of
obsession
and
longing.the
narrator
humbert
humbert
is
a
fascinating
construction
.
as
readers
we
find
ourselves
simultaneously
repelled
by
his
actions
and
sympathetic
to
his
yearning
.
we
are
utterly
charmed
by
his
wit
intelligence
and
verbal
acrobatics
sometimes
to
the
point
where
we
lost
sight
of
what
he
's
doing
to
his
object
of
desire
lolita.i
would
suggest
that
all
readers
reaquaint
themselves
with
the
concept
of
the
``
unreliable
narrator
''
before
they
sink
into
humbert
's
hypnotic
web
of
logic
.
when
you
find
yourself
sympathizing
with
hum
about
lolita
's
``
cruelties
''
try
to
remember
that
you
are
seeing
everything
through
his
twisted
and
self-serving
lens
.
humbert
has
rationalized
his
behavior
so
deeply
and
reports
it
to
us
so
entertainingly
that
we
find
ourselves
accepting
his
interpretations
of
people
and
events
at
face
value
.
however
we
must
remember
that
hum
is
capable
of
the
most
monsterous
of
deceptions
note
how
long
it
takes
him
to
inform
lolita
of
her
mother
's
demise
and
of
self
deceptions
.
read
between
the
lines

question
his
reading

pay
attention
when
his
reporting
is
at

''
i
on
my
part
was
as
naive
as
only
a
pervert
can
be
.
''
by
folantin

of

on

2003format
paperback
verified
purchase
i
have
no
real
excuse
for
not
reading
``
lolita
''
before
this
late
date
.
it
's
certainly
a
book
that
crops
up
in
conversation
a
great
deal
.
i
watched
the
james
mason
film
version
of
the
book
years
ago
--
perhaps
that
's
what
put
me
off
.
i
recently
watched
the
jeremy
irons
version
and
loved
it
.
i
suppose
part
of
me
asked
why
myself
why
i
'd
want
to
read
a
book
that
is
essentially
the
ramblings
of
a
middle-aged
pervert
.
anyway
i
decided
that
i
'd
procrastinated
long
enough
and
it
was
time
to
get
serious
and
find
out
what
all
the
fuss
is
about.the
story
is
narrated
by
middle-aged
humbert
humbert
.
he
's
a
pedophile
--
although
he
's
tried
denying
it
tried
disguising
it
and
tried
channeling
his
baser
instincts
but
as
luck
would
have
it
humbert
finds
himself
as
the
lodger
at
the
home
of
a
buxom
lonely
widow
charlotte
haze
and
12-year-old
daughter
lolita
.
humbert
does
n't
particularly
even
like
lolita
--
he
actually
finds
her
rather
dull
but
she
becomes
a
vessel
for
the
fantasies
left
by
humbert
's
unfulfilled
first
love
affair.due
to
the
subject
matter
the
book
was
at
times
rather
difficult
to
read
and
it
is
a
tribute
to
nabokov
's
skill
as
a
writer
that
i
was
gripped
by
this
story
.
humbert
humbert
is
at
his
most
'human
'
introspective
during
his
pre-
and
post-lolita
phases
.
once
humbert
crosses
the
boundaries
of
ethical
behaviour
and
begins
a
physical
relationship
with
lolita
there
is
no
going
back
.
at
times
humbert
congratulates
himself
for
his
cleverness
and
calls
himself
a
``
magician
''
and
then
at
other
times
humbert
seems
to
realize
how
despicable
he
truly
is
.
unfortunately
the
occasional
flash
of
insight
is
too
pale
and
fleeting
to
release
humbert
from
his
obsession
with
his
``
nymphet
''
and
so
humbert
accepts
his
enslavement
and
ultimate
fate.read

this
is
a
magnificent
book
in
many
ways
most
of
which
have
been
commented
on
--
often
brilliantly
--
by
amazon
reviewers
.
i
would
therefore
like
to
restrict
my
comments
to
the
morality
of
the
book
and
to
those
who
to
this
day
view
the
book
with
outrage
.
even
those
who
admire
the
book
somehow
feel
compelled
to
comment
that
they
are
``
disturbed
''
by
it
.
why
is
this
let
us
first
examine
the
novel
itself.as
everybody
knows
it
is
the
story
of
humbert
humbert
a
full-grown
adult
male
--
not
an
old
man
--
who
seduces
a
compliant
twelve-year
old
girl
and
then
goes
on
to
have
a
year
or
so
long
``
affair
''
with
her
.
i
put
the
term
``
affair
''
in
quotation
marks
because
it
probably
is
n't
appropriate
to
describe
a
sexual
relationship
between
a
full
grown
male
and
a
female
child
in
such
terms
.
is
it
safe
to
say
that
most
rational
human
beings
disapprove
of
such
relationships
it
is
certainly
safe
to
say
that
nabakov
--
and
his
narrator
--
know
that
such
relationships
are
wrong
.
this
is
important
.
the
tale
is
not
only
told
in
the
context
of
a
moral
universe
it
is
also
told
by
a
character
who
is
in
acceptance
of
a
moral
universe
.
oh
he
makes
a
comment
here
and
there
about
some
medieval
king
marrying
his
twelve
year
old
cousin
but
clearly
his
heart
is
n't
in
it
.
he
knows
that
he
is
a
monster
a
``
brute
.
``
indeed
his
goal
was
never
to
have
sex
with
a
conscious
lolita
to
begin
with
.
his
goal
initially
was
only
to
fondle
her
after
drugging
her
to
induce
sleep
she
was
never
to
know
what
he
was
doing
.
of
course
this
is
also
reprehensible
but
clearly
it
shows
a
conscience
at
work
.
a
conscience
motivated
in
part
by
fear
to
be
sure
but
also
a
conscience
for
the
welfare
--
at
least
early
on
--
of
this
little
girl
.
conscience
is
not
normally
a
factor
in
purely
prurient
forms
of
entertainment.read

i
do
n't
think
some
ppl
understand
why
this
book
is
good
simply
put
the
reader
thinks
of
humbert
as
a
good
but
tragic
figure
because
humbert
says
he
is
.
the
reader
readily
buys
into
humbert
's
idea
of
himself
even
though

i

...
i
picked
up
lolita
based
more
on
intrigue
than
anything
having
heard
brilliant

and
controversy
often
attracts
me
