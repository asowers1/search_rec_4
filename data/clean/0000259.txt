like

about

the

the
best

do

come
down
on
one
side

total
recall
ultimately
had
enough
clues
indicating
the
``

the
matrix
stumbled
after
it
made
it
clear
that
reality

fiction
thereby
losing
an
audience
who
enjoyed
the
tantalizing
mystery
.
like
so
many
mysteries
once
the
truth
was
revealed
it
was
n't
quite
as
exciting
as
we
all
hoped
.
inception
wisely
avoids
providing
answers.inception
is
also
a
thought
experiment
.
the
central
conceit
of
inception
is
that
once
you
put
a
thought
in
someone
's
head
it
's
like
a
virus
incapable
of
being
removed
.
in
fact
attempting
to
not
think
about
the
idea
causes
the
mind
to
just
focus

it

this
concept
a
key
tenet

neuro-linguistic

exactly
what
he
's

this
movie
was
original
well-written
and
well-acted
.
the
story
was
creative
fresh
and
engrossing
.
one
of
the
best
films
i
have
seen
in
years
.
i
really
do
n't
understand
the
bad
reviews
on
here
.
i
realize
you
can
not
please
everyone
but
calling
this
movie
``
terrible
''
or
saying
that
the
experience
of
watching
it
was
``
nightmare
''
seems
a
bit
extreme
.
if
you
do
n't
like
something
that
's
cool
.
i
get
that
.
say
something
like
``
i
did
n't
like
it
not
my
type
of
movie
''
or
``
the
effects
were
cool
but
i
did
n't
think
the
story
made
sense
''
or
``
this
movie
was
n't
what
i
expected
here
is
what
i
was
looking
for
...
''
those
types
of
comments
can
be
helpful
.
but
saying
the
movie
is
shyte
or
saying
``
i
hate
it
''
or
``
it
sucks
''
is
not
very
helpful.i
liked
this
movie
because
it
was
not
like
anything
i
have
seen
before
.
i
thought
it
was
exciting
and
engaging
the
story
really
pulled
me
in
and
held
me
tight
never
letting
go
until
the
credits
rolled
.
lots
of
good
action
and
effects
but
the
story
and
the
acting
is
what
separates
this
movie
from
other
lesser
flicks
.
the
performances
were
fantastic
i
am
not
a
huge
dicaprio
fan
but
he
has
done
some
great
work
here.i
watched
this
movie
with
my

blu-ray
this
is
one
of
the
best
movies
i
saw
this
year
.
the
plot
is
deep
and
very
detailed
.
the
movie
can
seem
confusing
to
some
but
watching
twice
really
is
worth
it
.
you
'll
definitely
catch
anything
little
detailed
you
missed

first

christopher
nolan
's
writing
and
directing
skills
have
always
been
great
and
they
will
not
disappoint
in
this
movie
.
the
movie
is
mind
boggling
and
definitely
worth
the
purchase.as
for
the
steelbook
the
packaging
is
great

it
includes
2

blu-ray
blu-rayi
just
finished
watching
inception
for
the
second
time
.
the
blu-ray
is
amazing
.
the
pq
and
aq
are
perfect
in
every
way
.
i
did
notice
that
the
video
was
not
as
sharp
crisp
or
clear
as
the
dark
knight
.
however
it
was
very
very
good
.
the
audio
is
very
bass
heavy
but
is
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
blu-ray
aq
i
have
heard
.
the
movie
was
stunning
all
the
way
through
and
after
another
watch
it
is
just
as
good
if
not
better
than
the
first
time
i
watched
it.the
special
features
are
great
.
disc
two
is
full
of
behind
the
scenes
and
a
dream
documentary
by
joseph
gordon-levitt
.
on
the
first
disc
there
is
expansion
mode
which
takes
you
behind
the
scenes
and
shows
you
each
special
effects
scene
and
all
which
went
into
creating
it
.
it
is
really
interesting
to
watch
.
very
little
cgi
special
effects
were
used
on
this
film
.
they
actually
did
most
of
the
stunts
or
build
huge
models
.
it
was
really
cool
to
watch.moviei
went
into
inception
thinking
very
positive
and
with
high
hopes
that
this
will
be
one
of
my
new
favorite
movies
.
i
based
this
simply
on
the
trailer
.
i
was
not
let
down
in
the
slightest
and
i
was
blown
away
by
the
originality
and
creativity
of
the
film
.
the
directing
acting
and
cinematography
were
all
amazing
.
it
is
a
beautiful
film.after
seeing
inception
i
will
have
a
hard
time
watching
any
other
movie
ever
again
.
anything
else
would
seem
boring
and
useless
.
i
went
to
see
the
expendables
in
theaters
.
horrible
.
i
could
n't
understand
what
the
interest
in
this
film
was
.
it
was
just
violence
and
explosions
no
story
or
plot
.
just
useless
violence.i
can
see
where
people
may
think
of
inception
as
something
similar
to
the
theme
of
the
matrix.read
