hardcover
an
excellent
read
but
it
's
truly
sad
to
think
that
some
readers
assume
that
dan
brown
's
contrived
history
is
factual
and
would
even
base
their
spiritual
beliefs
on
a
book
of
fiction
.
just
read
some
of
the
other
reviews
to
see
what
i
'm
talking
about
.
it
reminds
of
the
guy
who
watched
too
many
episodes
of
highlander
and
decided
he
was
an
immortal
i
'm
not
making
this
up.one
reader
compared
da
vinci
code
to
james
beauseigneur
's
christ
clone
trilogy
and
suggested
that
like
beauseigneur
brown
should
footnote
all
the
factual
material
.
while
beauseigneur
and
brown
have
a
similar
style
and
both
deal
with
controversial
religious
topics
beauseigneur
can
footnote
the
facts
in
his
fiction
because
they
are
facts
.
brown
's
``
facts
''
can
not
be
footnoted
because
they
are
a
fictitious
as
the
rest
of
the
book
.

i
've
never
been
in
paris
.
i
was
n't
a
davinci
's
fan
and
did
n't
know
much
about
his
works
paintings
except
mona
lisa
.
when
i
picked
up
dan
brown
's
da
vinci
code
to
read
i
did
have
a
hard
time
to
follow
the
da
vinci
's
works
and
some
sightseeings
in
paris
described
in
the
book
.
thus
i
had
my
computer
connected
to
internet
besides
me
to
dig
out
different
paintings
and
photos
of
what
the
book
mentioned
like
louvre
pentacle
the
last
supper
opus
dei
headquarters
etc
.
luckily
the
da
vinci
code
special
illustrated
edition
is
just
out.i
could
n't
wait
and
purchased
immediately
regardless
i
have
the
regular
hardcover
edition
of
da
vinci
code
which
i
plan
to
give
it
to
one
of
my
friends
.
this
special
illustrated
edition
is
not
a
cartoon
or
comic
edition
of
dan
brown
's
da
vinci
code
nor
it
is
an
abridged
version
.
it
's
a
full
original
version
embedded
with
over
126
colorful
pictures
photos
besides
the
text
.
it
saves
you
lots
of
time
effort
to
search
from
internet
if
you
do
n't
know
how
chãteau
de
villette
looks
like
the
overview
map
of
the
louvre
and
many
other
scenes
buildings
paintings
mentioned
in
dan
brown
's
da
vinci
code
.
overall
it
's
lovelyundoubtfully
dan
brown
has
done
amazing
jobs
to
his
book
``
the
da
vinci
code
''
.
the
story
is
powerful
and
magnificent
.
mixing
with
a
lot
of
traceable
truth
and
facts
he
made
his
novel
sound
extremely
convincing
and
inevitably
deluded
you
from
what
's
real
and
what
's
fictional
.
however
please
do
n't
take
it
too
serious
it
's
just
a
novel
not
a
research
paper
trying
to
make
a
breakthrough
statement
.
overall
the
book
has
quite
a
lot
of
twists
shocking
you
.
even
the
ending
has
double
meanings.read

i
have
read
most
of
the
reviews
on
this
book
and
i
am
glad
i
did
so
after
reading
the
book
myself
.
i
found
this
book
extremely
interesting
and
entertaining
.
it
is
fun
to
read
a
book
that
gets
the
ole
juices
flowing
in
the
brain
again
.
like
other
reviews
have
said
i
found
myself
putting
down
the
book
and
running
to
the
computer
constantly
to
do
research
.
it
made
me
want
to
learn
more
about
art
christianity
history
etc
.
so
what
if
a
few
of
the
facts
are
not
100
correct
i
looked
up
on
the
computer
what
was
important
to
me
and
am
enjoying
all
the
new
information
and
theories
.
it
will
be
a
fun
topic
of
discussion
and
debate
with
my
friends
who
are
christians
buddists
athiests
agnostic
etc.it
is
a
novel
not
a
faith
deciding
textbook
.
if
you
do
n't
agree
with
facts
go
look
it
up
yourself
and
find
what
you
think
is
true
if
that
bothers
you
then
go
read
in
the
non-fiction
department.do
n't
get
me
wrong
i
am
a
christain
and
am
very
comfortable
in
my
faith
.
i
think
reading
the
bible
cover
to
cover
can
be
more
disturbing
talk
about
contradictions
...
to
all
the
people
who
gave
it
a
one
star
vote
thanks
for
your
reading
suggestions
of

by

hardcover
i
was
introduced
to
the
books
of
author
dan
brown
only
three
weeks
ago
but
have
quickly
absorbed
all
four
of
his
published
works
.
it
is
easy
to
see
why
some
are
comparing
the
work
of
dan
brown
and
james
beauseigneur
the
christ
clone
trilogy
.
both
brown
and
beauseigneur
deal
masterfully
with
the
more
mysterious
features
of
religion
politics
and
science
.
both
bring
to
light
amazing
bits
of
information
which
they
weave
into
the
intricate
patterns
of
their
stories
.
both
are
highly
imaginative
and
write
with
a
ring
of
authenticity
that
makes
for
a
compelling
read
.
while
brown
compresses
labyrinthine
plots
into
brief
time
periods
to
provide
page-turning
suspense
beauseigneur
trilogy
is
of
epic
proportion
covering
several
decades
.
while
brown
applies
the
mysteries
of
history
to
the
drama
of
``
today
''
beauseigneur
uses
both
history
and
prophecy
from
perhaps
a
dozen
major
world
religions
to
transport
the
reader
from
the
world
of
today
to
the
very
dawning
of
a
new
age
in
a
story
reminiscent
of
the
scope
of
asimov
's
classic
foundation.one
other
difference
is
that
beauseigneur
has
taken
the
novel
pun
intended
and
forgiveness
is
asked
approach
of
including
footnotes
in
his
books
of
fiction
.
by
doing
so
he
all
but
eliminates
the
necessity
of
suspending
disbelief
.
few
authors
employ
such
strong
factual
grounding
as
to
make
footnotes
useful
but
i
believe
brown
's
work
and
his
readers
would
benefit
from
beauseigneur
's
innovation
.
