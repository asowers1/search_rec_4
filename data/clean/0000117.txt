relegated

set
out
to
find
a
place
where
they

never

that
the

in

long
and

but
thrilling
epic
are
rabbits
--
beatrix
potter
this
is
n't
.
charismatic
characters
nail-biting
action
and
an
engrossing
plot
combine
to
produce
a
classic
.
when
hazel
's
clairvoyant
brother
fiver
predicts
a
catastrophe
hazel
gathers
other
young
rabbits
willing
to
flee
to
establish
a
new
warren
of
their
own
.
but
few
of
them
have
been
far
from
home
and
their
journey
is
perilous
they
're
attacked
by
rats
in
a
barn
must
cross
a
creek
and
are
lulled
into
a
false
sense
of
security
in
a
warren
whose
rabbits
turn
out
to
be
fed
--
and
harvested
--
by
a
farmer
.
with
every
incident
however
the
value
of
each
individual
becomes
clear
to
the
others
and
they
coalesce
into
a
unified
band
.
when
they
at
last
reach
their
objective
a
desolate
hill
called
watership
down
they
feel
they
have
found
and
earned
a
home
.
but
then
their
search
for
mates
to
help
populate
their
warren
leads
to
an
encounter
with
a
repressive
rabbit
society
and
a
gripping
undercover
plot
that
culminates
in
a
harrowing
stand
against
the
ferocious
dictator
general
woundwort
.
is
it
any
goodquality
watership
down
was
written
for
adults
but
adolescents
often
find
it
more
irresistible
than
their
elders
do
.
although
the
rabbit
characters
have
a
language
and
a
culture
and
they
converse
and
interact
just
as
humans
do
these
are
not
cap-and-waistcoat
picture-book
bunnies
but
fully
realized
characters
whose
conflicts
and
triumphs
keep
readers
engrossed
.
this
is
primarily
an
adventure
novel
but
one
for
thinking
people
.
readers
are
expected
to
engage
their
brains
even
for
the
suspenseful
action
sequences
.
social
allegory
pops
up
regularly
from
the
restlessness
of
the
warren
's
disenfranchised
younger
bucks
to
the
fatalism
and
repression
in
two
other
rabbit
communities
whose
members
have
given
up
freedom
for
an
illusion
of
security
.
author
richard
adams
also
conveys
a
palpable
love
of
nature
.
he
knows
the
story
's
countryside
setting
intimately
and
much
of
his
narrative
contains
descriptions
of
the
landscape
and
references
to
specific
plant
species
