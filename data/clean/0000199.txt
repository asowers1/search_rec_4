the

may
be
a
hammy
portentous
affair
but
nolan
directs
it
with
aplomb
.
he
takes
these
cod-heroic
costumed
elements
and
whisks
them
into
a
tale
of
heavy-metal
fury
full
of
pain
and
toil
surging
uphill
across
the
flyovers
in

of
a

the

the

it
stands

there
will
be
no
spoilers
here
and
if
the
impulse
to
spoil
yourself
before
watching
the
film
is
too
excruciating
to
bear
remember
this
it
'll
be
the
equivalent
of
selina
kyle
robbing
you
blind
.
when
batman
begins
came
out
i
was
very
sceptical
about
watching
another
one
of
those
batman
flicks
such
is
the
enduring
traumatic
impression
joel
schumacher
's
films
left
me
.
thank
goodness
i
did
and
from
that
point
on
there
's
no
turning
back
.
christopher
nolan
's
finale
made
all
the
recently
released
superhero
movies
look
like
child
's
play
to
be
honest
it
is
the
appetizer
to
the
main
course
that
is
the
final
chapter
of
the
dark
knight
trilogy
.
the
typical
critique
of
chris
nolan
's
movies
is
that
it
might
be
too
cerebral
for
the
casual
moviegoer
no
it
's
not
.
his
films
are
universal
it
's
so
well-layered
directed
towards
everyone
.
if
you
're
more
of
the
``
intellectual
genre
''
you
'll
notice
the
political
undertones
and
social
commentaries
and
what
have
you
but
even
if
it
goes
over
your
head
it
does
n't
detract
your
experience
from
the
film
.
fanatic
fans
of
the
batman
comics
will
love
all
the
little
nods
and
references
even
the
major
ones
from
the
comic
books
thoughtfully
implemented
throughout
the
film
.
christian
bale
is
just
magnificent
as
he
puts
it
he
plays
three
characters
the
billionaire
playboy
bruce
wayne
the
true
persona
of
bruce
wayne
still
grieving
the
lost
of
his
parents
and
the
batman
.
he
's
the
defining
actor
of
the
dark
knight
his
portrayal
of
all
these
characters
are
just
perfect
and
even
though
he
's
a
man
dressing
up
at
night
as
a
bat
beating
criminals
to
a
pulp
with
his
bare
hands
we
empathise
with
him
.
returning
inhabitants
of
gotham
and
bruce
's
fundamental
foundation
of
his
lifestyle
is
gary
oldman
's
aged
and
weary
morally-strayed
commissioner
jim
gordon
the
q
to
batman
's
james
bond
lucius
fox
and
possibly
a
best
supporting
actor
nominee
perhaps
the
closest
thing
to
a
father
figure
bruce
can
get
his
moral
compass
oozing
with
words
of
wisdom
michael
caine
's
alfred
pennyworth
.
scenes
between
the
trio
are
so
poignant
beautifully
crafted
and
presented
it
's
so
hard
to
watch
without
getting
a
lump
in
your
throat
to
describe
it
as
tear-jerking
ia
an
understatement
.
one
of
the
newcomers
is
joseph
gordon-levitt
's
solid
portrayal
of
beat
cop
john
blake
and
marion
cotillard
's
enviromentalist
miranda
tate
.
the
chief
antagonist
is
tom
hardy
's
full
time
terrorist
bane
he
's
frightening
to
watch
tom
embodies
and
embraces
the
sheer
brutality
and
monstrosity
of
``
the
mercenary
''
flawlessly
with
half
his
face
covered
up
the
way
he
conveys
his
emotions
with
only
his
eyes
is
amazing
.
anne
hathaway
's
morally
ambiguous
selina
kyle
is
a
wild
card
it
's
really
fun
to
watch
the
development
and
chemistry
between
bruceselina
and
batmanthe
cat
burglar
.
the
2
hours
and
44
minutes
running
time
did
n't
feel
long
at
all
the
story
flows
seamlessly
as
it
comes
full
circle
with
flashbacks
from
batman
begins
and
the
dark
knight
it
's
all
beautifully
balanced
between
the
intimate
moments
of
character
development
that
's
unusual
in
a
summer
blockbuster
film
and
the
really
elaborate
and
simply
put
awesome
all-out
war
action
sequences
and
the
choreography
of
the
brawls
between
batman
and
bane
is
much
improved
than
the
previous
films
.
the
most
important
element
of
the
dark
knight
rises
however
and
what
makes
it
a
gem
is
that
it
manages
to
amp
up
the
suspense
and
anxiety
to
incredible
heights
knowing
that
every
single
character
is
dispensable
including
the
batman
.
when
was
the
last
time
you
watched
a
superhero
film
and
feel
a
genuine
concern
that
our
hero
is
not
going
to
come
out
alive
exactly
.
thank
you
christopher
nolan
for
not
giving
in
to
the
public
and
i
'm
assuming
studio
demands
to
continue
this
magnificent
7-year
journey
we
have
all
been
through
together
to
truly
end
this
great
vision
of
the
legend
with
integrity
to
give
this
great
story
a
great
and
true
conclusion
to
let
the
batman
ride
off
into
the
sunset
if
you
will
.
it
was
the
ending
this
iconic
character
deserved
.
and
to
anyone
who
thinks
the
rises
in
the
dark
knight
rises
is
just
a
convenient
way
to
name
the
film
it
makes
complete
sense

a

cgia
brilliant
ending
to
the
trilogy
.
it
's
so
refreshing
and
so
worth
the
final
result
when
a
director
chooses
to
use
live
action
rather
than
cgi
for
all
well
most
of
the
action
scenes
.
the
pacing
was
a
lot
better
than
the
dark
knight
which
i
felt
sometimes
did
n't
really
build
well
throughout
and
was
unbalanced
between
action
character
scenes
.
though
this
time
the
bulk
of
the
action
is
left
towards
the
end
with
a
great
build
up
of
character
though
the
film
which
really
leaves
you
actually
caring
about
the
characters
at
the
end
unlike
most
cgi
fest
superhero
films
where
you
could
n't
really
care
.
even
though
the
plot
resembles
the
first
film
a
lot
which
i
suppose
it
connected
to
the
``
full-circle
''
talk
of
the
whole
series
the
new
characters
kept
the
film
interesting
.
the
only
downside
for
me
was
bane
.
do
n't
get
me
wrong
tom
did
a
great
job
and
he
was
a
great
character
.
he
just
was
n't
really
as
much
as
a
terrifying
character
than
the
joker
and
we
only
really
had
his
eyes
and
voice
to
go
on
as
far
as
emotion
went
the
latter
was
a
slight
disappointment
as
i
spent
half
the
time
trying
to
work
out
what
he
was
saying
.
but
...
do
n't
worry
there
is
a
great
twist
to
make
up
for
this
-
once
again
gotham
looks
great
as
does
the
cinematography
as
a
whole
.
like
the
characters
the
place
feels
real
and
somewhere
we
should
really
care
about
and
not
just
another
city
to
destroy
in
another
cgi
fest
bonanza
at
the
end
.
i
'm
not
100
sure
if
it
was
the
projector
at
the
cinema
which
i
think
it
may
have
been
but
my
only
gripe
was
some
of
the
scenes
seemed
a
little
too
dark
to
the
point
that
i
could
n't
work
out
what
was
happening
.
overall
a
fantastic
ending
to
a
great
trilogy
.
i
appreciate
films
like
avengers
for
what
they
are
but
for
me
this
approach
to
using
live
action
and
real
characters
just
makes
me
care
about
the
overall
product
a
lot
more
.
