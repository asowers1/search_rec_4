as
the
rolling
stones
frontman
for
the
past
50
yearsâ
mick
jaggerâ
has
had
the
opportunity
to
show
off
many
different
sides
.
there
was
the
skinny
white
bluesman
in
the
first
part
of
the
60s
the
swaggering
devil
of
the
later
part
of
the
decade
the
preening
rock
star
he
portrayed
throughout
most
of
the
70s
the
disco
cat
of
the
late
70s
and
the
rock
n
roll
survivor
hes
played
for
the
past
30
or
so
years
.
hes
rocks
most
famous
frontmansinger
a
role
he
still
cherishes
and
defends
every
time
hes
onstage
.
the
stones
have
always
been
greater
than
the
sum
of
their
parts
but
its
the
individual
components
that
keep
them
moving
.

just
might
be

'time

songs
the
singer
did
n't
have
a
hand
in
writing
'time
is
on
my
side
.
'
none
of
the
stones
did
.
the
band
's
first
top
10
u.s.
hit
was
recorded
by
rb
singer
irma
thomas
earlier
the
same
year
they
were
undoubtedly
influenced
by
her
version
especially
jagger
who
checks
in
with
his
first
truly
great
vocal
nailing
the
soulful
edge
infused
with
a
side
of
gospel
.

'midnight
rambler'
from
'get
yer
ya-ya
's
out
'
1970
the
studio
version
of
'midnight
rambler
'
from
1969
's
'let
it
bleed
'
falls
in
place
with
the
rest
of
the
album
's
bluesy
doom
.
but
the
song
takes
on
an
even
more
menacing
tone
during
the
concert
version
found
on
the
stones
'
best
live
album
'get
yer
ya-ya
's
out
'
the
band
drags
out
the
song
to
almost
10
minutes
on
'ya-ya
's
'
and
jagger
crawls
into
the
cut
's
dirtiest
corners
writhing
his
way
to
some
sort
of
release
by
song
's
end
.
it
's
the
closest
he
ever
got
to
channeling
the
troubled
spirits
of
the
legendary
bluesmen
he
worshiped
.

'let
's
spend
the
night
together'
from
'between
the
buttons
'
1967
the
rolling
stones
were
just
revving
up
to
their
most
creative
period
when
they
recorded
this
single
originally
the
b-side
of
the
no
.
1
'ruby
tuesday
'
in
late
1966
.
the
stones
were
beginning
to
find
their
own
voice
and
jagger
particularly
stopped
copying
american
blues
and
rb
singers
and
started
working
within
the
natural
tone
of
his
vocals
.
'let
's
spend
the
night
together
'
drips
with
sexy
urgency
.

'fool
to
cry'
from
'black
and
blue
'
1976
we
do
n't
have
many
nice
things
to
say
about
'black
and
blue
'
the
lazy
1976
album
the
stones
recorded
between
'it
's
only
rock
'n
'
roll
'
and
'some
girls
.
'
but
this
plaintive
ballad
and
top
10
hit
a
testament
to
the
band
's
strong
but
sagging
chart
prowess
at
the
time
features
one
of
jagger
's
most
emotionally
stirring
and
powering
performances
.
for
years
he
tried
to
ace
the
sweet
simmering
soul
of
american
rb
artists
.
on
'fool
to
cry
'
he
nearly
got
there
.

'tumbling
dice'
from
'exile
on
main
st.
'
1972
the
stones
'
classic
'exile
on
main
st.
'
album
was
famously
made
in
a
drug-fueled
haze
that
brought
the
finished
recordings
down
to
a
sludgy
murky
crawl
.
it
's
absolutely
brilliant
at
times
even
if
the
details
are
hard
to
pick
out
.
we
love
jagger
's
performance
throughout
the
lp
but
he
's
at
his
most
swaggering
on
the
album
's
hit
single
'tumbling
dice
.
'
you
may
not
be
able
to
hear
it
clearly
but
the
band
's
confidence
overflows
here
.

'start
me
up'
from
'tattoo
you
'
1981
as
they
were
heading
into
the
'80s
the
stones
had
very
little
left
to
prove
.
which
is
why
so
many
of
their
records
from
the
past
30
years
are
so
lazy
and
boring
.
but
1981
's
'tattoo
you
'
their
last
truly
great
album
features
some
of
the
band
's
best
songs
.
many
were
pulled
together
from
mid-'70s
sessions
when
jagger
wore
his
rock-star
crown
with
one
eye
on
the
competition
.
he
sings
'start
me
up
'
the
lp
's
best
song
with
defensive
authority
.

1978
after
a
few
years
of

and
personal
missteps

and
dwindling
inspiration

'some

'
was
a
counter
blow
to
both
punk

single
keith
richards
'
stinging
riff
drives
'jumpin

jack

'
but
it
's
jagger
's
strutting
vocal
that
steers
it
.
following
a
brief
trip
into
paisley-colored
pyschedelia
the
band
charged
back
hard
in
1968
sparking
a
creative
burst
that
has
n't
been
matched
by
anyone
since
.
'jumpin

kicks
off
this

'beggars
banquet
'
marks
the
band
's
most
inspired
and
inspiring
era
.
the
album
is
filled
with
some
of
rock
's
most
blazing
moments
--
none
as
dramatic
or
as
menacing
as
the
lp
opener
'sympathy

'
the
music
builds
over
a
sinister
rhythm
and
jimmy
miller
's
production
boils
with
anticipation
.
but
it
's
jagger
who
keeps
it
all
burning
.
he
sings
like
a
man
possessed
