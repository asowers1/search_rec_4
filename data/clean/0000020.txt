the
story
for
readers
who
would
like
a
quick
reminder
of
the
book
and
its
main
storyline
here
is
a
summary
of
the
little
princes
travels
and
those
he
met
along
the
way
.
if
saint-exupãry
is
to
be
believed
the
little
prince
is
a
book
for
children
written
for
grown-ups
.
it
can
be
read
on
many
different
levels
to
provide
pleasure
and
food
for
thought
for
readers
of
all
ages
.
the
author
an
aviator
crashes
with
his
aeroplane
in
the
middle
of
the
sahara
desert
.
while
he
is
trying
to
repair
his
aeroplane
a
little
boy
appears
and
asks
him
to
draw
a
sheep
.
the
author
learns
that
the
little
prince
comes
from
asteroid
b-612
where
he
has
left
behind
three
volcanoes
and
a
rose
.
before
reaching
earth
he
has
visited
other
planets
and
met
some
very
odd
people
a
king
a
conceited
man
a
drunkard
a
lamplighter
a
geographerââ
since
arriving
on
earth
he
has
spoken
to
a
fox
who
has
taught
him
that
to
know
someone
or
something
you
must
tame
them
and
that
makes
them
unique
.
what
is
essential
is
invisible
to
the
eye
says
the
fox
.
in
order
to
return
to
his
planet
and
his
rose
the
little
prince
allows
himself
to
be
bitten
by
a
poisonous
snake
his
planet
is
too
far
away
he
can
not
take
his
shell
.
the
aviator
who
has
succeeded
in
repairing
his
plane
also
quits
the
desert
.
he
still
hopes
the
little
prince
will
return
one
day
and
asks
us
to
write
and
tell
him
if
ever
we
should
meet
his
friend.pour

more
about
the
planets
visited
by
the
little
prince
each
planet
the
little
prince
visits
can
be
seen
as
an
allegory
of
human
nature
.
if
you
have
already
read
the
book
we
invite
you
now
to
take
a
new
look
at
the
different
planets
.
the
king
â
asteroid
b
325
in
the
book
the
little
prince
meets
a
king
who
claims
to
rule
over
all
with
absolute
power
.
his
only
âsubjectâ
however
is
an
old
rat
that
he
hears
at
night
.
the
king
exercises
his
power
over
the
sun
by
ordering
it
to
set
â
but
only
at
sunset
.
in
order
not
to
lose
face
this
oddity
of
a
king
gives
only
âreasonableâ
orders
âi
order
you
to
sit
downâ
â
as
good
a
way
as
any
to
satisfy
his
thirst
for
power
.
the
little
prince
is
not
fooled
however
and
sees
the
monarch
as
no
more
than
another
odd
grown-up
.
the
conceited
man
â
asteroid
b
326
wearing
a
hat
as
showy
as
it
is
ridiculous
the
conceited
man
sees
himself
as
the
handsomest
and
the
most
intelligent
man
on
his
tiny
planet
.
the
little
prince
reminds
the
conceited
man
that
he
is
in
fact
all
alone
on
his
planet
but
still
the
conceited
man
wishes
to
be
admired
and
applauded
.
the
little
prince
is
perplexed
by
such
insistent
vanity
âgrown-ups
are
really
very
oddâ
he
says
to
himself
.
the
drunkard
âasteroid
b
327
he
lives
alone
with
his
collection
of
bottles
and
spends
his
time
drinking
to
forget
that
he
is
ashamed
of
drinking
.
to
the
little
prince
it
is
clear
that
the
drunkard
is
deeply
unhappy
and
he
wants
to
help
.
the
drunkard
however
withdraws
into
sadness
and
silence
.
the
little
prince
is
left
perplexed
by
this
adult
who
sees
no
way
out
of
his
misery
.
the
businessman
â
asteroid
b
328
the
businessman
is
a
large
gentleman
who
is
so
very
busy
that
he
does
not
even
have
time
to
light
his
cigarette
.
he
spends
his
time
counting
stars
which
he
claims
to
own
.
then
he
writes
down
the
numbers
on
a
piece
of
paper
that
he
puts
in
the
bank
.
the
little
prince
tries
to
make
him
see
that
he
is
wasting
his
life
and
that
âowningâ
means
being
useful
to
what
you
own
.
he
speaks
of
his
rose
which
he
waters
and
protects
.
the
businessman
is
left
speechless
and
the
little
prince
once
again
finds
grown-ups
to
be
very
disappointing
.
the
lamplighter
â
asteroid
b
329
the
little
prince
is
initially
rather
charmed
by
this
character
.
his
job
is
a
useful
one
to
light
the
lamp
at
sunset
.
but
the
speed
of
rotation
of
the
lamplighterâs
planet
is
increasing
all
the
time
and
the
poor
lamplighter
is
forever
putting
out
his
lamp
and
immediately
lighting
it
again
.
âorders
are
ordersâ
says
the
lamplighter
to
the
little
prince
who
in
spite
of
everything
can
only
admire
the
effort
this
grown-up
puts
into
being
faithful
to
his
orders
.
the
geographer
â
asteroid
b
330
the
geographer
is
an
old
gentleman
who
writes
down
in
thick
books
the
information
brought
to
him
by
explorers
.
his
planet
is
vast
and
magnificent
but
he
has
no
way
of
knowing
whether
it
has
rivers
and
mountains
because
âthe
geographer
is
far
too
important
to
waste
his
time
browsing
aroundâ
.
â
the
geographer
is
someone
who
needs
the
stories
of
others
in
order
to
know
things
for
the
little
prince
on
the
other
hand
it
takes
effort
to
know
things
.
it
is
the
geographer
who
advises
the
little
prince
to
visit
earth
because
he
says
it
has
âa
good
reputationâ
.
