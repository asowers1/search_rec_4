s.

was
in
the
process

the
stories
into
chronological
sequence
but
died
before
he
could
make
his
intended
changes
to
cause
the
series
to
read
more
smoothly
.
as
they
stand
now
if
read
in
order
of
narnian
chronology
one
notices
some
difficulties
in
tone
.
jadis
a
heroic
amazonian
figure
in
``
the
magician
's
nephew
''
shrinks
into
a
mean-spirited
witch
in
``
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
''
.
the
tone
of
the
various
volumes
varies
considerably
.
as
he
wrote
lewis
became
more
emotionally
involved
with
his
world
and
the
writing
became
more
profound
.
but
a
gain
in
reading
in
chronological
order
is
an
awareness
of
a
cosmology
beginning
with
creation
and
ending
with
an
apocalypse
.
on
the
other
hand
if
read
in
publication
order
one
experiences
something
of
the
delight
and
surprise
that
the
original
readers
of
the
series
had
as
the
narrative
spotlight
illuminated
the
various
narnian
scenes
and
characters
from
book
to
book
.
of
course
it
is
always
possible
to
read
the
series
both
ways
.
perhaps
experience
the
publication
order
first
and
then
sample
the
effects
of
a
chronological
approach
.
in
the
end
it
is
certainly
your
call
.

.
sure
he
helps
the
kids
but
all
that
makes
him
is
a
plot
facilitator
.
he
also
has
his
big
jesus
moment
but
that
has
the
same
problem
as
the
original
if
he
already
knows
that
there
will
be
no
lasting
negative
outcome
how
much
of
a
sacrifice
is
it
reallybut
then
aslan
is
n't
based
on
the
original
fig-cursing
church-rejecting
rebel
jesus
but
the
whitewashed
version
.
like
mickey
mouse
jesus
started
out
as
an
oddball
troublemaker
with
his
fair
share
of
personality
but
becoming
the
smiling
face
of
a
multinational
organization
bent
on
world
domination
takes
a
lot
out
of
a
mascot
whether
your
magic
castle
is
in
california
or
rome.such
a
visible
figure
must
become
universally
appealing
universally
friendly
and
loving
lest
some
subset
of
followers
feel
left
out
.
and
it
's
this
'buddy
christ
'
tradition
from
which
aslan
seems
to
spring
.
devoid
of
insight
wisdom
or
charm
aslan
is
just
here
to
do
things
that
our
protagonists
ca
n't
do.this
also
beggars
the
question
why
did
n't
aslan
just
take
care
of
all
this
stuff
long
before
the
kids
arrived
why
did
all
the
animals
and
fairies
and
giants
have
to
suffer
the
pain
of
an
endless
winter
except
for
a
vague
mention
of
prophecy
there
is
n't
any
reason
for
aslan
to
wait
for
the
kids
since
in
the
end
he
does
it
all
on
his
own
anyways.the
only
thing
the
kids
do
is
help
run
of
the
battle
but
this
is
only
necessary
because
aslan
is
absent
and
he
's
only
absent
because
the
kids
screwed
up
indicating
that
the
entire
thing
would
have
gone
much
more
smoothly
if
they
had
never
been
there
in
the
first
place.in
that
regard
i
have
to
say
lewis
did
an
excellent
job
boiling
down
christianity
into
a
fable
and
leaving
the
problem
of
evil
completely
intact
.
some
readers
suggest
that
aslan
lets
the
queen
take
over
to
teach
the
kids
a
lesson
but
is
it
really
worthwhile
to
let
all
the
inhabitants
of
a
kingdom
suffer
a
century
of
misery
just
to
teach
a
few
kids
about
the
true
meaning
of
friendshipthe
villain
is
just
as
poorly-constructed
and
seems
less
concerned
with
defeating
her
enemies
than
with
being
pointlessly
capricious
.
she
manages
to
trick
one
of
the
children
but
instead
of
taking
advantage
of
this
fact
she
immediately
makes
it
clear
that
she
tricked
him
.
i
mean
how
did
someone
that
incompetent
take
over
in
the
first
placeselectively
stupid
characters
are
silly
and
convenient
especially
as
villains
because
this
completely
undermines
their
role
as
foil
.
it
is
impressive
when
characters
overcome
challenges
but
not
when
challenges
simply
crumble
before
them
.
the
children
are
lucky
the
queen
was
more
of
a
fart-stealing
old
nick
than
a
miltonian
satan
otherwise
they
never
would
have
stood
a
chance.it
is
interesting
to
look
at
how
many
christian
authors
have
tried
to
reconcile
their
faith
with
complex
fairy
mythologies
not
that
christianity
does
n't
have
its
own
magical
fairy
tales
but
these
other
traditions
are
not
exactly
compatible
.
dante
has
virgil
lead
him
through
hell
the
buddha
was
made
into
a
saint
holidays
were
given
new
meanings
even
if
they
often
kept
old
symbols
and
names
and
magical
monsters
were
also
given
a
place
in
the
new
faith.in
the
middle
ages
monks
compiled
'bestiaries
'
which
described
the
roles
of
dragons
unicorns
and
real
animals
in
christian
synbolism
there
were
even
century-spanning
debates
about
whether
dog-headed
men
were
descended
from
adam
.
these
books
were
rarely
accurate
but
allowed
christian
theology
to
adopt
many
stories
and
superstitions
from
earlier
periods
for
instance
the
connection
between
unicorns
and
virginity
or
the
belief
that
pelicans
fed
their
own
blood
to
their
young
in
imitation
of
communion.so
lewis
'
attempt
to
take
myth
and
adapt
it
to
a
christian
cosmology
is
hardly
new
--
there
is
a
long
and
storied
tradition
explored
throughout
the
chivalric
period
and
recognizable
today
in
books
like
the
once
and
future
king
but
lewis
does
n't
a
very
good
job
of
reconciling
these
disparate
mythologies.like
most
protestants
lewis
'
religion
was
a
modern
one
not
magical
and
mystical
but
reasonable
and
utilitarian
.
he
did
not
draw
on
the
elaborate
convoluted
apocrypha
of
hallucinatory
monsters
and
miracles
that
mystics
obsess
over
instead
he
made
a
small
sane
reasonable
magical
world
--
which
rather
defeats
the
point
.
it
is
unfortunate
that
many
of
today
's
readers
think
of
lewis
'
writings
as
defining
english
fairy
tales
since
his
late
additions
to
the
genre
are
not
original
nor
are
they
particularly
well-executed
examples.many
authors
have
come
to
the
genre
with
much
more
imagination
a
deeper
sense
of
wonder
and
a
more
far-reaching
exploration
of
magic
.
we
have
examples
from
kipling
lewis
carroll
dunsany
eddison
morris
and
even
modern
updates
by
gaiman
and
clarke
.
lewis
like
tolkien
may
be
a
well-known
example
but
both
are
rather
short-sighted
and
neither
one
achieves
as
much
as
the
many
talented
authors
who
came
before.i
'm
not
saying
lewis
is
bad
merely
that
he
is
unremarkable
and
is
hardly
preeminent
in
fantasy
or
even
in
children
's
fantasy
.
however
i
do
think
his
fundamental
message
is
a
bad
one
even
if
he
did
n't
realize
he
was
creating
it
.
in
all
of
his
worlds
he
takes
the
sorts
of
people
he
dislikes
defines
them
as
'evil
'
then
sets
himself
apart
from
them
.
there
is
no
attempt
to
comprehend
or
to
come
to
mutual
understanding
.
i
can
not
respect
a
book
which
encourages
people
to
vilify
what
they
do
n't
understand
and
to
call
isolation
righteous
.
if
any
worldview
deserves
the
epithet
of
'evil
'
it
is
the
sort
of
willful
prideful
self-indulgent
ignorance
lewis
displays.my

for
using
too
much
christian
symbolism
but
i
was
in
4th
grade
and
to
me
this
was
the
most
wonderful
and
exciting
book
ever
written
for
children
.
when
mr
goodwin
finished
the
book
.
i
instantly
went
to
the
library
so
i
could
read
it
myself
.
i
was
very
proud
this
was
the
first
book
i
read
``
without
pictures
''
.
to
my
joy
i
discovered
there
were
other
books
about
narnia
and
i
eventually
read
all
of
them
too
.
evenutually
i
discovered
other
wonderful
places
in
other
books
and
i
continue
to
look
for
them
today
.
i
will
always
be
grateful
to
mr
goodwin
he
started
off
by
telling
me
about
narnia
but
in
the
end
he
introduced
me
to
so
much
more
through
my
on
going
love
of
books
.
thank
you
mr
goodwin
for
everything
.

so
i
'm
going
to
roughly
address
them
from
my
perspective
and
hope
it
encourages
some
discussion.1
i
will
agree
that
aslan
is
not
a
strong
christ-figure
.
firstly
for
aslan
to
really
represent
christ
he
would
have
to
be
true
to
the
gospel
story
.
in
other
words
he
would
have
to
be
god
made
into
man
come
to
die
for
all
mankind
.
however
as
he
only
dies
for
the
one
traitor
again
it
's
not
sticking
true
to
the
biblical
gospel
that
all
have
sinned
and
that
christ
was
needed
as
a
sacrifice
for
that
sin
.
if
you
take
things
too
literally
here
c.s
.
lewis
'
novel
does
n't
make
much
that
much
sense
theologically
as
a
result
.
i
'll
explain
where
i
amwas
going
with
that
in
a
moment.2
i
debate
that
c.s
.
lewis
preaches
in
his
novel
.
occasionally
he
can
be
a
touch
patronising
but
compared
to
many
authors
he
rarely
slips
into
such
condescension
.
as
for
his
morality
i
think
you
must
understand
it
from
the
perspective
of
christianity
.
christianity
is
about
black
and
white
morality
essentially
good
versus
evil
light
vs.
dark
and
truth
vs.
lies
etc
.
it
is
also
very
grey
in
that
christianity
is
about
life
and
the
fact
that
no
one
is
perfect
that
everyone
fits
into
that
moral
grey
area
.
of
course
i
explain
roughly
and
inadequately.ultimately
i
see
that
there
is
room
to
argue
that
c.s
.
lewis
does
a
poor
job
of
writing
an
allegorical
novel
.
however
i
see
it
as
a
very
subtle
novel
that
unlike
others
for
instance
the
alchemist
does
not
build
its
story
around
expressing
an
ideology
but
rather
incorporates
an
ideology
into
its
storytelling
.
i
think
that
if
one
wants
to
criticise
this
novel
it
should
be
for
not
properly
showing
the
gospel
rather
than
for
'preaching
'
.
i
know
that
i
and
many
others
enjoyed
the
story
first
before
seeing
the
connection
between
it
and
the
biblical
tales
.
i
enjoyed
it
even
more
afterwards
so
then
again
i
could
be
a
tad
biased.original
reviewto
begin
i
must
note
that
i
grant
this
such
a
high
rating
due
to
the
impact
it
had
on
my
life
.
it
to
me
is
one
novel
that
were
i
to
pick
the
one
novel
that
forged
a
love
of
books
for
me
it
would
be
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
.
why
because
i
can
remember
back
about
twelve
years
ago
when
i
was
homeschooled
by
my
mother
as
a
five
year
old
.
we
wandered
down
during
winter
into
the
warm
back
room
and
she
read
the
first
narnia
book
to
us
.
the
image
of
a
red
faun
carrying
parcels
as
he
passed
a
growing
lamppost
would
stick
with
me
from
that
moment
as
it
stuck
with
c.s
.
lewis
.
as
i
learned
to
read
the
narnia
books
were
the
first
novels
i
sunk
my
growing
reading
teeth
into
.
and
to
this
day
i
have
read
and
re
read
the
novels
back
to
front
and
maybe
front
to
back.the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
is
a
novel
written
for
both
children
and
adults
.
it
contains
highly
allegorical
elements
as
c.s.lewis
was
a
well-known
apologetics
writer
.
however
he
wrote
that
he
did
not
write
his
novel
as
a
pure
allegory
but
as
a
story
.
and
that
is
what
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
is
a
story
to
be
enjoyed
by
everyone
.
and
although
written
in
simple
language
the
reader
can
quickly
concisely
and
easily
imagine
the
world
without
the
clumsy
constraints
of
overused
words
.
i
personally
can
not
imagine
a
world
without
these
novels.additional
thoughts1
.
just
a
question
at
last
.
and
one
with
a
highly
philosophical
twist
to
it
.
why
is
it
that
people
so
readily
condemn
those
books
which
are
considered
as
moral
tales
you
'd
think
we
could
do
with
more
morality
in
such
a
twisted
and
confused
world
regardless
of
accepting
the
belief
systems
.
2
.
i
have
heard
many
people
describe
the
entire
series
as
silly
and
far
too
preachy
.
i
do
not
see
it
that
way
at
all
.
trust
me
if
c.s.lewis
wanted
to
be
preachy
he
would
have
written
a
lot
more
philosophy
and
less
story
.
yes
i
can
see
how
some
would
call
this
silly
but
then
i
argue
that
they
are
missing
the
point
.
it
's
a
fairytale
type
fantasy
intended
mainly
for
children
and
for
those
children
again
as
adults
or
for
their
parents
perhaps
.
but
i
argue
that
as
lewis
only
wrote
this
story
based
on
the
story
of
the
crucifixion
in
many
ways
that
it
was
not
intended
as
a
preachy
book
.
my
question
is
that
why
is
it
that
if
i
were
to
base
a
story
along
what
some
call
the
'christian
myth
'
it
is
claimed
as
preaching
while
as
if
i
were
to
base
it
on
any
other
mythology
or
story
it
would
be
deemed
as
merely
copying
the
themes
of
another
mythology
is
this
yet
another
example
of
doublethinksee
1984
yes
go
and
read
it
-
you
'll
get
what
i
mean

pretty
awesome
in
the
book
.
well
...
sort
of
.
lewis
kind
of
brags
about
aslan
a
bit
...
or
...
a
lot
...
all
the
time
so
the
white
witch
gets
made
fun
of
.
i
know
some
of
you
might
say
well
it
's
a
kids
book
and
for
children
at
the
time
they
were
really
careful
on
what
went
into
the
books
and
how
frightening
or
sad
it
was
.
lewis
does
n't
shut
up
about
it
either
he
mentions
it
a
few
times
.
like
oh
i
would
show
you
this
or
i
would
tell
you
this
but
if
i
did
believe
me
you
wouldnât
be
allowed
to
read
this
book
.
so
...
i
understand
that
he
might
've
felt
the
need
to
portray
aslan
as
very
strong
and
mighty
even
when
he
was
shown
as
weak
and
to
give
the
impression
that
everything
is
going
to
be
okay
â
for
the
children
you
know
but
for
me
and
i
'm
not
a
kid
it
's
...
not
so
fun
and
gets
boring
because
all
the
suspense
is
gone
.
maybe
that
's
why
i
really
liked
the
witch
.
she
brought
with
her
a
kind
of
...
evilness
and
power
and
she
's
a
woman
and
she
's
ruling
.
i
do
n't
care
if
she
's
not
supposed
to
she
's
pretty
awesome
and
she
's
feared
.
in
the
movie
she
seemed
really
really
proud
to
me
and
i
liked
that
.
i
kind
of
imagined
her
like
that
in
the
book
too
but
then
lewis
gives
us
this
``
haa-a-arrh
''
roared
aslan
half
rising
from
his
throne
and
his
great
mouth
opened
wider
and
wider
and
the
roar
grew
louder
and
louder
and
the
witch
after
staring
for
a
moment
with
her
lips
wide
apart
picked
up
her
skirts
and
fairly
ran
for
her
life
.
no
please
.
she
may
not
have
her
wand
but
i
do
n't
think
she
would
'pick
up
her
skirts
and
run
for
her
life
'
â
that
's
just
not
like
her
.
yeah
yeah
it
's
lewis
's
character
and
what
do
i
know
but
seriously
people
authors
always
screw
up
their
characters
without
noticing
.
i
believe
this
is
just
to
show
us
that
the
mighty
aslan
is
feared
by
all
and
if
that
the
witch
is
scared
of
him
yay
everything
will
be
okay
.
i
also
do
n't
like
the
idea
that
she
's
shown
as
'all
bad
'
â
like
she
's
entirely
evil
just
because
she
's
half
jinn
and
half
giant
.
yes
yes
it
's
a
children
's
book
and
the
evil
guy
is
just
evil
and
needs
to
die
â
but
let
's
ignore
that
for
a
few
moments.i
'd
heard
all
about
how
this
book
is
full
of
christian
themes
and
ideas
but
'jinn
'
are
not
christian
are
they
i
do
n't
think
they
are
.
let
me
tell
you
about
jinn.in
islam
there
are
humans
angels
and
jinn
.
the
humans
were
made
of
earthclaymudwhatever
you
prefer
calling
it
the
angels
were
made
of
light
and
the
jinn
were
made
of
fire
.
out
of
the
three
creatures
only
the
angels
are
pure
and
are
created
to
obey
only
.
they
do
not
or
can
not
commit
any
sins
.
so
there
are
no
such
things
as
fallen
angels
.
angels
remain
angels
and
they
are
powerful
creatures
that
serve
god
.
both
humans
and
jinn
however
have
free
will
.
they
can
choose
either
good
are
bad
and
they
have
both
good
and
evil
inside
them
.
satan
the
devil
is
a
jinn
.
he
was
thrown
down
to
earth
because
he
defied
god
and
his
promise
to
him
was
that
by
the
time
the
day
of
judgement
arrives
he
'll
lead
as
many
people
in
to
hell
as
he
can
.
in
a
thousand
and
one
nights
or
arabian
nights
â
whichever
version
you
know
of
jinns
are
portrayed
as
both
good
and
evil
.
the
good
ones
are
called
'faeriesfairies
'
i
think
in
the
english
translation
.
i
do
n't
know
what
the
real
arabic
version
calls
them
but
if
i
ever
get
my
hands
on
it
i
'll
let
you
know
.
anyways
the
bad
jinn
are
called
just
...
jinn
i
think
and
they
are
the
followers
of
iblis
â
which
is
just
the
name
of
the
devil
.
what
i
'm
trying
to
say
is
that
just
like
humans
the
jinn
have
both
good
and
bad
.
they
can
be
evil
and
they
can
be
good
.
so
when
the
beavers
tell
the
children
that
the
white
witch
is
all
bad
and
has
no
good
in
her
because
she
's
half
jinn
and
half
giant
being
the
daughter
of
lilith
my
reaction
was
âexcuse
meâ
there
is
no
lilith
in
islam
and
i
'm
not
very
sure
about
giants
â
though
i
do
think
they
appear
in
a
thousand
and
one
nights
but
they
might
be
some
way
associated
to
jinn
--
but
if
she
's
part
jinn
then
she
has
some
good
in
her
dammit
.
lewis
burrowed
all
sorts
of
things
with
his
giants
and
tree
spirits
and
all
of
that
but
come
on
.
why
would
you
just
take
this
'jinn
'
and
insert
it
into
your
story
just
because
i
know
as
a
writer
he
's
free
to
take
whatever
he
wants
but
that
just
does
n't
make
sense
at
all
if
we
're
looking
at
it
from
how
islam
views
jinn
.
then
there
's
her
name
.
the
white
witch
.
why
is
she
the
white
witch
if
she
is
really
all
bad
why
pick
the
color
white
is
n't
that
'pureness
innocence
clean
'
and
a
whole
bunch
of
other
'good
'
things
in
the
west
i
guess
you
can
say
it
's
because
the
winter
or
the
ice
but
hey
there
are
other
colors
too
.
there
's
blue
there
's
gray
â
or
he
could
just
not
go
with
color
at
all
he
could
call
her
the
ice
witch
the
winter
witch
the
snow
witch
â
i
do
n't
knowwe
talked
about
this
in
class
too
.
like
why
white
so
i
said
well
she
's
half
jinn
.
that
was
when
i
did
n't
know
that
there
were
no
such
things
as
jinn
in
christianity
.
and
they
were
like
is
jinn
white
i
do
n't
really
know
but
if
i
were
to
pick
a
color
for
jinn
it
would
be
white
.
i
even
went
home
and
asked
my
mother
and
she
answered
'white
'
automatically
without
even
thinking
about
it
.
maybe
it
's
because
in
islam
jinn
are
beings
that
live
among
our
world
but
mind
their
business
if
you
mind
your
business
.
maybe
think
of
them
as
spirits
or
ghosts
hate
to
call
them
ghosts
but
just
for
now
.
they
're
invisible
to
you
though
so
white
just
...
makes
sense
.
maybe
it
's
some
influence
of
eastern
culture
on
me
that
i
'm
not
aware
of
...
but
yes
a
lady
jinn
...
white
fits
her
.
so
i
just
can
not
see
her
as
someone
who
is
entirely
bad
or
evil
.
she
's
half
jinn
she
's
given
the
color
white
and
to
me
this
woman
had
some
reason
for
doing
what
she
's
doing
.
i
know
in
the
story
it
's
definitely
no
what
the
fuck
are
you
talking
about
did
you
even
read
but
could
lewis
have
done
a
better
job
with
heruh
yeah
.
come
on
jinn
are
fascinating
.
you
know
what
i
think
i
'll
write
something
about
jinn
someday
.
someday
.
i
swear
i
had
more
to
say
about
her
...
but
moving
on.aslan
.
his
character
is
okay
till
around
the
part
he
gets
sacrificed
.
oh
wait
.
no
that
's
not
it.it
's
when
he
gets
reborn.no
...
that
's
not
it
either
.
oh
yeah
.
it
's
when
he
starts
chasing
the
girls
and
goes
yaaaay
i
'm
a
kitty
come
play
with
me
tickle
me
can
i
hug
you
yaaaaaayyy
â
oh
shit
.
girls
we
've
got
a
war
going
on
and
we
have
some
saving
to
do
.
stop
fooling
around
and
get
on
my
back
we
gon
na
go
rescuing
.
ah
...
hah
...
ha
...
no
seriously
.
does
anyone
understand
what
happened
there
i
think
lewis
was
trying
to
make
aslan
not
seem
like
the
christ
figure
so
he
inserted
that
silly
and
completely
out
of
character
scene
in
there
.
i
mean
he
gets
sacrificed
for
protecting
a
boy
for
the
greater
good
do
n't
you
see
him
as
a
christ
figureit
's
like
lewis
went
oh
crap
.
this
dude
's
a
lion
everyone
's
going
to
talk
about
this
now
and
people
would
hate
me
for
it.or
i
should
ask
is
it
okay
to
compare
animals
to
humans
i
do
n't
really
know
much
about
christianity
so
i
guess
i
ca
n't
talk
much
about
that.but
aslan
buddy
when
you
roared
everyone
ran
the
fuck
away
why
are
you
suddenly
acting
like
a
little
baby
it
might
've
worked
a
little
better
if
we
saw
aslan
acting
more
...
childlike
with
the
arrival
of
the
kids
so
suddenly
coming
back
to
life
and
playing
around
a
bit
would
have
been
there
in
his
character
.
wait
wait
actually
no
.
no
.
even
if
you
say
like
oh
it
's
like
a
whole
rebirth
thing
and
he
's
all
young
and
full
of
energy
now
â
do
you
not
realize
that
there
's
a
war
going
on
they
just
fool
around
for
like
hours
and
suddenly
it
's
all
business.that
makes
no
sense
.
if
lewis
had
shown
him
as
a
more
happyfun
loving
character
with
the
kids
before
it
still
would
've
been
really
really
stupid
of
him
to
waste
hours
just
chasing
around
the
girls
.
and
if
you
say
well
when
he
played
around
he
was
right
on
time
for
everything
else
that
happened
--
still
no
.
it
's
a
book
.
you
can
write
it
a
billion
ways
and
make
it
work
--
but
this
does
not
work
.
no
wonder
they
cut
that
out
in
the
movie
.
it
's
completely
stupid
.
okay
finally
to
susan
.
i
think
i
mentioned
something
about
the
essay
i
had
to
write
when
i
was
reading
this
book
.
so
that
essay
turned
into
a
comparison
between
this
and
alice
's
adventures
in
wonderland
.
it
was
about
culture
war
society
and
...
something
.
i
do
n't
know
.
but
i
talked
a
bit
about
why
this
or
that
was
not
included
so
i
'll
skip
most
of
that
here
.
there
's
one
important
question
left
thoughwhy
was
susan
given
a
freaking
bow
and
arrow
why
was
lucy
given
a
knifewhy
was
susan
who
was
older
than
edmund
not
participating
in
the
war
with
her
freaking
amazing
bow
which
never
misses
why
would
you
give
someone
something
that
they
never
end
up
usingwhy
would
you
send
the
younger
child
to
war
why
not
send
two
of
the
older
ones
and
leave
two
of
the
younger
ones
to
get
a
little
closer
edmund
treated
lucy
like
shit
do
n't
you
think
if
edmund
and
lucy
spent
time
together
during
that
aslan-is-getting-sacrificed
bit
they
'd
get
to
know
each
other
better
more
bonding
time
or
is
it
because
one
's
a
guy
and
the
other
a
girl
they
would
n't
like
to
be
in
each
other
's
companyohthat'snotonequestionsorrywhat
is
the
reason
for
edmund
being
such
an
ass
i
think
the
movie
did
a
better
job
with
this
.
if
i
remember
right
he
was
all
grouchy
and
mean
because
he
missed
his
daddy
--
or
both
his
parents
i
'm
not
sure
but
because
of
the
war
that
makes
a
ton
of
sense.so
why
does
susan
have
such
an
amazing
weapon
if
she
does
not
use
it
she
uses
it
in
the
movie
so
that
was
good
.
but
really
you
have
something
that
will
strike
anything
you
aim
for
and
...
you
do
n't
use
it
it
just
makes
no
sense
.
why
is
that
amazing
weapon
in
this
bookoh
but
this
is
only
one
book
what
do
i
know
about
the
rest
of
the
series
i
asked
and
they
told
me
she
does
n't
do
any
archery
and
she
does
n't
kick
any
ass.and
you
know
that
's
okay
.
it
would
be
fine
if
susan
and
lucy
were
both
shown
as
the
characters
who
were
more
...
caretakers
supporters
helpers
instead
of
fighters
but
...
why
giver
her
the
freaking
bowwhat
's
that
there
for
lucy
is
given
a
dagger
and
told
to
use
it
only
when
she
really
needs
to
.
a
little
kid
given
a
dagger
in
a
time
of
war
told
it
's
dangerous
and
only
to
use
when
she
has
to
.
all
right
i
understand
.
she
does
n't
use
it
and
i
understand
.
she
did
n't
need
to
.
instead
that
potion
...
healing
thing
was
more
important.but
susan
.
she
's
given
a
horn
to
blow
when
she
needs
help
and
she
's
given
an
amazing
freaking
weapon
.
she
uses
the
horn
but
not
that
amazing
weapon.i
feel
sorry
for
that
weapon
.
i
really
do
.
it
's
like
if
i
buy
chocolate
and
i
never
eat
it
.
what
a
waste
.
think
about
it
a
little
though
.
if
susan
had
practiced
a
bit
she
might
've
even
saved
aslan
from
getting
sacrificed
.
maybe
she
could
've
hid
in
the
shadows
and
fired
an
arrow
at
the
white
witch
or
something
.
oh
but
there
was
no
need
you
say
aslan
was
fine
so
are
you
just
going
to
ignore
the
fact
that
one
of
the
characters
has
an
amazing
weapon
just
so
it
does
n't
mess
with
your
plot
and
think
about
how
awesome
she
would
've
been
if
she
did
take
part
in
the
war
just
standing
on
some
hill
firing
arrows
right
and
left
hitting
everything
and
everyone
.
imagine
it
for
a
second
.

is

coming

about
four

accidentally

go
on
to
kill
the
witch
and
themselves
become
the
four
kingsand
queens
of
narnia.though
lacking
much
plot

i
loved
it
simply
because
it
was
so
easy-flowing
i
altually
wished
i
had
a
naughty
kid
near
me
whom
i
could
catch
hold
of

aloud

would

the

the

made
me
scornful

was

'goody

increased

the
bad
ones
.
the
lion
aslan
is
a
wonderful
character
as
well
but
i
have
to
admit
knowing
that
he
was
an
analogy
for
god
changed
my
view
of
the
story
a
bit
and
left
me
a
bit
disappointed
.
he
was
a
bit
cheesy
.
or
maybe
typical
is
a
better
word
.
which
is
why
i
almost
wish
i
wouldnât
have
known
the
true
meaning
of
the
books
until
after
i
read
them
.
in
any
case
the
stories
were
great
the
first
one
being
the
best
.
you
always
lose
a
little
of
the
naivetã
of
the
children
as
they
get
older
but
the
movies
did
them
justice
as
well
.
reading
them
again
as
an
adult
found
me
a
little
bored
but
still
enchanted
overall
with
the
series
.
the
next
movie
is
due
out
soon
and
i
can
only
hope
they
will
continue
to
make
the
movies
which
were
incredible
.
i
highly
recommend
this
series
and
consider
it
a
classic
as
well.note
i
've
recently
started
these
again
with
my
5
yr
old
and
we
are
loving
it
.
i
get
to
see
it
again
through
a
child
's
eyes
.
and
this
time
i
have
n't
told
him
anything
about
the
analogy
to
christianity
however
i
do
point
out
certain
lessons
such
as
forgiveness
.
when
aslan
has
his
talk
with
edmund
i
want
him
to
figure
it
out
on
his
own
.
we
had
a
popcorn
movie
night
and
watched
the
movie
together
curled
up
under
a
blanket
a
few
days
ago
and
as
i
sat
there
i
thought
to
myself
this
is
why
i
had
children
.
to
experience
all
my
favorite
things
over
again
through
a
child
's
eyes
.
it
was
the
best
time

exert
--
especially
the
kinds
of
stories
that
draw
on
the
deep
mythical
archetypes
of
fantasy
to
illuminate
the
real
universe
.
the
chronicles
of
narnia
his
classic
fantasy
series
was
the
fruit
of
that
discovery
set
in
narnia
a
magical
land
whose
world
lies
in
another
universe
in
which
magic
works
and
time
moves
differently
than
it
does
here
and
in
which
christ
is
incarnate
as
the
great
talking
lion
aslan
.
this
first
book
of
the
series
presents
one
of
the
most
powerful
symbolic
literary
presentations
of
the
christian
gospel
ever
written
.
although
the
intended
audience
in
lewis
'
mind
was
children
and
his
author
's
various
direct
addresses
to
the
readers
presuppose
this
there
is
nothing
invidiously
``
juvenile
''
about
the
quality
of
the
writing
it
can
be
enthusiastically
appreciated
by
anyone
who
loves
tales
of
imagination
and
adventure
fantasy
and
wonder
and
the
truths
here
like
those
in
jesus
'
parables
are
simple
enough
to
speak
to
children
but
profound
enough
to
challenge
adults.this
is
the
``
first
''
book
of
the
series
in
the
sense
of
first
to
be
written
and
usually
the
first
to
be
read
.
however
the
magicians
nephew
is
a
prequel
which
describes
the
creation
of
narnia
and
the
origins
of
the
white
witch
and
of
the
wardrobe
that
serves
as
a
gateway
to
narnia
lewis
himself
recommended
that
this
prequel
be
read
first

it

amounted

that

not
the

that
's
absurd

christ

.
--
at

that
's
the
way
i
constructively
interpreted
these
nice
people
four
years
later
when
i
actually
had
come
to
know
quite
a
lot
about
their
religion.they
also
loaned
me
a
copy
of
lewis
'
children
's
book
the
lion
etc
.
first
volume
of
his
narnia
series
presumably
because
i
'd
mentioned
having
read
and
liked
his
perelandra
trilogy
and
autobiography
.
dutifully
i
gave
it
a
try
...
and
hated
it
.
now
as
an
adult
of
sorts
having
also
read
and
despised
his
screwtape
letters
i
could
see
through
the
story
to
the
underlying
propaganda
and
it
bothered
me
a
lot
that
children
were
intended
to
be
exposed
to
it
.
still
they
were
nice
people
.
i
suffered
through
the
thing
out
of
respect
for
them.now
reflecting
on
my
own
early
exposure
to
and
appreciation
of
c.s
.
lewis
i
am
less
prone
to
be
upset
.
i
survived
the
insidious
brainwashing
.
it
appears
my
fourteen
year
old
niece
has
managed
to
do
so
in
recent
years
as
well

i

however

there
is
a
big
'however

i
just

the

feeling

this

do

me
wrong
i
am
a
religious
person

i
believe

with
all
my
heart

but
i
personally
get
a
lot
more
out
of
reading
scriptures
about
him
than
this
allegorical
fantasy
.
so
if
lewis
had
allowed
it
to
be

ya
know
enjoy
the

and
if
you
see
the
parellels

would
have
enjoyed

a

practically
screaming

``

yeah
we
got

read

i
'm
done

it
was
a

stick

to
avoid
a
war
torn
london
and
are
arbitrarily
or
so
it
may
seem
entangled
into
the
affairs
of
another
world
.
however
this
is
n't
just
some
escape
for
the
young
children
.
ironically
in
avoiding
the
conflict
that
afflicts
their
home
they
become
the
key
turning
point
in
another
more
elaborate
struggle.it
progresses
in
a
manner
that
leaves
the
reader
wondering
why
they
even
bother
assisting
in
this
vast
nearly
improbable
endeavour
but
like
any
great
story
it
becomes
so
palpably
apparent
without
resorting
to
brazenfaced
exposition
.
his
ideas
are
presented
mysteriously
oftentimes
are
aspects
of
narnia
hinted
or
implied
even
the
grander
aspects
are
enigmatic
.
they
are
influenced
greatly
by
the
christian
and
other
mythological
allusions
presented
in
the
novel
.
this
struggle
oftentimes
showcases
common
christian
themes
such
as
temptation
faith
betrayal
and
sacrifice
all
of
which
are
basically
touted
but
unequivocally
pertinent
to
the
story
.
they
reveal
both
the
strengths
and
weaknesses
of
the
four
children
their
callowness
and
their
ripening
.
these
themes
grasp
the
cast
of
side
characters
as
well
who
are
as
distinguished
as
they
are
intriguing
.
they
are
not
defined
but
developed
by
these
themes.mr
.
tumnus
perhaps
woven
from
the
story
's
most
infamous
image
typifies
the
challenges
of
these
themes
as
do
both
aslan
and
edmund
.
some
brush
it
off
as
brash
allegory
but
i
see
it
as
a
clever
and
an
even
more
accessible
envisioning
of
topics
which
were
otherwise
bombastic
in
the
hands
of
overzealous
vicars
.
they
were
presented
as
choices
not
duties
and
still
preserved
the
christian
virtue
that
lewis
still
closely
follows
.
so
this
novel
is
n't
merely
a
simple
piece
of
fantasy
.
as
familiar
themes
and
concepts
are
weaved
the
story
becomes
ultimately
original
.
and
though
c.s
.
lewis
is
very
much
a
religiously
devout
man
his
allusions
are
presented
more
passionately
than
piously
.
he
sprouts
truth
through
fantasy
and
at
the
same
time
creates
an
entertaining
story.though
the
oddities
of
this
quasi-fairytale
novel
are
quite
tame
in
comparison
to
eddison
or
carroll
i
think
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
remains
an
effulgent
presence
in
the
genre
.
his
tale
of
heroism
his
contemporary
style
blended
with
a
high
fantasy
splendour
both
succeeded
in
telling
an
entertaining
story
that
did
n't
falter
under
heavy
themes
and
concepts
.
it
was
both
undone
and
unheard
of
at
the
time
of
its
release
.
of
course
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
holds
heavy
influence
on
contemporary
works
today
especially
considering
the
blend
of
earth-dwellers
placed
in
high
fantastical
situations
.
thankfully
the
novel
is
n't
worn
with
age
.
its
immensity
and
broadly-thematic
tale
remain
as
rich
and
accessible
as
any
contemporary
fantasy
work
today
.
it
also
remains
a
model
for
works
of
this
ilk
.
lewis
transcends
the
whims
and
expectations
of
contemporary
fantasy
and
the
banality
of
heroic
fantasy
.
this
more
than
any
other
book
holds
sentimental
value
.
it
was
my
ingress
to
fantasy
even
preceding
the
lord
of
the
rings
and
harry
potter
.
and
the
best
part
is
that
this
novel
is
more
important
to
me
now
than
ever
as
my
keenness
on
fantasy
rises
so
does
my
reverence
for
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
.
the
subtle
aspects
becomes
clearer
as
do
the
themes
and
the
allegory
.
it
is
irrevocably
an
important
piece
of
fantastic
literature
.

wrapped
up
quick.2
.
we
actually
get
to
see
some
real
fight
scenes
and
even
though
there
's
no
blood
and
it
's
all
very
pg
at
least
it
's
not
just
``
there
was
a
battle
going
on
but
then
aslan
showed
up
and
it
was
over
yay
''

.
the
dialogue
is
considerably
less
dated
and
irritating
.
the
kids
in
the
book
speak
like
plummy
old
british
men
watching
a
cricket
match
in
1800
``
'we
've
fallen
on
our
feet
and
no
mistake
'
said
peter
.
'this
is
going
to
be
perfectly
splendid
.
that
old
chap
will
let
us
do
anything
we
like
.
'
''
meanwhile
the
movie
has
lines
like
this
``
when
adam
's
flesh
and
adam
's
bone
sits
at
cair
paravel
in
throne
the
evil
time
will
be
over
and
done
.
''
``
you
know
that
does
n't
really
rhyme
.
''
4
.
aslan
becomes
much
less
of
a
dick
when
he
's
voiced
by
liam
neeson
.
5
.
since
the
book
is
so
short
see
reason
1
there
's
plenty
of
time
for
the
film
to
do
justice
to
everything
in
c.s
.
lewis
's
material
and
even
add
some
things
.
for
instance
did
you
know
the
pevensie
kids
actually
have
a
mother
with
a
face
shocking

as

it
can

to
get
excited
about
books
that
are
``

to
you
or
are
listed
as

reading
.
one
of
the
joys
of
reading
is
picking
out
exactly
what
you
want
whenever
you
want
.
but
with
the
lion
the

and

he
just
could
n't
wait
for
the
next
day
's
chapters
i
love
thatso
now
the
plan
for
us
is
in
no
particular
order
1-find
a
good
recipe
for
turkish
delight.2-watch
the
film
adaptation.3-go
to
ikea
hide
in
a
closet
display
and
jump
out
every
time
someone
walks
by
while
yelling
``
i
'm
back
from
narnia
''
the
chronicles
of
narnia
includes
the
following
installments
update
11232014
so
my
son
and
i
did
actually
find
many
recipes
for
turkish
delight
and
we
ended
up
making
a
batch
.
it
's
very
time
consuming
to
cook
and
it
has
an
odd
texture
but
it
was
worth
the
experience
.
we
each
had
a
piece
while
watching
the
film
adaptation
today
.
definitely
would
n't
put
the
timeeffort
into
making
it
again
though

the
recipe
we
used

book
club
by
will
schwalbe
his
mother
had
a
theoryâwe
are
all
either
narnia
fans
or
middle
earth
fans
.
in
her
experience
people
rarely
loved
both
fantasy
worlds
.
she
and
one
child
were
narnia
people
and
her
son
will
inhabited
middle
earth
in
a
way
that
both
of
them
envied.reading
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
now
as
an
adult
well
into
middle
age
i
find
the
christian
symbolism
in
it
to
be
obvious
and
heavy
handed
.
mind
you
if
you
had
little
exposure
to
christianity
iâm
sure
many
parts
of
the
story
line
would
be
inexplicable
by
contrast
although
many
people
say
they
see
similar
things
in
tolkien
i
seem
to
be
blind
to
it
.
yes
there
is
a
struggle
between
good
and
evil
but
it
doesnât
seem
to
me
to
be
a
particularly
christian
world
or
world
view
and
the
lord
of
the
rings
certainly
doesnât
clobber
you
with
christianity
the
way
than
lewisâ
work
does
.
in
fact
lotr
feels
very
pagan
to
me.i
guess
this
is
my
way
of
saying
if
the
world
really
does
split
itself
evenly
into
team
narnia
and
team
middle
earth
count
me
in
as
a
member
of
team
middle
earth
.
despite
the
fact
that
i
quite
enjoyed
the
fantasy
adventure
the
greek
mythological
beings
fauns
centaurs
dryads
etc
.
plus
the
references
to
northern
european
mythology
the
witch
seems
to
be
to
be
a
relative
of
the
snow
queen
and
father
christmas
has
become
a
regular
everywhere
.
mind
you
it
also
seems
to
me
to
be
a
bit
unfair
to
compare
definite
childrenâs
literature
narnia
with
a
book
that
i
began
enjoying
as
a
tween
and
that
continues
to
comfort
me
now
in
my
5th
decade
lotr.i
certainly
see
why
this
book
has
become
a
classic
and
why
it
still
appeals
to
children
today
.

i
'm
sorry
to
say

.
``
lion
''
is
not
a
bad
book
to
be
sure
but
its
characters
especially
the
humans
are
a
bit
bland
to
stick
with
the
reader
once
the
book
is
closed
.
the
exception
is
edmund
pevensie
who
is
memorable
only
because
lewis
makes
him
so
unrelentingly
obnoxious
for
almost
the
entire
book
.
lewis
also
draws
on
myriad
old
myths
fables
and
legends
to
create
the
hodgepodge
that
is
narnia
creating
little
from
scratch
--
a
criticism
also
leveled
at
j.k.
rowling
decades
later
.
the
plot
of
``
lion
''
is
a
bit
creaky
too
with
some
machinations
making
little
sense
on
their
own
and
needed
solely
to
keep
the
story
moving
forward
.
i
'm
thinking
for
example
of
the
note
left
behind
at
mr.
tumnus
's
house
after
he
is
arrested
--
a
note
that
exists
only
so
that
the
pevensie
children
can
find
out
what
became
of
the
faun.but
some
of
the
touches
in
lewis
's
writing
remain
fresh
almost
60
years
after
the
book
was
written
.
lewis
never
lets
you
forget
he
's
telling
you
a
story
occasionally
interjecting
his
own
opinions
of
the
characters
'
doings
and
more
than
once
reminding
the
reader
of
something
that
happened
in
``
the
last
chapter
.
''
also
now
and
again
he
directly
addresses
the
reader
as
``
you
''
as
would
a
parent
trying
to
draw
a
child
into
a
story.what
else
makes
``
lion
''
intersting
to
the
adult
reader
well
there
is
late
in
the
book
some
hot
girl-on-girl-on-lion
action
.
sure
c.s
.
lewis
mostly
was
writing
a
religious
parable
for
children
but
he
threw
in
some
thinly
veiled
steaminess
for
his
adult
readers
too
.
do
n't

do

is
the
retelling
of
the
passion

the
christ
.
plus
there
's
an
excessive
and
annoying
degree
of
anthropomorphizing
ok
so
the
animals
must
be
able
to
talk
in
order
for
the
story
to
go
forward
but
must
the
beavers
wear
snowboots
and
aslan
the
lion
stand
on
two
feet.the
central
question
for
me
however
is
how
useful
such
an
imaginative
allegory
can
possibly
be
.
i
guess
cs
lewis
can
thumb
his
nose
at
me
for
this
question
though
since
people
are
still
reading
the
chronicles

still
making
movies
not
only
about
aslan

also
human
versions
of

the
number
of
editions
i
have

of
this
book
is
going
to
become
ridiculous
.
it
's
not
that
i
'm
reading
it
in
different
editions
there
's
just
no
way
to
record
multiple
read
dates
...
oh
well.i
used
to
love
this
book
the
most
of
the
whole
series
.
it
's
magical
and
aslan
is
such
a
prominent
part
of
it
and
of
course
it
's
the
book
that
makes
every
child
check
in
their
wardrobe
hopefully
.
actually
i
still
wish
i
could
believe
that
--
one
of
my

has
a
most

deep

that
the

going
to
become
ridiculous
.
it
's
not
that
i
'm
reading
it
in
different
editions
there
's
just
no
way
to
record
multiple
read
dates
...
oh
well.i
used
to
love
this
book
the
most
of
the
whole
series
.
it
's
magical
and
aslan
is
such
a
prominent
part
of
it
and
of
course
it
's
the
book
that
makes
every
child
check
in
their
wardrobe
hopefully
.
actually
i
still
wish
i
could
believe
that
--
one
of
my
housemates
has
a
most
excellent
deep
wardrobe
that
would
be
a
very
good
passage
to
narnia
.
narnia
still
feels
quite
real
to
me
in
this
book
because
the
four
kids
are
so
very
ordinary
to
begin
with
.
it
feels
like
anyone
could
become
a
king
or
queen
in
narnia.anyway
obviously
i
'm
massively
biased
about
this
book
because
it
's
one
of
the
first
books
i
remember
reading
as
a
child
and
i
adored
it
then
.
i
always
used
to
read
it
when
i
was
sick
--
or
if
i
was
too
sick
to
sit
up
i
'd
watch
the
animated
movie
from
my
vantage-point
of
being
draped
over
the
sofa.my
mother
always
says
that
it
was
something
of
a
toss-up
whether
tolkien
and
c.s
.
lewis
created
middle-earth
and
narnia
or
whether
it
could
've
happened
the
other
way
round
.
she
also
adds
that
she
likes
both
but
would
prefer
tolkien
's
whichever
one
that
happened
to
be
.
i
do
n't
know
about
that
knowing
about
their
religious
and
philosophical
beliefs
and
how
they
differed
but
i
can
very
much
see
their
influence
on
each
other
.

but
the
tear-drenched
scene
with
susan
and
lucy
keeping
guard
over
aslan
's
dead
body
was
effective
as
was
the
resurrection
.
and
it
felt
good
to
see
how
surprised
the
witch
was
when
he
unexpectedly
turned
up
at
the
battle
.
so
maybe
it
was
n't
such
a
bad
idea
after
all
.
the
book
certainly
had
many
strong
points
.
finding
a
magic
doorway
in
a
wardrobe
was
cool
as
was
the
idea
that
time
would
pass
at
different
rates
in
different
worlds
.
i
loved
the
preposterous
tea-party
at
mr.
tumnus
's
house
.
even
at
age
9
i
could
see
that
the
sardines
and
cake
needed
a
lot
of
explanation
but
it
was
funny
.
i
had
similar
feelings
about
mrs.
beaver
's
sewing
machine
and
father
christmas
and
his
sack
of
presents
.
come
on
.
how
is
hiding
their
breakfast
tray
in
there
the
white
witch
was
a
satisfactory
baddie
as
was
maugrim
.
and
the
turkish
delight
.
everyone
enjoys
the
bit
with
the
turkish
delight
.
my
own
kids
were
fascinated
by
it
when
they
were
small
and
disappointed
when
they
tried
real
turkish
delight
and
found
it
was
nothing
special.i
still
sort
of
like
the
book
even
though
i
now
feel
a
bit
annoyed
that
he
is
trying
to
manipulate
me
.
but
enough
of
the
time
he
's
forgetting
to
preach
and
just
having
fun
letting
the
story
go
where
it
wants
to
go
so
i
forgive
him
.
maybe
he
did
teach
me
some
christian
virtues
after
all

it
came

my

still
it
had
taken
a
number
of
years
before
i
had
actually
read
it
along

the
whole

.
do
i
lament
the
fact
that
this
was
not
a
part
of
and
came
into
my
life
way
past
my
childhood
or
even
when
iâm
too
old
but
not
actually
to
be

a
teen
i
believe
a
book
chooses
the
reader
when
one
is
ready
to
receive
it
and
it
comes
in
such
a
propitious
time
of
oneâs
life.taken
as
it
is
one
can
easily
enjoy
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
from
here
on
out
referred
to
as
lww
for
convenienceâs
sake
as
a
simple
adventure
and
fairy
tale
of
brothers
and
sisters
peter
susan
edmund
and
lucy
pevensie
who
one
day
discovers
a
wardrobe
that
acts
as
a
bridge
into
a
mystical
land
called
narnia
.
lewis
populates
this
enchanted
landscape
with
talking
animals
and
creatures
inspired
from
legend
and
mythology
like
fauns
minotaurs
dwarfs
centaurs
giants
and
father
christmas
to
name
just
a
few
that
adds
to
the
delight
of
young
and
adult
readers
.
at
the
heart
of
the
bookâs
plot
is
a
quest
that
concerns
the
penvensies
a
prophecy
they
must
fulfill
to
right
wrongs
along
with
the
coming
of
aslan
king
of
kings
to
bring
an
end
to
the
hundred-year
reign
of
the
white
witch
and
her
evil
spell
that
placed
narnia
in
a
never-ending
winter.those
above
along
with
magic
treachery
sacrifice
and
the
battle
pitting
aslanâs
army
against
the
white
witchâs
hordes
are
some
of
the
elements
of
the
story
i
strongly
responded
to
when
i
saw
the
film
and
still
are
when
i
subsequently
read
the
book
.
yet
other
than
conjuring
a
fantastic
yarn
for
the
enjoyment
of
the
readers
there
is
more
than
that
meets
the
eye
in
lww.what
i
think
draw
the
initiates
and
enthusiasts
alike
to
lewisâs
masterpiece
repeatedly
is
that
llw
is
more
than
its
story
as
one
intending
to
dig
deep
within
its
plot
can
discover
for
themselves
a
treasure
trove
of
lessons
.
indeed
it
incorporates
christian
allusions
and
symbols
that
at
first
glance
is
already
obviousâmuch
to
the
chagrin
of
its
adult
readersâyet
the
author
handles
it
with
grace
and
he
isnât
heavy
handed
with
the
message
of
his
book
for
we
are
already
disarmed
by
the
charming
voice
of
the
narrator
.
as
smooth
as
snow
the
story
draws
us
in
so
much
so
that
the
fluidity
of
lewisâs
underlying
narrative
manages
to
communicate
in
us
gems
of
lessons
in
faith
reason
as
well
as
moral
truth
with
us
being
not
quite
aware
of
it
at
first.as
humans
there
is
built
in
us
a
trait
whether
we
be
aware
of
it
or
not
a
deep-seated
natural
ability
to
determine
truth
on
a
subconscious
and
emotional
level
and
be
attracted
to
it
.
this
i
believe
is
what
c.
s.
lewis
taps
into
thatâs
why
for
generations
now
readers
of
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
and
all
of
the
books
in
the
chronicles
of
narnia
are
easily
drawn
it
that
with
lewisâs
pen
we
are
not
only
touched
by
the
aesthetics
of
a
tale
well
told
it
is
to
experience
too
the
hand
of
the
divine._________________________book

loud
.
he
successfully
manages
to
blend
humor
adventure
mystery
and
excitement
all
the
while
paralleling
the
most
important
event
in
all
of
mankind
.
interestingly
enough
the
entire
parallel
of
the
atonement
and
the
resurrection
lasts
only
2
chapters
.
my
favorite
part
of
the
book
is
when
lucy
and
susan
follow
aslan
and
then
help
him
in
his
slow
march
to
the
stone
table
.
the
emotion
in
the
story
and
the
significance
of
the
parallel
at
this
point
in
the
story
is
magnificent
.
without
rambling
on
and
on
this
book
is
everything
a
classic
should
be
.
a
must
read
for
all
fans
of
fantasy
and
who
consider
themselves
religious
.

i
hope
no
one
who
reads
this
book
has
been
quite
as
miserable
as
susan
and
lucy
were
that
night
but
if
you
have
been
-
if
you
've
been
up
all
night
and
cried
till
you
have
no
more
tears
left
in
you
-
you
will
know
that
there
comes
in
the
end
a
sort
of
quietness
.
you
feel
as
if
nothing
is
ever
going
to
happen
again

i
wrote
this
story
for
you
but
when
i
began
it
i
had
not
realized
that
girls
grow
quicker
than
books
.
as
a
result
you
are
already
too
old
for
fairy
tales
and
by
the
time
it
is
printed
and
bound
you
will
be
older
still
.
but
some
day
you
will
be
old
enough
to
start
reading
fairy
tales
again
.
you
can
then
take
it
down
from
some
upper
shelf
dust
it
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
it
.
i
shall
probably
be
too
deaf
to
hear
and
too
old
to
understand
a
word
you
say
but
i
shall
still
be
your
affectionate
godfather
