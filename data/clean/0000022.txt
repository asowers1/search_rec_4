hardcover
this
is
not
a
review
of
tolkien
's
``
the
lord
of
the
rings
''
.
its
having
been
voted
``
the
greatest
book
of
the
millenium
''
here
on
amazon.com
says
more
than
enough
about
the
worth
of
tolkien
's
work
.
rather
it
is
a
review
of
the
several
hardcover
editions
of
this
fantastic
story.there
are
for
major
hardcover
editions
of
lotr
all
published
by
houghton
mifflin
co
.
they
are
essentially
the
same
price
so
i
will
not
take
that
into
consideration.the
best
of
the
editions
5
stars
is
the
blue
alan
lee
illustrated
version
printed
in
nov
1991
.
i
have
owned
this
book
for
several
years
and
read
it
three
times
.
it
is
durable
beautiful
and
has
no
flaws
that
i
have
found
.
the
illustrations
are
wonderful
though
most
tolkien
fans
will
have
seen
these
pictures
before.the
red
edition
printed
in
nov
1974
is
also
a
solid
edition
of
the
book
4
stars
.
it
is
every
bit
as
good
as
the
blue
version
but
does
not
have
the
illustrations
.
if
you
are
the
type
of
reader
that
prefers
to
leave
everything
to
your
imagination
this
is
the
version
for
you.both
the
blue
and
red
versions
have
matching
editions
of
``
the
hobbit
''
houghton
mifflin
sep
1997
or
oct
1973
respectively
.
i
found
both
of
these
editions
to
be
satisfactory.the
other
two
major
editions
of
lotr
-
the
white
three-volume
edition
from
oct
1988
and
the
black
seven-volume
edition
from
jan
2000
-
are
not
recommended
2
stars
.
the
print
quality
in
both
is
poor
and
the
durability
is
less
than
that
of
the
red
and
blue
versions
.
the
only
advantage
of
these
editions
is
portability
as
the
red
and
blue
versions
are
single-volume
and
quite
hefty.ramble

hardcover
while
the
price
of
this
book
is
steep
this
is
easily
the
best
version
of
this
book
in
print
.
the
gilded
pages
and
high-quality
leather
look
smell
and
feel
wonderful
.
this
is
not
the
questionable
quality
leather
used
on
previous
versions
this
is
the
real
deal
.
more
importantly
this
version
has
as
j.r.r
.
recorded
in
letters
reproductions
of
the
book
of
marzubul
.
these
are
the
pages
from
the
dwarven
book
found
in
the
mines
of
moria
by
gandalf
and
the
fellowship
.
in
the
begining
and
ending
of
the
book
are
also
included
maps
that
fold
out
to
render
middle-earth
for
the
reader
again
as
the
author
originally
wanted.this
is
the
book
that
tolkien
dreamed
of
having
published
but
could
n't
due
to
the
realities
of
post-wwii
publishing
costs
and
questions
about
a
400000
word
publication.for
me
there
is
an
emtoional
response
to
this
book
for
two
reasons
.
one
it
is
as
fine
or
better
than
the
book
the
author
originally
wished
to
have
published
and
two
it
is
a
beautiful
piece
of
art
all
on
its
own
suitable
for
display
.
if
you
love
books
or
love
tolkien
or
both
this
is
a
must
have
and
the
centerpiece
of
any
worthy
collection.some
are
commenting
that
the
book
is
n't
actually
leather
.
be
sure
to
check
your
version
as
there
are
others
available
but
the
information
provided
to
me
stated
my
copy
was
leather
and
if
it
is
fake
it
fooled
me
.

mass
market

everyone
knows
the
hobbit
and
the
lord
of
the
rings
are
wonderful
stories
and
i
fully
agree
.
the
reason
for
my
bad
rating
of
this
particular
edition
of
jrr
tolkien
's
works
is
that
the
books
are
riddled
with
typographical
errors
some
so
severe
that
they
change
the
meaning
of
sentences
effectively
reversing
the
author
's
intent
.
one
example
``
the
breelanders
locked
their
doors
at
night
which
was
also
not
unusual
in
the
shire
.
''
the
word
``
unusual
''
should
have
been
``
usual
''
--
i.e
.
the
shire
hobbits
do
n't
usually
lock
their
doors
at
night
.
but
exactly
the
opposite
idea
is
conveyed
by
this
typographical
error
and
there
are
many
more
errors
where
that
one
came
from
.
i
counted
three
errors
on
one
page
avoid
this
edition
at
all
costs

as
someone
else
mentioned
we
all
know
the
lord
of
the
rings
to
be
by
the
far
one
of
the
greatest
works
of
writing
of
the
20th
century
.
it
is
all
a
game
we
play
with
tolkien
for
he
too
took
it
much
more
seriously
then
any
other
fantasy
of
science
fiction
writer
ever
has
.
he
made
up
languages
that
existed
in
relationship
to
languages
and
dialects
that
we
have
in
english
and
thus
created
a
nightmare
for
translators
.
he
told
stories
of
all
sorts
of
perils
of
creation
and
made
sure
everything
was
done
right
.
thus
when
an
edition
like
this
comes
out
it
is
truly
painful
.
for
one
originally
tolkien
created
some
of
the
most
beautiful
maps
of
middle
earth
spending
time
making
sure
that
all
of
the
proportions
were
accurate
.
he
did
n't
just
jumble
down
some
lines
for
the
coast
line
for
example
.
he
spent
many
hours
making
sure
everything
was
proportinate
and
made
sense
.
however
sometime
after
1988
ballantine
started
to
release
editions
of
the
triliogy
with
completely
new
maps
all
signed
by
some
shelly
shapiro
.
in
either
case
these
new
maps
were
plauged
with
problems
from
being
too
cartoony
and
unproportinate
to
having
names
of
locations
from
the
original
maps
done
away
with
.
the
maps
from
the
very
beginning
have
been
essential
to
the
lotr
books
and
having
cheap
maps
made
is
annoying
beyond
belief
.
it
shows
a
sign
of
disrespect
from
the
editors
.
to
me
it
says
``
people
wo
n't
notice
anyway
.
lets
make
a
smaller
sized
book
with
less
detailed
maps
and
save
some
money
.
''
if
you
truly
want
to
expierience
this
epic
or
history
more
accurately
as
tolkien
envisioned
it
not
some
editor
at
ballantine
spend
some
extra
cash
and
either
get
a
different
edition
or
buy
a
good
map
there
is
currently
an
excellent
one
made
by
christopher
tolkien
which
is
much
larger
and
detailed
.
of
course
were
the
map
adequate
this
edition
still
suffers
from
annoying
miscopies
and
misprints
and
so
on
.
do
n't
sell
out
for
cheap
editions
.
you
've
been
warned
.
