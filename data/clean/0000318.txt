's
surprisingly
easy
to
forget
about

with
arena
rock
gradually
fading
from
relevance
or
at
least
being
subverted
and
co-opted
as
a
genre
and
idea
â
the
closest
thing
to
a
stadium-geared
blockbuster
in
the
last
year
might
have
been
one
direction's
midnight
memories
â
zeppelin
's
enduring
influence
as
the
ideal
of
big
rock
music
is
less
relevant
than
ever
.
even
almost
famous
the
zep-soaked
cameron
crowe
flick
that
helped
expose
a
new
generation
to
the
classic
rock
of
their
parents

almost
15
years
old
at
this
point

the
next

you
hear

it
might
actually
sound
interesting
and
refreshing
â
which
is
kinda
cool

just
feels
intuitively
wrong.it
takes
an

remind
you
of
how
incredible
this

really
was
.
some
elements
of
the
zeppelin
experience
have
n't
dated
quite
so
brilliantly
â
namely
the
rampant
misogyny
the
even
more
rampant
tolkien
references
and
the
always-terrible

â
but
the
songs
the
sound
and
the
sheer
size
of
the
group
continue
to
dazzle
to
this
day
.
if
they
make
music
on
this
scale
in
2014
it
's
certainly
not
to
be
found
in
the
rock
genre
and
you
'd
be
pretty
hard-pressed
to
find
it
anywhere
else
either.as

1979a
large
portion
of
the
zep-listening
population
would
likely
bristle
at
the
inclusion
of
the
band
's
final
top
40
hit
in
their
all-time
top
five
and
it
's
not
hard
to
see
why

conceptually
the
song
sounds
disastrous
a
pop
song
closer
that
's
just
as
much
``
bennie

the
jets
''
as
``

drops
out
with
a
hissing
disco
whistle
for
an
extended
samba
breakdown
luckily
led
zeppelin
were
really
good
goddamn
songwriters
and
``
fool
''
is
as
tight
and
catchy
and
clever
as
any
other
late-'70s
crossover
with

of

monolithic
song
in

a
song
that
's

by

the
biggest
song
on
their
biggest
album
in
the
biggest
stretch
of
their
career
``
kashmir
''
was
obviously
led
zeppelin
's
ultimate
too-big-to-fail
moment
a
plodding
eight-and-a-half
minute
journey
through
a
faraway
land
that
zeppelin
themselves
had
never
even
been
to
a
song
which
was
either
going
to
define
them
as
pretentious
fops
whose
reach
far
exceeded
their
grasp
or
simply
the
greatest
hard-rock
band
in
the
history
of
recorded
music.naturally
it
did
the
latter
as
the
song
stands
as
their
most
singular
hypnotic
and
awesome-in-the-truest-sense
epic
of
the
band
's
career
â
though
they
'd
have
their
moments
in
the
former
category
soon
enough

of

his
instincts
were
right
the

the
sound

zeppelin
's
greatest
quality
apart
from
the
weird
time
signatures

instrumentation
and

there
was
a
secret
world
of
higher
musical
understanding
that
only
they
as
the
ultimate
rock
gods
had
access
to

which
they
could
transport
you

wondrous
