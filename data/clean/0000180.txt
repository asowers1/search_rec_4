in

george
lucas
released
star
wars
the
ultimate
sci-fi
popcorn
flick-turned-pop-culture
myth
machine
.
it
quickly
became
the
biggest
money-making
film
of
all
time
and
changed
the
shape
of
the
film
industry
.
after
two
successful
sequels
1980
's
the
empire
strikes
back
and
1983
's
return
of
the
jedi
that
extended
the
story
of
the
first
film
lucas
took
some
time
off
to
produce
movies
for
others
with
mixed
success
.
in
1999
lucas
returned
to
the
star
wars
saga
with
a
new
approach
--
instead
of
picking
up
where
return
of
the
jedi
left
off
star
wars
episode
i
--
the
phantom
menace
would
be
the
first
of
a
trilogy
of
stories
to
trace
what
happened
in
the
intergalactic
saga
before
the
first
film
began
.
here
obi-wan
kenobi
ewan
mcgregor
is
a
young
apprentice
jedi
knight
under
the
tutelage
of
qui-gon
jinn
liam
neeson
anakin
skywalker
jake
lloyd
who
will
later
father
luke
skywalker
and
become
known
as
darth
vader
is
just
a
nine-year-old
boy
.
when
the
trade
federation
cuts
off
all
routes
to
the
planet
naboo
qui-gon
and
obi-wan
are
assigned
to
settle
the
matter
but
when
they
arrive
on
naboo
they
are
brought
to
amidala
natalie
portman
the
naboo
queen
by
a
friendly
but
opportunistic
gungan
named
jar
jar
.
qui-gon
and
obi-wan
plan
to
escort
amidala
to
a
meeting
of
republic
leaders
in
coruscant
but
trouble
with
their
spacecraft
strands
them
on
the
planet
tatooine
where
qui-gon
meets
anakin
the
slave
of
a
scrap
dealer
.
qui-gon
is
soon
convinced
that
the
boy
could
be
the
leader
the
jedis
have
been
searching
for
and
he
begins
bargaining
for
his
freedom
and
teaching
the
boy
the
lessons
of
the
force
.
the
supporting
cast
includes
pernilla
august
as
anakin
's
mother
terence
stamp
as
chancellor
valorum
and
samuel
l.
jackson
as
jedi
master
mace
windu
.
jackson
told
a
reporter
before
the
phantom
menace
's
release
that
the
best
part
about
doing
the
film
was
that
he
got
to
say
``
may
the
force
be
with
you
''
onscreen

wanted
from

of

i
'm
in
the
minority
on
the
new
trilogy
but
i
enjoy
them
greatly
.
they
never
quite
reach
the
heights
of
the
one-two
punch
of
a
new
hope
and
the
empire
strikes
back
but
they
are
on
par
and
sometimes
better
than
return
of
the
jedi
.
the
phantom
menace
has
a
few
problems
but
it
is
great
entertainment
.
the
special
effects
finally
are
up
to
the
standards
george
lucas
envisioned
for
his
stories
and
they
look
light
years
ahead
of
the
original
trilogy
.
they
still
hold
up
well
today
.
the
added
characters
to
the
mythology
are
great
and
the
actorsactresses
portraying
them
are
even
better
than
the
originals
which
was
not
a
master
class
in
acting
but
they
did
their
job
well
enough
.
i
especially
love
darth
maul
who
gives
the
sith
another
great
villain
in
the
series
.
obviously
a
big
deal
is
made
about
how
annoying
jar
jar
binks
is
and
while
i
wo
n't
say
he
is
n't
annoying
because
he
certainly
is
i
do
think
that
entire
thing
is
overblown
way
out
of
proportion
.
he
does
n't
destroy
the
film
by
any
means
.
the
story
meanders
for
awhile
and
is
probably
the
weakest
of
them
all
but
there
's
still
plenty
of
incredible
action
and
set
pieces
to
hold
on
to
.
the
finale
with
darth
maul
is
just
as
rousing
as
anything
in
the
series
and
the
music
is
superb
.
the
phantom
menace
continues
the
star
wars
legacy
with
aplomb
and
it
only
gets
better
from
here
