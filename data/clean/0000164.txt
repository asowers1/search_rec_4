during

stages
of
the

pixar
revisited
their

found
that
although
they
could
open
the
old
computer
files
for
the
animated
3d
models
error
messages
prevented
them
from
editing
the

this
necessitated
recreating
the

from

to
create
the
chaotic
and
complex
junkyard
scene
near
the
film
's
end
more
than
a
year
and
a
half
was
invested
on
research
and
development
to
create
the

unkrich
initially
stated
that
a

was
not
being
planned
.
``
well
we
do
n't
have
any
plans
for

''
unkrich
said
.
``
i
'm
flattered
that
people
ask
about
itâit
reminds
me
how
much
people
love
the
characters
but
it
was
really
important
to
me
with
this
film
that
we
not
just
create
another
sequel
that
it
not
just
be
another
appendage
coming
off
of
the
other
two
.
''
unkrich
went
on
to
say
``
there
may
be
opportunities
for
woody
and
buzz
in
the
future
but
we
do
n't
have
any
plans
for
anything
right
now
.
``

it
has
also
been
reported
that
hanks
and
allen
have
signed
on
for
fourth
toy
story
film
if
pixar
ever
decides
to
produce
one.164
in
a
bbc
interview
in
2011
hanks
said
that
he
thought
pixar
was
working
on
a
sequel.165
disney
denied
the
rumors
saying
``
nothing
is
official
.
``
166
in
november
2014
bob
iger
confirmed
that
a
fourth
toy
story
film
would
be
released
in
2017
with
john
lasseter
directing
.
lasseter
stated
``

ended

story
with
andy
so
perfectly
that
for
a
long
time
we
never
even
talked
about
doing
another

movie
.
but
when
andrew
pete
lee
and
i
came
up
with
this
new
idea
i
just
could
not
stop
thinking
about
it
.
it
was
so
exciting
to
me
i
knew
we
had
to
make
this
movieâand
i
wanted
to
direct
