is
a
grown-up
read
about
a
bunny
adventure

richard
adams
'
classic
novel
watership
down
is
n't
just
about
rabbits
.
tackling
the
big
ideas
including
the
importance
of
storytelling
to
society
adams
weaves
an
adult
tale
of
human
struggle
cloaked
as
a
book
about
bunnies
.
when
i
was
at
college
a
fellow
student
told
me
that
i
had
to
read
watership
down
.
when
i
asked
what
the
book
was
about
i
remember
him
telling
me
ârabbits
on
the
move
trying
to
find
a
new
home.â
rabbits
my
eyes
started
to
glaze
over
.
he
started
to
summarize
the
story
but
all
i
recall
was
that
the
main
rabbit
was
named
hazel
and
that
there
were
some
other
rabbits
named
bigwig
dandelion
fiver
and
pipkin
.
the
glazing
process
was
complete
â
the
rest
of
the
pitch
came
across
as
blah
blah
blah
blah
.
this
year
as
i
had
decided
to
read
and
write
about
books
involving
travel
ârabbits
on
the
moveâ
came
immediately
to
mind
and
i
added
it
to
my
to-read
list
for
kc
unbound
.
and
i
must
say
that
this
book
has
probably
been
the
biggest
pleasant
surprise
iâve
had
in
reading
in
the
past
decade
.
the
book
turned
out
to
be
so
much
more
than
âbunnies
on
a
tripâ
or
even
âbunnies
on
an
exodus
of
survival.â
if
i
had
to
categorize
the
book
iâd
probably
group
it
with
epics
of
travel
.
some
reviewers
compared
it
to
homerâs
odyssey
but
i
think
virgilâs
aeneid
would
be
a
more
apt
comparison
because
of
the
emphasis
on
personal
responsibility
to
the
group
.
richard
adams
says
that
the
story
began
as
a
series
of
stories
he
told
his
little
girls
as
they
traveled
on
long
drives
in
the
english
countryside
.
that
may
be
though
these
stories
at
least
as
presented
in
the
completed
novel
are
not
for
kids
.
and
parents
who
may
be
thinking
of
checking
out
the
animated
film
of
watership
down
for
your
kids
â
watch
it
first
yourself
.
the
film
should
have
gotten
a
pg-13
rating
what
would
have
been
a
gp
at
the
time
of
release
instead
of
g
in
my
opinion
â
thereâs
a
fair
amount
of
violent
action
and
the
mood
of
most
of
the
narrative
is
rather
unsettling
.
with
rabbits
on
the
cover
watership
might
seem
to
be
a
childrenâs
book
but
its
themes
and
presentation
are
much
too
complex
for
that
.
this
is
a
book
that
has
a
lot
that
would
traumatize
a
youngster
especially
if
she
were
expecting
something
more
along
the
line
of
max
and
ruby
.
older
audiences
can
handle
the
tough
subject
matter
loss
terror
and
death
and
appreciate
what
is
mainly
a
tale
about
the
importance
of
community
the
importance
of
story
in
fostering
community
and
the
value
of
a
brave
heart
in
a
dangerous
world
.
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
the
book
is
that
certain
words
are
given
in
lapine
the
language
adams
imagines
for
the
rabbits
.
this
is
somewhat
similar
to
what
anthony
burgess
did
in
a
clockwork
orange
where
the
narrator
alex
de
farge
uses
the
teen
slang
of
his
day
nadsat
to
tell
his
story
.
the
difference
is
that
where
alexâ
whole
narration
is
done
in
this
slavic-rich
slang
adams
uses
only
a
relatively
few
lapine
words
sprinkled
through
the
text
.
my
favorite
of
these
is
hrududu
the
rabbitsâ
word
for
any
motorized
conveyance
because
of
the
sound
.
i
can
imagine
adamsâ
daughters
giggling
every
time
he
has
a
rabbit
refer
to
a
hrududu
.
adams
also
suggests
that
other
animals
mice
and
birds
are
singled
out
have
their
own
languages
distinct
from
lapine
though
the
animals
can
communicate
with
one
another
using
some
kind
of
pigeon
or
creole
â
strangely
enough
adams
gives
the
mice
a
french
accent
but
gives
kehaar
the
gull
who
gets
the
closest
to
the
rabbits
a
scandinavian
accent
.
of
course
animals
donât
âspeakâ
with
one
another
in
a
way
that
humans
do
â
there
is
no
evidence
that
animals
have
a
real
sense
of
âpastâ
or
that
they
narrate
stories
whereas
human
knowledge
of
the
world
is
very
much
affected
by
our
being
the
animals
who
tell
and
listen
to
stories
.
other
than
the
use
of
language
adams
chose
not
to
change
the
behavior
of
the
rabbits
â
in
other
words
his
rabbits
do
not
act
like
the
animals
in
aesopâs
fables
or
like
cartoon
animals
like
humans
in
animal
form
â
consider
the
bipedal
bugs
bunny
.
adams
based
his
rabbitsâ
behavior
on
that
of
real
rabbits
from
his
own
observation
and
from
reading
books
such
as
r.m
.
lockleyâs
the
private
life
of
the
rabbit
.
adams
places
however
a
great
focus
on
story
something
that
rabbits
donât
so
far
as
we
know
have
.
but
story
permeates
this
work
.
when
the
going
gets
tough
and
the
rabbits
with
hazel
need
reassuring
their
own
storyteller
dandelion
tells
stories
about
el-ahrairah
âthe
prince
with
a
thousand
enemiesâ
â
the
mythical
trickster
rabbit
.
not
only
do
they
have
stories
about
the
mythical
el-ahrairah
but
by
the
end
of
the
novel
it
is
clear
that
in
their
own
world
the
adventures
of
hazel
fiver
bigwig
dandelion
and
the
like
are
already
in
the
process
of
becoming
stories
that
rabbit
parents
tell
their
kittens
and
that
will
be
part
of
rabbit
lore
for
future
generations
.
the
chief
villain
in
the
book
a
very
violent
rabbit
called
general
woundwort
himself
becomes
a
figure
of
story
â
a
boogey
rabbit
that
rabbit
parents
use
to
keep
their
kittens
from
misbehaving
.
in
what
for
me
was
the
strangest
and
scariest
part
of
the
story
hazel
and
his
followers
who
have
escaped
their
warren
just
in
time
to
avoid
the
disaster
that
destroyed
it
have
come
to
a
place
that
appears
perfect
for
their
needs
â
it
is
spacious
the
rabbits
living
there
are
all
well
fed
and
they
appear
ready
to
welcome
the
exiles
.
their
even
temper
which
approaches
apathy
seems
odd
and
fiver
a
rabbit
with
second
sight
is
panicked
by
this
unusual
behavior
.
this
group
of
rabbits
has
become
accustomed
to
a
local
farmer
putting
out
farm
waste
for
them
to
eat
.
wire
traps
have
been
set
up
about
the
field
though
which
catch
and
kill
rabbits
which
then
become
food
for
the
farmer
.
the
rabbits
in
this
peculiar
warren
have
grown
accustomed
to
this
arrangement
.
they
have
lost
the
wariness
that
helps
rabbits
survive
in
the
wild
they
have
no
chief
rabbit
to
lead
them
for
no
leader
can
defend
against
the
random
death
of
the
wire
traps
and
they
never
speak
of
rabbits
who
have
gone
missing
.
once
a
rabbit
has
âgoneâ
all
act
as
if
she
never
existed
.
when
hazel
and
company
gather
together
with
these
rabbits
to
hear
their
teller
silverweed
they
are
puzzled
.
there
are
no
stories
of
el-ahrairah
or
other
rabbit
heroes
.
instead
silverweed
sings
songs
full
of
vague
statements
about
the
evanescence
of
life
and
encouraging
acceptance
of
a
world
in
which
rabbits
can
disappear
like
leaves
blowing
in
the
wind
.
adams
does
not
give
us
aesopâs
fables
a
book
about
humans
cast
in
animal
form
nor
does
he
give
us
a
book
about
rabbits
as
rabbits
.
if
you
want
that
there
are
plenty
of
books
available
about
rabbits
.
rather
we
get
some
strange
mix
â
a
book
in
which
a
clear
human
consciousness
with
the
human
love
of
and
need
for
stories
front
and
center
is
grafted
onto
rabbits
behaving
like
rabbits
but
which
speaks
to
much
larger
questions
of
bravery
honor
purpose
and
identity
.
and
if
you
can
get
past
the
strange
part
â
rabbits
with
human
consciousness
and
stories
â
youâll
be
amazed
at
the
job
adams
does
with
those
big
questions
.
there
is
an
audiobook
of
the
novel
very
well
read
by
ralph
cosham
.
and
the
animated
film
with
the
voices
of
john
hurt
ralph
richardson
and
zero
mostel
is
quite
a
nice
adaptation
but
not
for
kids
.
