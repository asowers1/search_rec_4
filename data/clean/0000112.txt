on

when
i
went
off
for
my
first
semester
of
college
my
father
gave
me
100
with
which
to
buy
textbooks
which
certainly
dates
me
.
after
buying
everything
for
my
classes
i
had
enough
money
left
over
to
buy
a
hard
cover
copy
of
``
watership
down
''
by
richard
adams
for
6.95
which
for
people
who
love
books
is
certainly
a
great
way
of
representing
the
ravages
of
inflation
over
the
years
.
i
decided
to
read
a
chapter
of
``
watership
down
''
each
night
before
going
to
bed
thereby
marking
the
beginning
of
my
obsession
with
reading
a
chapter
of
something
each
day
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
school
.
when
my
dorm
roommate
became
as
hooked
on
the
story
as
much
as
i
was
he
and
i
would
read
chapters
aloud
.
fifty
days
i
got
to
the
book
's
epilogue
with
the
same
sort
of
sadness
that
it
was
all
over
that
i
experienced
getting
to
the
end
of
the
``
the
lord
of
the
rings
''
trilogy.living
in
the
sandleford
warren
with
its
chief
rabbit
and
owsla
maintaining
a
comfortable
social
order
hazel
and
his
little
brother
fiver
are
content
enough
.
but
fiver
has
the
gift
of
prophecy
and
when
he
warns
that
the
warren
has
to
be
abandoned
right
away
or
they
are
all
going
to
die
hazel
and
a
small
circle
of
friends
believe
him
and
leave
despite
the
fact
that
have
no
idea
where
they
are
going
.
fiver
envisions
a
great
high
place
where
they
can
be
happy
and
safe
but
there
are
a
series
of
imposing
obstacles
to
overcome
from
not
only
humans
and
predators
but
other
wild
rabbits
as
well
.
consequently
the
basic
story
of
``
watership
down
''
is
the
ancient
quest
for
home
although
in
this
case
it
is
a
new
home
that
represents
a
wild
rabbit
's
idea
of
utopia.the
greatness
of
``
watership

''
rests
on
the
sense
of
realism
that
adams
brings
to
his
story

it
is
heartwarming
in
the
extreme
for
me
to
see
so
many
glowing
and
informative
reviews
about
this
incredible
book.i
read
watership
down
when
i
was
in
junior
high
and
remembered
liking
it
very
much
.
then
life
got
busy
and
i
pretty
much
forgot
about
it
.
but
occasionally
i
'd
see
it
on
the
bookshelves
at
my
local
library
or
bookstore
and
an
itch
would
start
in
the
back
of
my
mind
telling
me
that
i
should
revisit
its
magical
pages
.
so
this
winter
i
did
.
.
.how
wonderful
it
is
to
visit
such
a
fully
realized
world
created
by
the
human
mind
but
set
in
an
anthropomorphic
background
and
foreground
too.the
story
is
about
a
band
of
rabbits
--
-hazel
bigwig
fiver
dandelion
and
bluebell
--
-who
set
off
from
their
comfy
holes
to
find
a
new
rabbit
warren
on
the
plains
of
watership
down
.
they
leave
their
original
warren
because
fiver
a
small
brooding
rabbit
with
'the
sight
'
has
a
vision
of
it
being
destroyed
.
not
surprisingly
soon
after
they
leave
they
find
out
that
the
warren
had
been
destroyed
by
big
hrududil
tractors
that
dug
up
the
ground
and
killed
all
those
who
remained
behind.the
trials
and
tribulations
of
hazel
and
his
band
of
rogue
rabbits
carries
the
story
along
at
a
leisurely
pace
not
rushing
to
get
the
story
out
giving
rabbit
history
and
mythology
a
few
well-deserved
pages
too.after
hazel
and
his
fellow
bunnies
set
up
their
new
warren
on
watership
down
though
they
find
that
they
have
a
serious
problem
no
does
females
without
does
their
new
warren
is
doomed
to
failure
so
they
set
about
trying
to
locate
some
breeding
stock
.
but
what
they
encounter
is
a
terrible
warren
known
as
efrafa
run
by
the
overbearing
and
callous
general
woundwort
.
the
battle
between
watership
down

this
is
the
best
darn
book
i
ever
read
by
danny
smith
on
december
1
1999format
hardcover
a
lot
of
reviewers
teachers
and
other
people
that
like
to
make
themselves
sound
intellectually
mature
would
tell
you
that
in
order
to
enjoy
watership
down
or
any
other
book
for
that
matter
is
to
read
deep
meanings
in
to
every
aspect
of
the
book
.
please
do
yourself
a
favor
and
do
n't
torture
yourself
in
this
way
.
although
it
has
all
the
characteristics
of
a
great
book
a
modern
day
classic
even
and
could
be
full
of
sybolism
and
irony
i
feel
that
it
is
best
enjoyed
by
taking
it
for
what
it
is
a
great
story
about
a
group
of
rabbit
's
adventure
failure
success
self-discovery
and
their
long
journey
.
the
story
is
set
in
the
english
countryside
with
great
descriptions
of
the
surroundings
as
well
as
the
rabbits
and
their
lifestyle
.
it
is
told
from
a
rabbits
point
of
view
but
one
that
knows
human
behavior
as
well
and
somehow
adams
makes
the
whole
thing
realistic
.
the
book
is
about
a
group
of
rabbits
that
decide
to
leave
their
home
warren
after
fiver
a
sort
of
psychic
rabbit
tells
them
that
danger
is
on
the
way
.
and
so
they
begin
a
voyage
that
will
change
their
lives
forever
.
along
the
way
theyt
encounter
an
evil
warren
crows
a
fox
rivers
a
rabbit
farm
and
countless
other
dangers
.
their
final
destination
is
a
sort
of
``
rabbit
heaven
''
a
beautiful
safe
secure
piece
of
land
known
as
watership
down
.
also
included
in
the
book
is
a
whole
new
language
that
adams
somehow
brings
the
reader
to
understand
and
tales
of
how
frith
the
sun
god
was
so
impressed
with
el-arairah
a
folk
hero
that
he
granted
him
wonderful
boons
.
when
i
was
first
told
of
the
book
i
thought
it
would
be
a
cute
kids
book
.
i
was
completely
wrong
.
this
is
a
mature
book
that
would
probably
be
best
suited
for
middle-school
students
through
adults
.
i
would
recommend
this
book
to
anyone
that
is
n't
afraid
to
spend
a
little
time
and
become
fully
engrossed
in
a
wonderful
tale
.
