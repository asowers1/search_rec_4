'i
am
reaching
the
end
of
my
ordeal
''
says
umberto
eco
when
we
meet
.
happily
i
do
n't
take
this
personally
.
eco
â
philosopher
semiotician
novelist
bibliophile
and
all-round
brainbox
â
has
been
on
a
20-day
global
tour
to
promote
his
new
novel
the
prague
cemetery
and
says
at
times
he
has
barely
known
what
city
he
was
in
.
eco
who
will
be
80
in
january
does
n't
look
too
bad
for
his
ordeal
.
his
rotundity
means
he
sits
a
little
awkwardly
in
his
chair
but
he
is
a
lively
playful
interviewee
chewing
on
a
small
cigar
throughout
.
he
gave
up
smoking
them
eight
years
ago
but
still
likes
to
have
one
in
his
mouth
and
hopes
some
of
the
nicotine
gets
through
.
he
has
a
rasping
voice
and
an
idiosyncratic
take
on
english
.
the
conversation
occasionally
breaks
down
when
i
use
expressions
he
does
n't
quite
grasp
.
he
misunderstands
when
i
ask
him
whether
the
prague
cemetery
is
as
some
critics
have
suggested
a
``
return
to
form
''
for
him
form
is
a
sporting
rather
than
a
literary
term
.
anyway
we
battle
on
.
the
elephant
in
our
cramped
little
room
is
that
the
new
book
is
not
a
return
to
form
whether
literary
or
sporting
.
set
in
the
second
half
of
the
19th
century
and
following
the
fortunes
of
master
forger
murderer
and
general
bad
egg
simone
simonini
who
manages
to
have
a
hand
in
most
of
the
great
events
of
that
period
italian
unification
franco-prussian
war
paris
commune
dreyfus
affair
it
is
a
wearying
read
.
in
english
at
least
.
perhaps
it
sparkles
in
italian
.
whether
or
not
it
is
a
return
to
form
it
is
certainly
a
return
to
eco
's
favourite
subject
â
conspiracies
.
simonini
is
presented
as
the
originator
of
the
protocols
of
the
elders
of
zion
the
early
20th-century
fake
text
that
purported
to
detail
a
jewish
conspiracy
aimed
at
world
domination
.
following
its
publication
in
russia
in
1903
it
was
widely
read
and
believed
despite
being
shown
to
have
been
plagiarised
from
fictional
sources
.
hitler
quoted
it
extensively
and
even
now
its
poison
circulates
.
eco
pieces
together
what
little
is
known
of
the
origins
of
the
text
and
offers
simonini
an
amoral
italian
living
in
paris
as
the
originator
of
the
most
toxic
of
all
forgeries
.
conspiracies
in
general
and
the
protocols
in
particular
have
been
recurrent
themes
in
eco
's
work
notably
in
his
second
novel
foucault
's
pendulum
where
as
a
joke
three
nondescript
book
editors
concoct
a
grand
conspiracy
that
comes
to
take
over
their
lives
.
why
do
the
protocols
preoccupy
him
``
as
a
scholar
i
am
interested
in
the
philosophy
of
language
semiotics
call
it
what
you
want
and
one
of
the
main
features
of
the
human
language
is
the
possibility
of
lying
.
a
dog
does
n't
lie
.
when
it
barks
it
means
there
is
somebody
outside
.
''
animals
do
not
lie
human
beings
do
.
``
from
lies
to
forgeries
the
step
is
not
so
long
and
i
have
written
technical
essays
on
the
logic
of
forgeries
and
on
the
influence
of
forgeries
on
history
.
the
most
famous
and
terrible
of
those
forgeries
is
the
protocols
.
''
eco
says
it
is
not
conspiracies
that
attract
him
but
the
paranoia
that
allows
them
to
flourish
.
``
there
are
many
small
conspiracies
and
most
of
them
are
exposed
''
he
says
.
``
but
the
paranoia
of
the
universal
conspiracy
is
more
powerful
because
it
is
everlasting
.
you
can
never
discover
it
because
you
do
n't
know
who
is
there
.
it
is
a
psychological
temptation
of
our
species
.
karl
popper
wrote
a
beautiful
essay
on
that
in
which
he
said
it
started
with
homer
.
everything
that
happens
in
troy
was
plotted
the
day
before
on
the
top
of
olympus
by
the
gods
.
it
's
a
way
not
to
feel
responsible
for
something
.
that
's
why
dictatorships
use
the
notion
of
universal
conspiracy
as
a
weapon
.
for
the
first
10
years
of
my
life
i
was
educated
by
fascists
at
school
and
they
used
a
universal
conspiracy
â
that
you
the
englishman
the
jews
and
the
capitalists
were
plotting
against
the
poor
italian
people
.
for
hitler
it
was
the
same
.
and
berlusconi
has
spent
all
his
electoral
campaigns
speaking
of
the
double
conspiracy
of
the
judges
and
the
communists
.
there
are
no
more
communists
around
even
if
you
look
for
them
with
a
lamp
but
for
berlusconi
they
were
there
trying
to
take
over
.

he
probably
does
not
intend
to
elide
hitler
and
berlusconi
but
nor
is
he
a
fan
of
italy
's
recently
departed
prime
minister
.
eco
has
always
been
a
prominent
figure
on
the
political
left
and
has
opposed
berlusconi
since
his
first
stint
as
pm
in
the
mid-1990s
.
he
is
pleased
that
the
great
partygoer
has
fallen
but
warns
against
writing
him
off
suggesting
he
may
try
to
return
after
the
elections
due
in
2013
.
``
berlusconi
is
a
genius
in
communication
''
says
eco
.
``
otherwise
he
would
never
have
become
so
rich
.
from
the
beginning
he
identified
his
target
â
middle-aged
people
who
watch
television
.
young
people
do
not
watch
television
they
are
on
the
internet
.
the
people
who
support
berlusconi
are
50-
and
60-year-old
ladies
and
retired
people
who
in
a
country
with
an
ageing
population
make
a
powerful
electoral
force
.
so
even
some
of
his
famous
blunders
may
be
blunders
for
me
and
you
but
probably
for
the
provincial
60-year-old
lady
or
gentlemen
they
are
not
.
his
appeal
was
'pay
less
taxes
'
.
when
the
premier
says
you
are
right
not
to
pay
taxes
you
are
pleased
.
''
how
could
a
culture
as
intellectual
and
artistic
as
italy
's
have
elected
such
a
buffoon
``
berlusconi
was
strongly
anti-intellectual
''
he
says
``
and
boasted
that
he
had
n't
read
a
novel
for
20
years
.
there
was
a
fear
of
the
intellectual
as
a
critical
power
and
in
this
sense
there
was
a
clash
between
berlusconi
and
the
intellectual
world
.
but
italy
is
not
an
intellectual
country
.
on
the
subway
in
tokyo
everybody
reads
.
in
italy
they
do
n't
.
do
n't
evaluate
italy
from
the
fact
that
it
produced
raphael
and
michelangelo
.
''
eco
's
new
book
has
been
attacked
by
some
for
regurgitating
an
antisemitic
text
but
he
argues
that
the
protocols
can
easily
be
found
on
the
internet
and
that
``
weak
readers
''
who
misunderstand
his
purpose
will
be
misled
elsewhere
.
``
you
are
not
responsible
for
perverse
readings
of
your
book
''
he
says
.
``
catholic
priests
said
do
n't
give
madame
bovary
to
a
young
girl
to
read
because
she
might
be
seduced
by
adultery
.
''
does
it
bother
him
that
the
half-dozen
novels
he
has
produced
since
the
name
of
the
rose
propelled
him
to
fictional
fame
in
the
early
1980s
have
had
a
mixed
reception
``
you
are
always
shocked
by
how
different
critics
'
opinions
are
''
he
says
.
``
i
think
a
book
should
be
judged
10
years
later
after
reading
and
re-reading
it
.
i
was
always
defined
as
too
erudite
and
philosophical
too
difficult
.
then
i
wrote
a
novel
that
is
not
erudite
at
all
that
is
written
in
plain
language
the
mysterious
flame
of
queen
loana
and
among
my
novels
it
is
the
one
that
has
sold
the
least
.
so
probably
i
am
writing
for
masochists
.
it
's
only
publishers
and
some
journalists
who
believe
that
people
want
simple
things
.
people
are
tired
of
simple
things
.
they
want
to
be
challenged
.
''
eco
had
a
distinguished
30-year
career
in
the
academic
world
with
sidelines
making
cultural
tv
programmes
and
working
as
an
editor
in
milan
before
the
name
of
the
rose
.
why
did
he
feel
the
need
to
add
fiction
to
an
already
overloaded
cv
in
part
he
says
it
was
accident
.
a
friend
asked
him
to
write
a
short
detective
novel
for
a
new
series
she
was
preparing
.
he
told
her
that
if
he
did
it
would
be
set
in
the
middle
ages
and
would
have
to
be
500
pages
.
that
was
too
big
for
the
proposed
series
but
the
idea
had
been
planted
in
his
mind
or
as
he
prefers
his
belly
and
a
publishing
phenomenon
was
born
.
even
without
her
intervention
however
he
implies
that
he
would
eventually
have
written
novels
.
the
notion
of
poisoning
a
monk
appealed
to
him
and
he
already
had
a
list
of
monkish
names
filed
away
in
his
drawer
for
possible
use
.
``
i
have
always
had
a
narrative
impulse
''
he
says
.
``
i
wrote
stories
and
beginnings
of
novels
at
the
age
of
10
or
12
.
i
then
satisfied
my
taste
for
narrative
by
writing
essays
.
all
my
researches
have
the
structure
of
a
whodunit
.
''
one
of
his
professors
pointed
out
that
even
his
doctoral
thesis
on
thomas
aquinas
had
that
structure
with
the
conclusion
teasingly
arrived
at
after
a
long
process
of
divination
.
``
i
recognised
he
was
right
and
that
i
was
right
and
that
research
must
be
done
this
way
.
i
satisfied
my
narrative
impulse
when
my
kids
were
small
by
telling
them
stories
and
then
when
they
were
grown
up
i
felt
the
need
to
write
fiction
.
it
happened
to
me
as
it
happens
to
people
when
they
fall
in
love
.
'why
did
you
fall
in
love
that
day
that
month
with
that
person
are
you
crazy
why
'
you
do
n't
know
.
it
happens
.
''
the
name
of
the
rose
made
eco
's
reputation
as
a
novelist
but
it
has
also
proved
difficult
to
match
.
``
sometimes
i
say
i
hate
the
name
of
the
rose
''
he
admits
``
because
the
following
books
maybe
were
better
.
but
it
happens
to
many
writers
.
gabriel
garcía
márquez
can
write
50
books
but
he
will
be
remembered
always
for
cien
años
de
soledad
one
hundred
years
of
solitude
.
every
time
i
publish
a
new
novel
sales
of
the
name
of
the
rose
go
up
.
what
is
the
reaction
'ah
a
new
book
of
eco
.
but
i
have
never
read
the
name
of
the
rose
.
'
which
by
the
way
costs
less
because
it
is
in
paperback
.
''
he
laughs
as
he
does
frequently
.
eco
's
great
virtue
is
that
he
is
an
intellectual
who
does
n't
take
himself
too
seriously
.
life
like
fiction
is
a
wonderful
game
.
it
is
claimed
that
he
called
the
film
of
the
name
of
the
rose
a
travesty
but
that
seems
unlikely
.
he
says
only
that
a
film
can
not
do
everything
a
book
can
.
``
a
book
like
this
is
a
club
sandwich
with
turkey
salami
tomato
cheese
lettuce
.
and
the
movie
is
obliged
to
choose
only
the
lettuce
or
the
cheese
eliminating
everything
else
â
the
theological
side
the
political
side
.
it
's
a
nice
movie
.
i
was
told
that
a
girl
entered
a
bookstore
and
seeing
the
books
said
'oh
they
have
already
made
a
book
out
of
it
.
'
''
more
laughter
.
the
name
of
the
rose
sold
â
and
continues
to
sell
â
by
the
bucketload
.
it
made
him
rich
famous
sought
after
.
but
he
chose
to
carry
on
teaching
at
bologna
university
and
to
keep
up
his
academic
work
.
his
bibliography
of
non-fiction
works
on
language
culture
and
belief
is
vast
and
forbidding
.
hidden
behind
eco
the
novelist
and
eco
the
performer
is
a
serious
philosopher
and
literary
critic
.
it
is
often
said
that
he
constructs
his
novels
out
of
other
books
.
the
prague
cemetery
both
explores
the
19th-century
novels
that
were
plagiarised
in
the
protocols
and
is
structured
like
one
.
alexandre
dumas
is
the
presiding
spirit
in
particular
his
novel
joseph
balsamo
and
intertextuality
the
name
of
eco
's
fictional
game
.
he
has
adored
books
since
he
was
a
child
growing
up
in
the
town
of
alessandria
in
northern
italy
with
not
very
bookish
``
petit
bourgeois
''
parents
but
a
grandmother
who
loved
reading
.
he
read
voraciously
and
still
does
.
his
two
libraries
at
the
homes
he
shares
with
his
german-born
wife
renate
ramge
in
milan
and
rimini
contain
50000
books
including
1200
rare
titles
.
he
has
called
books
``
the
corridors
of
the
mind
''
and
recently
co-wrote
an
extended
love
letter
to
the
printed
text
called
this
is
not
the
end
of
the
book
.
but
that
does
not
make
him
a
digital
counter-revolutionary
.
indeed
to
save
having
to
carry
a
bag
full
of
books
on
this
trip
he
has
instead
brought
along
an
ipad
with
30
titles
downloaded
.
he
nevertheless
stands
by
his
contention
that
this
is
not
the
end
of
the
book
.
reading
devices
are
fine
for
long
journeys
and
have
advantages
for
reference
books
but
committed
readers
will
always
crave
physicality
â
``
not
just
peter
pan
but
my
peter
pan
''
as
he
puts
it
.
the
fact
that
he
can
accommodate
everything
from
illuminated
manuscripts
to
ipads
is
typical
.
he
is
optimistic
eclectic
eternally
young
interested
in
everything
as
at
home
discoursing
on
peanuts
as
he
is
on
proust
.
i
ask
him
how
he
will
be
remembered
â
as
novelist
critic
or
polymath
``
i
leave
it
up
to
you
''
he
says
.
``
usually
a
novelist
has
a
longer-lasting
life
than
an
academic
unless
you
are
immanuel
kant
or
john
locke
.
illustrious
thinkers
of
50
years
ago
have
already
been
forgotten
.
''
so
is
he
resigned
to
being
remembered
for
the
name
of
the
rose
rather
than
his
contribution
to
semiotics
``
at
the
beginning
''
he
says
``
i
had
the
impression
that
my
novels
had
nothing
to
do
with
my
academic
interests
.
then
i
discovered
that
critics
found
many
connections
and
the
editors
of
the
library
of
living
philosophers
decided
that
my
novels
had
to
be
taken
into
account
as
a
philosophical
