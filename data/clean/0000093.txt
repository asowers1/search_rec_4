eco
being
a
semiotician
is
hailed
by
semiotics
students
who
like
to
use
his
novel
to
explain
their
discipline
.
the
techniques
of
telling
stories
within
stories
partial
fictionalization
and
purposeful
linguistic
ambiguity
are
all
apparent
.
the
solution
to
the
central
murder
mystery
hinges
on
the
contents
of
aristotle
's
book
on
comedy
of
which
no
copy
survives
eco
nevertheless
plausibly
describes
it
and
has
his
characters
react
to
it
appropriately
in
their
medieval
setting
â
which
though
realistically
described
is
partly
based
on
eco
's
scholarly
guesses
and
imagination
.
it
is
virtually
impossible
to
untangle
fact
history
from
fiction
conjecture
in
the
novel
.
through
the
motive
of
this
lost
and
possibly
suppressed
book
which
might
have
aestheticized
the
farcical
the
unheroic
and
the
skeptical
eco
also
makes
an
ironically
slanted
plea
for
tolerance
and
against
dogmatic
or
self-sufficient
metaphysical
truths
â
an
angle
which
reaches
the
surface
in
the
final
chapters.1
umberto
eco
is
a
significant
postmodernist
theorist
and
the
name
of
the
rose
is
a
postmodern
novel.2
the
quote
in
the
novel
``
books
always
speak
of
other
books
and
every
story
tells
a
story
that
has
already
been
told
''
refers
to
a
postmodern
idea
that
all
texts
perpetually
refer
to
other
texts
rather
than
external
reality.2
in
true
postmodern
style
the
novel
ends
with
uncertainty
``
very
little
is
discovered
and
the
detective
is
defeated
''
postscript
.
william
of
baskerville
solves
the
mystery
in
part
by
mistake
he
thought
there
was
a
pattern
but
it
in
fact
numerous
``
patterns
''
were
involved
and
combined
with
haphazard
mistakes
by
the
killers
.
william
concludes
in
fatigue
that
there
``
was
no
pattern
''
.
thus
eco
turns
the
modernist
quest
for
finality
certainty
and
meaning
on
its
head
leaving
the
overall
plot
partly
the
result
of
accident
and
arguably
without
meaning.2
even
the
novel
's
title
alludes
to
the
possibility
of
many
meanings
or
of
nebulous
meaning
eco
saying
in
the
postscript
he
chose
the
title
``
because
the
rose
is
a
symbolic
figure
so
rich
in
meanings
that
by
now
it
hardly
has
any
meaning
left
''
.3
the
aedificium
's
labyrinthedit
the
mystery
revolves
around
the
abbey
library
situated
in
a
fortified
tower
called
the
aedificium
.
this
structure
has
three
floors
-
the
ground
floor
contains
the
kitchen
and
refectory
the
first
floor
the
scriptorium
and
the
top
floor
is
occupied
by
the
library.4
the
two
lower
floors
are
open
to
all
while
only
the
librarian
may
enter
the
last
.
a
catalogue
of
books
is
kept
in
the
scriptorium
where
manuscripts
are
read
and
copied
.
a
monk
who
wishes
to
read
a
book
would
send
a
request
to
the
librarian
who
if
he
thought
the
request
justified
would
bring
it
to
the
scriptorium
.
finally
the
library
is
in
the
form
of
a
labyrinth
whose
secret
only
the
librarian
and
the
assistant
librarian
know
.
5
the
aedificium
has
four
towers
at
the
four
cardinal
points
and
the
top
floor
of
each
has
seven
rooms
on
the
outside
surrounding
a
central
room
.
there
are
another
eight
rooms
on
the
outer
walls
and
sixteen
rooms
in
the
centre
of
the
maze
.
thus
the
library
has
a
total
of
fifty-six
rooms.6
each
room
has
a
scroll
containing
a
verse
from
the
book
of
revelation
.
the
first
letter
of
the
verse
is
the
letter
corresponding
to
that
room.7
the
letters
of
adjacent
rooms
read
together
give
the
name
of
a
region
e.g
.
hibernia
in
the
west
tower
and
those
rooms
contain
books
from
that
region

titleedit
much
attention
has
been
paid
to
the
mystery
of
what
the
title
of
the
novel
refers
to
.
in
fact
eco
has
stated
that
his
intention
was
to
find
a
``
totally
neutral
title
''
.3
in
one
version
of
the
story
when
he
had
finished
writing
the
novel
eco
hurriedly
suggested
some
ten
names
for
it
and
asked
a
few
of
his
friends
to
choose
one
.
they
chose
the
name
of
the
rose.9
in
another
version
of
the
story
eco
had
wanted
the
neutral
title
adso
of
melk
but
that
was
vetoed
by
his
publisher
and
then
the
title
the
name
of
the
rose
``
came
to
me
virtually
by
chance
.
''
the
book
's
last
line
``
stat
rosa
pristina
nomine
nomina
nuda
tenemus
''
translates
as
``
the
primordial
rose
abides
only
in
its
name
we
hold
names
stripped
.
''
the
general
sense
as
eco
pointed
out10
was
that
from
the
beauty
of
the
past
now
disappeared
we
hold
only
the
name
.
in
this
novel
the
lost
``
rose
''
could
be
seen
as
aristotle
's
book
on
comedy
now
forever
lost
the
exquisite
library
now
destroyed
or
the
beautiful
peasant
girl
now
dead
.
we
only
know
them
by
the
description
adso
provides
us
â
we
only
have
the
name
of
the
book
on
comedy
not
its
contents
.
as
adso
points
out
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
day
he
does
not
even
know
the
name
of
the
peasant
girl
to
lament
her
.
does
this
mean
she
does
not
endure
at
all
perhaps
this
is
a
deliberate
mis-translation
.
this
quote
has
also
been
translated
as
``
yesterday
's
rome
stands
only
in
name
we
hold
only
empty
names
''
.
this
line
is
a
verse
by
twelfth
century
monk
bernard
of
cluny
also
known
as
bernard
of
morlaix
.
medieval
manuscripts
of
this
line
are
not
in
agreement
but
the
best
are
secure
for
roma
.
roma
here
introduces
a
``
false
''
quantity
with
a
short-o
for
the
classical
long-o
thus
a
foolish
scribe
or
a
mere
fool
wrote
the
``
classically
impeccable
''
rosa
which
betrays
the
overall
context
and
flexible
prosody
of
bernard
.
eco
quotes
one
medieval
variant
verbatim11
but
eco
was
not
aware
at
the
time
of
the
text
more
commonly
printed
in
modern
editions
in
which
the

to

roma
not
to

rosa.12
the
alternative
text
with
its

runs

here
also
has

the

things
a

adso

melk
is
the
site
of
a
famous
medieval
library
at

the
blind
librarian
jorge
from
burgos
is
a
nod
to
argentinian
writer
jorge
luis
borges
a
major
influence
on
eco
.
borges
was
blind
during
his
later
years
and
was
also
director
of
argentina
's
national
library
his
short
story
``
the
library
of
babel
''
is
a
clear
inspiration
for
the
secret
library
in
eco
's
book
``
the
library
is
composed
of
an
indefinite
perhaps
infinite
number
of
hexagonal
galleries
with
enormous
ventilation
shafts
in
the
middle
encircled
by
very
low
railings

''
another
of
borges

stories
``

features
a
blind
librarian

in

a
number
of
other
themes
drawn
from

of
borges
's
works
are
used
throughout
the
name
of
the
rose
labyrinths
mirrors
sects
and
obscure
manuscripts
and
books
.
the
ending
also
owes
a
debt
to
borges
's
``
death
and
the
compass
''
in
which
a
detective
proposes
a
theory
for
the
behavior
of
a
murderer
.
the
murderer
learns
of
the
theory
and
uses
it
to
trap
the
detective
.
in
the
name
of
the
rose
the
librarian
jorge
uses
william
's
belief
that
the
murders
are
based
on
the
revelation
of
john
to
misdirect
william
though
in
eco
's
tale
the
detective
succeeds
in
solving
the
crime

the
``
poisoned
page
''
gimmick
is
taken
from
the
film

italian
director
dino
risi.14
eco
seems
also
to
have
been
aware
of
rudyard
kipling
's
short
story
the
eye
of
allah
which
touches
on
many
of
the
same
themes
â
optics
manuscript-illumination
music
medicine
priestly
authority

the

attitude
to

some
time
at
the
university
of

while
writing
the
book

throughout

are
latin
quotes
authentic
and
apocryphal
.
there
are
also
discussions
of
the
philosophy
of
aristotle

of
a
variety
of
millenarist
heresies

those

saint
michael
's
abbey
and
the
alps
of
susa
valley
piedmont
william
of
ockham
who
lived
during
the
time
at
which
the
novel
is
set
first
put
forward
the
principle
known
as
``
ockham
's
razor
''
often
summarised
as
the
dictum
that
one
should
always
accept
as
most-likely
the
simplest
explanation
that
accounts
for
all
the
facts
a
method
used
by
william
of
baskerville
in
the
novel
.
the
book
describes
monastic
life
in
the
14th
century
.
the
action
takes
place
at
a
benedictine
abbey
during
the
controversy
surrounding
the
apostolic
poverty
between
branches
of
franciscans
and
dominicans
see
renewed
controversy
on
the
question
of
poverty
.
the
setting
was
inspired
by
monumental
saint
michael
's
abbey
in
susa
valley
piedmont
and
visited
by
umberto
eco.15not
in
citation
given
the
spirituals
abhor
wealth
bordering
on
the
apostolics
or
dulcinian
heresy
.
the
book
highlights
this
tension
that
existed
within
christianity
during
the
medieval
era
the
spirituals
one
faction
within
the
franciscan
order
demanded
that
the
church
should
abandon
all
wealth
and
some
heretical
sects
began
killing
the
well-to-do
while
the
majority
of
the
franciscans
and
the
clergy
took
to
a
broader
interpretation
of
the
gospel
.
a
number
of
the
characters
such
as
the
inquisitor
bernard
gui
ubertino
of
casale
and
the
minorite
michael
of
cesena
are
historical
figures
though
the
novel
's
characterization
of
them
is
not
always
historically
accurate
.
dante
alighieri
and
his
comedy
are
mentioned
once
in
passing
.
however
eco
notes
in
a
companion
book
that
he
had
to
site
the
monastery
in
mountains
so
it
would
experience
early
frosts
in
order
for
that
action
to
take
place
at
a
time
when
bernard
gui
could
have
been
in
the
area
.
for
the
purposes
of
the
plot
he
needed
a
quantity
of
pig
blood
but
at
that
time
pigs
were
not
usually
slaughtered
until
a
frost
had
arrived
.
later
in
the
year
gui
was
known
to
have
been
away
from
italy
and
could
not
have
participated
in
the
events
at
the
monastery
.
part
of
the
dialogue
in
the
inquisition
scene
of
the
novel
is
lifted
bodily
from
the
historical
bernard
's
own
manual
for
inquisitors
the
practica
inquisitionis
heretice
pravitatis
for
example
the
dialogue
``
what
do
you
believe
''
``
what
do
you
believe
my
lord
''
``
i
believe
in
all
that
the
creed
teaches
.
''
``
so
i
believe
my
lord
''
whereupon
bernard
points
out
that
what
remigius
the
cellarer
is
saying
is
not
that
he
remigius
himself
believes
in
the
creed
but
that
he
believes
that
bernard
believes
in
the
creed
.
this
is
itself
an
example
given
by
bernard
in
his
book
to
warn
inquisitors
against
the
slipperiness
and
manipulation
of
words
by
heretics
.
this
usage
of
bernard
's
own
book
by
eco
is
self-consciously
of
a
piece
with
his
perspective
that
``
books
always
speak
of
other
books
''
in
this
case
the
author
makes
his
character
bernard
speak
the
historical
bernard
's
own
words
literally
as
the
latter
's
text
becomes
part
of
the
drama
played
out
in
the
novel
.
adso
's
description
of
the
portal
of
the
monastery
is
recognisably
that
of
the
portal
of
the
church
at
moissac
france.citation
needed
there
is
also
a
quick
reference
to
a
famous
``
