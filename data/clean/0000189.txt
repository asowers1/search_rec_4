this
disney
feature-length
cartoon
combines
the
most
entertaining
elements
of
lewis
carroll
's
alice
in
wonderland
and
through
the
looking
glass
.
chasing
after
the
white
rabbit
who
runs
into
view
singing
``
i
'm
late
i
'm
late
''
alice
falls
down
the
rabbit
hole
into
the
topsy-turvy
alternate
world
of
wonderland
.
she
grows
and
shrinks
after
following
the
instructions
of
a
haughty
caterpillar
attends
a
``
very
merry
unbirthday
''
party
in
the
garden
of
the
mad
hatter
and
the
march
hare
stands
in
awe
as
the
cheshire
cat
spouts
philosophy
listens
in
rapt
attention
as
tweedledum
and
tweedledee
relate
the
story
of
the
walrus
and
the
carpenter
a
sequence
usually
cut
when
alice
is
shown
on
tv
and
closes
out
her
day
with
a
hectic
croquet
game
at
the
home
of
the
red
queen
.
the
music
and
production
design
of
alice
in
wonderland
is
marvelous
but
the
film
is
too
much
of
a
good
thing
much
too
frantic
to
do
full
honor
to
the
whimsical
carroll
original
and
far
too
episodic
to
hang
together
as
a
unified
feature
film
.
one
tactical
error
is
having
alice
weep
at
mid-point
declaring
her
wish
to
go
home
this
is
alice
in
wonderland
walt
not
wizard
of
oz
its
storytelling
shortcomings
aside
alice
in
wonderland
is
superior
family
entertainment
never
mind
the
efforts
in
the
1970s
to
palm
off
the
picture
as
a
psychedelic
``
head
''

the

the

alice

the
marvelous
surrealistic
design
with
beautiful
vibrant
colors
and
curious
geometric
shapes
that
even
seems
to
borrow
from
expressionism
are
sadly
not
enough
to
compensate
for
the
film
's
excess
of
songs
and
glaring
lack
of
focus
given
its
frustratingly
episodic
structure
.

though
ultimately
not
the
most
memorable
disney
experience
alice
in
wonderland
is
a
charming
visually
stunning
film
that
--
while
dated
--
is
nonetheless
enjoyable

this
is
how
the
story
of
alice
in
wonderland
should
be
done
tim
burton
.
that
aside
alice
in
wonderland
is
probably
one
of
disney
's
most
creative
animated
films
to
date
just
due
to
how
crazy
they
could
go
with
tis
story
seeing
how
nothing
makes
sense
in
this
nonsensical
animated
world
of
wonderland
.
alice
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
animated
film
leads
and
the
side
characters
are
some
of
disney
's
best
mainly
the
mad
hatter
and
march
hare
even
though
they
are
n't
even
in
the
film
for
fifteen
minutes
.
my
favorite
character
however
is
the
cheshire
cat
not
just
for
how
sterling
holloway
portrays
him
but
also
how
you
never
know
what
side
he
is
on
if
he
's
a
good
guy
or
a
bad
guy
and
i
really
enjoy
characters
that
are
done
like
that
.
the
music
is
also
very
good
for
the
film
my
favorite
being
the
story
of
the
carpenter
and
walrus
just
for
how
strange
it
is
.

a
classic
retelling
of
lewis
carroll
's
alice
in
wonderland
this
is
one
of
the
strangest
films
in
disney
's
catalogue
.
i
remember
watching
this
as
a
kid
and
thought
it
was
really
creepy
for
some
odd
reason
.
maybe
it
was
the
cheshire
cat
with
that
grin
of
his
or
the
mad
hatter
.
either
way
alice
in
wonderland
was
one
of
those
disney
films
that
creeped
me
out
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
film
but
it
kind
of
made
me
feel
uneasy
.
this
is
nonetheless
a
good
adaptation
of
a
classic
tale
.
this
is
a
great
film
that
might
make
you
raise
an
eyebrow
or
two
however
if
you
love
disney
films
then
this
is
yet
another
one
worth
checking
out
.
alice
in
wonderland
sure
is
an
eccentric
surreal
cinematic
experience
but
it
's
also
one
that
you
'll
never
forget
.
the
film
has
colorful
characters
and
a
good
cast
.
like
i
said
alice
in
wonderland
is
weird
but
it
is
definitely
an
entertaining
film
one
that
will
definitely
appeal
to
disney
enthusiasts
.
of
all
the
films
that
disney
has
put
out
alice
in
wonderland
may
be
the
one
that
stands
out
the
most
.
the
sheer
eccentricity
of
the
film
has
made
its
reputation
secure
among
fans
of
disney
.
the
film
is
definitely
out
of
this
world
and
very
different
from
others
in
disney
's
past
.
for
what
it
's
worth
this
is
still
a
must
see
film
if
you
want
to
check
all
the
essential
disney
classics
as
this
is
one
of
the
most
memorable
of
them
all
.
not
the
most
perfect
film
that
disney
has
made
but
definitely
a
stunning
ride
nonetheless
.
