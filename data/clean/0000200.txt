is
praised
as
a
sacrificial
hero
and
bruce

production
development
warner
bros.
president
of
production
jeff
robinov
had
hoped
a
third
film
would
be
released
in
2011
or
2012
.
nolan
wanted
the
story
for
the
third
installment
to
keep
him
emotionally
invested
.
``
on
a
more
superficial
level
i
have
to
ask
the
question
''
he
reasoned
``
how
many
good
third
movies
in
a
franchise
can
people
name
''
nolan
only
agreed
to
a
third
film
on
the
basis
of
finding
a
worthwhile
story
fearing
that
he
would
become
bored
halfway
through
production
if
he
discovered
the
film
to
be
unnecessary
.
by
december
2008
nolan
completed
a
rough
story
outline
before
he
committed
himself
to
inception
.
later
in
december
alan
f.
horn
confirmed
that
while
discussions
with
nolan
about
a
third
film
were
ongoing
no
casting
had
been
done
and
horn
denied
all
such
rumors
.
before
nolan
confirmed
his
involvement
gary
oldman
had
said
he
was
confident
nolan
would
return
.
it
was
not
until
february
9
2010
that
it
was
announced
that
nolan
had
``
cracked
''
the
story
of
a
sequel
to
the
dark
knight
and
was
committed
to
return
to
the
project
.
shortly
afterward
it
was
announced
david
s.
goyer
and
jonathan
nolan
were
working
on
a
screenplay
.
goyer
would
leave
the
project
during
pre-production
to
begin
work
on
man
of
steel
jonathan
continued
writing
the
script
based
on
the
story
by
his
brother
chris
and
goyer
.
the
film
's
storyline
takes
influence
from
the
story
arcs
in
the
batman
comics
the
dark
knight
returns
knightfall
and
no
manâs
land
.
nolan
confirmed
the
joker
would
not
return
in
the
third
film
and
dismissed
rumors
that
he
considered
using
unused
footage
of
heath
ledger
from
the
dark
knight
.
the
dark
knight
rises
will
reunite
nolan
with
many
of
his
past
collaborators
including
cinematographer
wally
pfister
production
designer
nathan
crowley
editor
lee
smith
costume
designer
lindy
hemming
special
effects
supervisors
paul
franklin
and
chris
corbould
and
composer
hans
zimmer
.
filming
the
film
has
an
estimated
budget
of
250
million
.
nolan
has
elected
not
to
film
in
3-d
but
has
instead
stated
that
he
intends
to
focus
on
improving
image
quality
and
scale
using
the
imax
format
.
the
dark
knight
rises
will
feature
more
scenes
shot
in
imax
than
the
dark
knight
nolan
's
wife
and
co-producer
emma
thomas
stated
that
the
film
will
have
between
forty
and
fifty
minutes
of
footage
shot
in
imax
by
comparison
the
dark
knight
contained
thirty
minutes
depending
on
the
editing
process
.
nolan
has
had
several
meetings
with
imax
vice-president
david
keighley
to
work
on
the
logistics
of
projecting
films
in
digital
imax
venues
.
wally
pfister
had
expressed
interest
in
shooting
the
film
entirely
in
imax
but
because
of
the
considerable
noise
made
by
imax
cameras
35mm
and
