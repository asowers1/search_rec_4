this
past
week
reports
began
to
circulate
that
theâ
amazing
spider-man
spinoff
sinister
six
a
film
aboutâ
a
team
of
spider-man
super
villains
-â
might
be
in
serious
danger
of
being
cancelled
.
not
so
it
turns
out
as
sonycolumbia
pictures
has
announced
an
official
fall
2016
release
date
for
writerdirector
drew
goddards
sinister
six
movie
.
meanwhile
amazing

director
marc
webbs
amazing
spider-man
3
has
been
pushed
to
2018
presumably
the
may
2018
spot
that
sony
is
currently
holding
onto
.
goddard
stepped
down
as
the
showrunner
for
marvel
studios
upcomingâ
daredevil
series
a
couple
months
back
in
order
to
concentrate
his
efforts
on
getting
sinister
six
ready
.
however
recent
comments
made
by
certain
other
prominent
members
of
the
amazing
spider-man
franchise
brain
trust
roberto
orci
and
alex
kurtzman
to
be
exact
indicated
that
sonys
original
plans
for
the
series
future
mayve
changed
worst
case
scenario
that
the
blueprints
for
buildingâ
a
shared
spider-man
movie
universe
mayve
been
abandoned
in
reaction
to
amazing
spider-man
2s
overall
shaky
critical
reception
and
box
office
drop-off
from
its
predecessor
.
sony
however
has
now
revealed
its
hand
of
cards
not
so
coincidentally
as
the
2014
international
comic-con
gets
up
and
running
.
sinister
six
now
has
a
november
11th
2016
release
date
one
week
before
wb
releases
its
harry
potter
spinoff
fantastic
beasts
where
to
find
them
.
the
month
of
november
has
long
served
franchises
such
as
harry
potter
and
james
bond
well
among
others
while
thor
the
dark
world
proved
last
year
that
superhero
movies
can
also
thrive
at
the
box
office
during
that
frame
.
however
there
are
some
pressing
questions
to
ask
about
sinister
six
.
for
one
will
the
movie
feature
andrew
garfield
as
peter
parkerspidey
seeing
how
the
actor
previously
said
hes
only
contracted
for
three
spider-man
filmsâ
-
and
if
the
final
movie
thats
part
of
garfields
current
deal
is
meant
to
beâ
amazing
spider-man
3
as
would
make
the
most
sense
does
that
mean
sinister
six
wont
actually
featureâ
his
spider-man
likewise
what
big
name
actors
are
gong
to
be
recruited
to
fill
the
sinister
six
roster
that
already
includes
rhino
paul
giamatti
and
the
harry
osborn
green
goblin
dane
dehaan
not
to
mention
potentially
felicity
jones
as
felicia
hardyblack
cat
while
jamie
foxx
as
electro
remains
a
slight
possibility
and
how
will
theâ
turnout
for
a
wild
bunch-style
movie
with
spider-man
villains
compare
to
other
spider-man
films
especiallyâ
given
that
the
moviegoing
public
has
shownâ
signs
of
spidey
fatigue
of
late
not
to
mention
theres
still
thatâ
venom
movie
waiting
in
the
wingsâ
the
sustainability
of
a
spider-man
shared
universe
is
questionable
to
say
the
least
.
having
said
all
that
the
good
news
is
that
releasing
sinister
six
before
amazing
spider-man
3
frees
up
the
latter
from
having
to
devote
too
much
of
its
running
time
to
world-building
a
la
theâ
amazing
spider-man
2
.
plus
marvel
studios
left
the
may
2018
frameâ
open
for
sonys
next
amazing
spider-man
installment
which
means
that
webbs
film
will
have
more
time
to
develop
fewer
larger
franchise
duties
to
fulfill
and
less
direct
competition
to
face
at
the
box
office
.
sinister
six
opens
in
u.s.
theaters
on
november
11th
2016
.
the
amazing
spider-man
3
is
arriving
in
2018
presumably
on
the
may
4th
2018

everybody
hates

not
because
of
the
film
itself
which
for
me
and
a
lot
of
people
was
great
but
because
of
gwen
dying
.
but
people
and
especially
fan
girls
dont
seem
to
get
it
.
these
films
are
comics
based
you
cant
change
the
story
it
is
what
it
is
and
you
follow
it
as
closely
as
possible
so
you
attract
the

to
come

people
dont
like
it
because
the
story
was
overstuffed
and
the
other
characters
severely
undeveloped
.
thats
what
happens
when
you
have
multiple
villains
that
arent
really
working
towards
the
same
goal
.

alex

if
you
think
this
film
is
overstuffed
then
you
should
stick
to
watching
transformers
films
.
really
too
many
villains
rhino
barely
counts
so
that
leaves
it
with
two

and
both
of
are
good
well
developed
characters

thank
you
someone
smart
enough
to
answer
.
overstuffed
villains
are
such
an
excuse
.
take
a
look
at
batman
begins
and
the
dark
knight
rises
in
bb
it
had
carmine
falcone
ras
al
ghul
and
scarecrow
.
tdkr
had
bane
talia
al
ghul
and
catwoman
villain-turned-ally
.
story
depends
on
the
theme
and
the
characters
motivations
.
reply
the
shoveler
6
months

yeah
and
dont
forget
that
scarecrow
kept
coming
back
though
in
smaller
roles
.
didnt
he
assume
the
role
of
a
judge
or
mayor
or
something
when
the
criminals
had
taken
over
the
city
in
tdkr
also
after
falcone
they
introduced
maroni
.
and
what
about
earle
rutger
hauer
trying
to
take
over
wayne
enterprises
if
they
can
count
bodyguards
and
senators
as
more
villains
in
bvs
a
guy
like
earle
should
be
counted
in
nolans
trilogy
too
.
but
the
story
made
it
all
work
.
however
i
will
agree
with
van
dyne
that
at
least
electro
was
undeveloped
.
he
became
a
bit
of
a
stereotypical
caricaturish
lonely
nerd
.

andre
6

i
agree
a
100
however
that
was
down
to
poor
direction
which
is
strictly
on
webbs
part
.
its
just
such
a
lame
excuse
to
say
ok
theres
too
many
villains
.
the
reason
the
amazing
spider-man
2
didnt
work
is
cos
harry
was
not
developed
into
a
bad
guy
right
which
is
rushed
and
is
down
to
pacing
and
character
while
most
of
the
scenes
were
taken
out
of
the
final
cut
which
included
a

reply
elton

no
offense
but
most
of
the
story
was
terrible
especially
gwens
death
.
the
only
similarity
with
her
death
in
the
comics
is
she
dies
while
peter
attempts
to
save
her
.
the
build
up
was
terrible
gwen
openly
goes
to
help
spiderman
in
the
fight
where
in
the
comics
she
is
only
going
to
see
peter
when
she
gets
kidnapped
.
her
actual
death
in
the
comics
is
shown
when
she
is
thrown
of
the
bridge
by
green
goblin
unconscious
.
and
as
she
dies
by
snapping
her
neck
by
the
whip
lash
of
the
web
spider
man
brags
about
his
powers
how
he
is
invincible
and
how
he
can
dodge
death
when
he
realises
gwen
is
dead
.
none
of
that
happens
in
the
film
.
you
cant
even
tell
how
she
dies
in
the
film
if
its
her
head
hitting
the
floor
or
what
.
even
after
her
death
the
only
consequence
is
that
peters
sad
and
does
nothing
for
half
a
year
.
in
the
comics
its
so
different
people
call
him
psycho
and
is
labelled
a
murderer
.
how
can
you
say
that
the
films
crap
because
of
the
source
when
the
source
is
barely
used
.
this
alongside
underdeveloped
characters
destroying
the
set
up
from
the
first
film
.
the
ending
doesnt
work
at
all
looking
at
it
as
a
film
and
comparing
it
to
the
comic
.
this
is
nothing
to
do
with
following
the
comics
too
much
its
down
to
poor
writing
and
not
using
the
comics
enough
.
it
should
do
much
better
considering
they
had
a
budget
of
250
million
i
hope
more
time
and
hopefully
a
better
set
of
writers
write
the
next
film
if
it
even
happens
.

ive
held
off
commenting
on
the
recent
talk
about
whats
going
to
happen
regarding
the
spider-man
franchise
mostly
because
i
couldnt
believe
sony
would
be
seriously
considering
pulling
the
plug
.
you
cant
deny
that
they
should
be
concerned
but
its
not
like
the
movie
bombed
.
even
with
a
200
million
dollar
budget
grossing
over
700
million
has
to
have
turned
a
profit
.
maybe
its
because
im
a
little
older
than
your
average
commenter
but
it
blows
my
mind
that
when
a
movie
makes
that
much
money
it
can
still
be
considered
a
disappointment
.
of
course
it
didnt
help
that
the
final
product
wasnt
that
great
but
i
dont
think
the
blame
falls
solely
on
the
filmmakers
.
the
marketing
was
awful
.
by
the
time
the
movie
was
released
it
felt
like
there
was
nothing
left
to
see
.
i
understand
trying
to
reach
as
many
viewers
as
possible
but
you
couldnt
avoid
spider-man
marketing
unless
you
cut
yourself
off
every
form
of
media
.
i
live
in
a
relatively
smaller
new
england
town
and
there
were
billboards
here
.
that
never
happens
.
seriously
never
.
so
by
the
time
the
movie
was
released
you
almost
wanted
to
not
see
it
just
as
an
f-you
to
sony
.
as
for
the
movie
itself
i
think
a
shakeup
needs
to
happen
on
the
creative
side
.
i
think
marc
webb
is
a
decent
director
but
after
2
spider-man
films
it
seems
clear
imo
that
hes
just
not
the
big-budgeted
type
.
you
should
leave
films
like
this
feeling
wowed
but
that
just
didnt
happen
here
.
also
as
its
been
said
a
million
times
already
theres
been
to
much
world
building
and
not
enough
straight
forward
storytelling
.
sony
isnt
the
only
studio
making
this
mistake
.
marvel
has
made
it
more
than
once
and
it
seems
like
wbdc
may
be
about
to
make
the
same
mistake
with
bvs
.
a
movie
any
movie
needs
a
beginning
middle
and
end
.
not
beginning
setup
middle
foreshadowing
end
and
then
a
button
scene
.
theres
no
satisfaction
from
seeing
13
of
a
story
.

the
movie
wasnt
that
overstuffed
.
they
had
a
perfectly
good
spcript
prepared
that
was
simply
brought
down
by
studio
notes
.
im
not
saying
the
original
script
was
perfect
just
that
it
allowed
for
more
character
development
.
httpas
for
me
what
i
really
found
disappointing
or
simply
weird
were
moments
like
cartoonish
dr
kafka
electros
childish
turning-evil
tantrum
not
enough
scenes
with
peter
and
harry
the
convenient
goblin
suit
barely
explained
and
just
ready
for
use
the
reaaaally
cartoonish
giamati
the
weird
electro-flipper
scene
and
last
but
not
least
the
last
scene
with
the
spidey
kid
.
it
wasnt
the
overall
story
that
bothered
me
only
those
moments
which
didnt
worsen
the
overall
story
that
much
but
that
i
found
too
childish
for
the
tone
this
movie
and
its
predecessor
first
seemed
to
lean
toward
.

really
the
only
way
i
can
see
this
movie
working
is
if
they
take
a
similar
approach
to
guardians
of
the
galaxy
with
a
group
of
anti-heroes
with
different
backgrounds
and
motives
but
all
come
together
against
a
common
enemy
possibly
spiderman
.
however
its
going
to
be
hard
to
establish
alot
of
diversity
due
to
the
setup
in
the

people
hate

why
i
am
a
hardcore
fan
of
spidey
since
the
stracinsky
and
romita
jr
series
and
have
read
all
the
previous
ones
.
the
most
important
event
of
peters
past
besides
uncle
bens
death
is
the
moment
when
green
goblin
throws
gwen
from
a
bridge
and
he
tries
to
save
her
but
it
was
to
late
.
some
say
she
broke
her
neck
she
to
the
inertia
generated
by
the
fall
and
the
web
pulling
others
say
that
green
goblin
already
killed
her
before
throwing
her
but
the
truth
is
that
peter
couldnt
save
her
and
that
pretty
much
defined
his
character
as
a
hero
.
people
who
go
and
watch
the
movie
expected
a
happy
ending
screw
them
the
movie
was
great
on
its
final
moments
and
the
death
of
gwen
was
pretty
dramatic
and
shocking
as
it
is
supposed
to
be

webb
for
giving
us
comic

that
moment
