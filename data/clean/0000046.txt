in
the
1940sâ
oxford
university
professor
c.s
.
lewis
struggled
and
fought
to
completeâ
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
.
little
did
he
know
that
his
novel
would
become
a
best
seller
lead
to
six
sequels
and
still
be
widely
read
decades
later
.
here
are
some
things
you
may
not
know
about
this
long-lived
childrenâs
classic
.
1
.
the
story
was
inspired
by
an
image
of
a
faun
.
from
age
16
onward
lewis
often
found
himself
imagining
âa
faun
carrying
an
umbrella
and
parcels
in
a
snowy
wood.â
according
to
his
short
essay
it
all
began
with
a
picture
pdf
the
image
continued
to
come
to
him
until
at
age
40
he
said
to
himself
âlet
's
try
to
make
a
story
about
it.â
2
.
the
book
was
also
inspired
by
three
girls
who
lived
with
lewis
during
world
war
ii
.
in
1939
three
girls
margaret
mary
and
katherine
were
evacuated
from
london
because
of
anticipated
bombings
and
sent
to
live
with
lewis
in
the
countryside
for
a
short
time
.
this
situation
seems
to
be
the
inspiration
for
the
four
childrenâsusan
peter
edmund
and
lucyâbeing
sent
to
live
with
the
old
professor
in
the
book
.
3
.
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
took
10
years
to
write
.
lewis
started
in
1939
and
finished
in
1949
.
the
novel
was
published
in
1950
.
4
.
the
story
was
floundering
until
lewis
invented
aslan
the
lion
.
wikimedia
commons
lewis
wasnât
sure
what
to
do
with
the
book
until
âaslan
came
bounding
into
it.â
heâd
been
having
dreams
of
lions
and
found
that
putting
aslan
in
âpulled
the
whole
story
together
and
soon
he
pulled
the
six
other
narnian
stories
in
after
him.â
incidentally
aslan
means
``
lion
''
in
turkish
.
5
.
lewis
and
j.r.r
.
tolkien
were
in
a
writing
group
called
the
inklings
.
while
both
writers
were
working
on
fantasy
novelsâlewis
on
narnia
and
tolkien
on
the
lord
of
the
ringsâthey
met
every
monday
morning
to
talk
about
writing
.
others
started
to
join
them
and
soon
the
group
swelled
to
19
men
so
they
started
meeting
on
thursday
evenings
to
share
and
discuss
their
work.â
6
.
lewis
destroyed
the
first
version
of
the
book
because
his
friends
didnât
like
it
.
before
1947
lewis
wrote
a
draft
of
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
with
four
children
named
ann
martin
rose
and
peter
.
the
reaction
of
his
friends
to
the
story
was
discouraging
to
say
the
least
.
he
said
in
a
letter
âit
was
by
the
unanimous
verdict
of
my
friends
so
bad
that
i
destroyed
it.â
7
.
lucy
is
a
real
person
.
owenbarfield.org
lucy
is
based
on
lucy
barfield
lewisâs
goddaughter
and
the
daughter
of
owen
barfield
.
she
was
4
years
old
when
he
started
the
book
and
14
when
he
finished
it
.
in
the
dedication
to
lucy
he
said
âsomeday
you
will
be
old
enough
to
start
reading
fairy
tales
again
.
you
can
then
take
it
down
from
some
upper
shelf
dust
it
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
it.â
8
.
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
is
a
âmagical
doorwayâ
story
.
as
the
term
suggests
this
is
a
story
where
a
door
or
other
opening
allows
a
character
to
leave
the
real
world
and
enter
a
magical
world
.
other
magical
doorways
include
the
rabbit
hole
that
alice
falls
down
in
alice
's
adventures
in
wonderland
and
platform
9
34
in
the
harry
potter
series
.
9
.
the
book
is
also
a
christian
allegoryâor
is
it
the
christian
themes
in
the
story
are
overt
.
aslan
as
a
stand-in
for
christ
allows
himself
to
be
sacrificed
by
the
evil
white
witch
and
is
then
resurrected
which
brings
salvation
to
narnia
.
this
follows
christâs
death
on
the
cross
and
his
resurrection
three
days
later
.
but
in
a
1962
letter
lewis
said
the
book
was
not
an
allegory
so
much
as
a
âsupposalâ
as
in
âsuppose
there
were
a
narnian
world
and
it
like
ours
needed
redemption
.
what
kind
of
incarnation
and
passion
might
christ
be
supposed
to
undergo
thereâ
10
.
lewis
jumbled
all
kinds
of
mythology
into
the
book
.
narnia
draws
on
greek
roman
and
norse
mythology
irish
and
british
fairy
tales
germanic
folklore
and
arthurian
romance
just
to
name
a
few
.
even
santa
claus
makes
an
appearance
.
11
.
the
white
witch
is
based
on
the
snow
queen
by
hans
christian
andersen
.
wikimedia
commons
like
the
snow
queen
the
white
witch
is
a
tall
woman
dressed
in
white
who
is
capable
of
freezing
peopleâthe
snow
queen
turns
their
hearts
to
ice
and
the
white
witch
turns
people
to
stone
.
both
women
bring
a
boy
onto
a
sled
and
destroy
him
emotionally
through
evil
magic
.
12
.
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
is
chronologically
the
second
book
in
the
narnia
series.â
while
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
was
written
first
the
magicianâs
nephew
is
chronologically
where
the
story
starts
.
many
people
read
the
magicianâs
nephew
first
so
they
can
go
from
the
earliest
to
the
latest
point
in
the
series
.
13
.
professor
kirke
was
based
on
lewisâs
high
school
tutor
.
the
professor
whose
name
is
digory
kirke
is
based
on
william
t.
kirkpatrick
who
tutored
lewis
when
he
was
a
teenager
.
along
with
appearing
in
the
first
book
the
professor
is
the
protagonist
of
the
magicianâs
nephew
and
also
appears
in
the
last
battle
.
14
.
tolkien
didnât
like
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
.
in
1949
lewis
read
a
completed
manuscript
of
the
book
to
tolkien
and
was
surprised
by
his
negative
reaction
.
thereâs
much
speculation
as
to
why
he
disliked
the
book
so
much
.
some
say
itâs
because
tolkien
didnât
like
how
lewis
mixed
different
mythologies
together
.
another
theory
is
that
tolkien
was
threatened
by
the
speed
with
which
lewis
assembled
his
world
when
tolkien
was
so
meticulous
in
his
invention
of
middle-earth
.
the
truth
is
we
may
never
know
the
details
.
tolkien
said
in
a
letter
``
it
is
sad
that
'narnia
'
and
all
that
part
of
c.s.l
.
's
work
should
remain
outside
the
range
of
my
sympathy
as
much
of
my
work
was
outside
his.â
which
tells
us
almost
nothing
.
15
.
it
's
one
of
the
best-selling
books
of
all
time
.
itâs
difficult
to
rank
all-time
best-selling
books
but
when
people
try
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
is
usually
on
the
list
.
for
example
itâs
number
6
on
this
list
number
9
on
this
list
and
number
17
on
this
list
.
in
any
case
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
is
ridiculously
successful
.
it
has
been
translated
to
47
languages
and
adapted
for
tv
stage
radio
and
the
silver
screen
.
in
2005
it
was
made
into
a
big-budget
movie
starring
tilda
swinton
and
james
mcavoy
.
