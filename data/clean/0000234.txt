storyline
peter
parker
has
finally
managed
to
piece
together
the
once-broken
parts
of
his
life
maintaining
a
balance
between
his
relationship
with
mary-jane
and
his
responsibility
as
spider-man
.
but
more
challenges
arise
for
our
young
hero
.
peter
's
old
friend
harry
obsourne
has
set
out
for
revenge
against
peter
taking
up
the
mantle
of
his
late
father
's
persona
as
the
new
goblin
and
peter
must
also
capture
uncle
ben
's
real
killer
flint
marko
who
has
been
transformed
into
his
toughest
foe
yet
the
sandman
.
all
hope
seems
lost
when
suddenly
peter
's
suit
turns
jet-black
and
greatly
amplifies
his
powers
.
but
it
also
begins
to
greatly
amplify
the
much
darker
qualities
of
peter
's
personality
that
he
begins
to
lose
himself
to
.
peter
has
to
reach
deep
inside
himself
to
free
the
compassionate
hero
he
used
to
be
if
he
is
to
ever
conquer
the
darkness
within
and
face
not
only
his
greatest
enemies
but
also
...
himself

reviews
my
feelings
after
watching
the
third
film
are
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
satisfied
but
that
feeling
is
fairly
disappointing
.
satisfied
more
or
less
means
adequate
and
to
follow
a
sequel
that
i
consider
excellent
with
a
film
that
's
only
adequate
is
a
certainly
a
step
down
.
positively
spider-man
3
does
reasonably
well
at
maintaining
a
feeling
similar
to
that
of
the
first
two
films
.
i
never
felt
like
i
was
n't
seeing
the
same
world
or
characters
and
that
's
important
to
me
.
continuity
in
tone
really
helps
hold
a
series
together
.
the
matrix
reloaded
never
felt
to
me
like
i
was
witnessing
the
continuation
of
the
story
and
world
presented
in
the
first
installment
.
the
scenery
and
characters
felt
like
weak
and
dull
recreations
and
that
really
bugged
me
.
the
new-york
of
spider-man
3
is
about
the
same
as
before
as
is
peter
's
apartment
the
daily
bugle
offices
etc
.
peter
harry
mary
jane
aunt
may
etc
.
also
carry
over
well
and
it
's
easy
to
jump
back
into
their
lives
.
where
it
does
n't
feel
like
its
predecessors
is
in
its
pacing
and
scope
.
the
film
tries
to
tell
a
lot
of
story
for
one
film
much
more
than
either
the
previous
installments
.
this
makes
it
messy
.
if
you
took
spider-man
1
and
2
's
stories
wove
them
together
and
compressed
them
into
one
2
hour
film
you
'd
have
a
mess
pretty
similar
to
spider-man
3
.
a
lot
of
this
has
to
do
with
poor
exposition
and
the
decision
to
include
three
villains
.
in
good
exposition
events
lead
to
other
events
and
it
all
seems
to
flow
naturally
.
some
films
end
up
feeling
like
a
story
was
n't
really
even
written
but
instead
a
series
of
well-crafted
scenes
that
do
n't
necessarily
fit
well
together
.
a
bunch
of
smaller
scenes
are
then
written
to
connect
those
scenes
.
these
scenes
can
feel
very
forced
because
they
often
rely
heavily
on
coincidence
.
the
matrix
reloaded
is
full
of
these
contrived
scenes
and
so
is
spider-man
3
.
they
're
frustrating
because
they
act
like
speed
bumps
where
the
plot
suddenly
feels
awkward
and
my
enjoyment
of
the
film
drops
.
one
scene
sticks
out
particularly
in
spider-man
3
as
too
awkward
.
venom
one
of
the
super-villains
is
swinging
through
alleyways
when
he
is
ambushed
by
the
sandman
another
villain
.
venom
proposes
they
team
to
get
spider-man
together
sandman
agrees
end
scene
.
this
scene
is
needed
to
set
up
the
final
huge
battle
of
the
film
but
just
seems
poorly
worked
in
.
for
one
it
's
very
short
and
two
the
characters
do
n't
know
each
other
and
have
completely
different
motives
for
being
villains
.
that
the
two
would
decide
that
quickly
to
become
partners
after
coincidentally
running
into
each
other
is
just
sloppy
to
watch.despite
how
it
seems
i
did
n't
hate
the
film
.
i
was
just
disappointed
in
its
flow
as
a
narrative
and
thought
it
aimed
much
higher
than
it
should
have
in
terms
of
what
to
include
plot
wise
.
regardless
though
many
scenes
were
very
enjoyable
to
watch
and
i
do
n't
just
mean
action
scenes
.
the
daily
bugle
scenes
as
always
were
great
and
funny
.
the
addition
of
topher
grace
as
peter
's
photographer
rival
eddie
brock
was
great
casting
.
his
line
delivery
works
perfectly
with
his
character
's
sleazy
personality
and
his
scenes
with
peter
are
some
of
the
best
.
the
character
harry
osborne
returns
and
becomes
one
of
the
film
's
three
villains
a
new
green
goblin
that
takes
over
where
the
goblin
of
the
first
film
left
off
.
harry
and
peter
's
relationship
is
probably
the
most
interesting
part
of
the
story
.
their
struggle
between
being
friends
and
enemies
makes
for
some
tense
moments
.
one
of
my
favorite
scenes
in
the
film
is
a
verbal
confrontation
in
a
diner
between
peter
and
harry
.
playing
off
peter
's
presumption
that
he
and
harry
are
back
on
good
terms
harry
orchestrates
a
bit
of
nasty
drama
that
sticks
a
knife
in
pete
's
love
life
.
he
has
peter
meet
him
in
a
diner
just
to
drive
the
knife
in
a
little
further
.
as
pete
storms
out
harry
is
awash
in
sadistic
joy
with
himself
before
making
a
fast
and
creepy
exit
.
harry
is
really
the
best
handled
villain
of
the
film
.
not
only
as
the
green
goblin
jr.
fighting
spider-man
in
the
sky
much
the
way
his
father
did
but
as
harry
peter
's
estranged
friend
using
their
friendship
as
a
pretty
sharp
weapon
against
him
.
the
villain
i
could
have
done
without
was
the
sandman
.
his
character
was
interesting
but
his
place
in
the
film
as
a
main
character
seemed
unnecessary
and
forced
.
he
's
an
escaped
convict
running
from
the
police
who
accidentally
falls
into
a
big
science
experiment
and
becomes
the
sandman
.
he
is
also
apparently
the
actual
killer
of
peter
's
uncle
ben
thus
giving
peter
motivation
to
go
after
him
.
this
reworking
of
the
first
film
's
story
seems
very
far
fetched
and
unnecessary
.
the
computer
effects
used
to
create
sandman
are
terrific
as
is
the
performance
by
thomas
hayden-church
but
i
think
the
film
would
have
improved
without
him
.
more
time
could
then
have
been
given
to
the
conflicts
with
harry
and
eddie
and
likewise
goblin
and
venom
.
venom
is
particularly
nice
because
he
's
the
only
villain
not
the
product
of
some
crazy
experiment
gone
wrong
.
his
creation
is
almost
entirely
peter
's
fault
.
venom
acts
as
a
slimy
toothy
grinning
anti-spider-man
who
hates
spider-man
on
a
personal
level
after
eddie
brock
loses
his
job
and
girlfriend
and
holds
peter
responsible
.
two
villains
definitely
would
've
been
enough
for
one
film
especially
two
villains
that
feel
wronged
by
peter
personally
not
just
peter
as
spider-man
.
i
do
n't
really
want
them
to
continue
this
series
but
since
it
seems
like
they
may
anyway
i
hope
some
lesson
is
learned
with
number
three
that
less
really
can
be
more
.
if
the
time
that
was
spent
awkwardly
packing
too
many
stories
into
one
film
was
instead
spent
working
on
one
good
story
so
that
it
flowed
naturally
spider-man
3
could
have
excelled
the
way
number
two
did
.
