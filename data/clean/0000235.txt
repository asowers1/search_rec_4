it
really
sucks
that
they
did
n't
introduce
venom
until
the
end
of
the
movie
and
then
killed
him
off
.
â
they
should
have
left
the
sandman
out
of
the
movie
so
they
could
have
focused
more
on
venom
.

there
is
one
unexpected
death
of
one

you
are
an
idiot
cause
tobey
maguire
is
great
actor
and
i
miss
him
being
spidey
...
marvel
should
release
spider-man
reboot
but
after
they
should
make
spider-man

with
tobey
cause
he
is
the
one
and
real
spider-man
and
he
always

be

toby
fit
the
peter
parker
role
perfectly
.
the
way
the
directorâ
and
the
script
had
him
act
was
the
problem
.
spiderman
2
was
and
still
is
by
far
an
amazing
spiderman
film
and
captured
the
webhead
at
his
best
.
