a
brief

of

was
a
massive
bestseller
too
as
far
back
as
the
late-1980sâthough
the
foreword
from
then-superstar
carl
sagan
must
have
helped
.
but
do
you
personally
know
anyone
who
has
actually
read
these
books
cover-to-cover
not
too
many
people

suspect

which
makes
the
success
of
umberto
ecoâs
the
name
of
the
rose
celebrating
30
years
in
translation
this
year
even
more
remarkable
.
sure
it
had
been
a
success
in
europe
but
the
year
was
1980
and
the
world
was
a
lot
bigger
then
â
and
communication
was
no
mere
email
away
.
and
the
craziest
thing
about
this
maddening
book
people
not
only
bought
it
but
read
it
â
and
tried
to
âunderstandâ
it
.
it
produced
if
not
a
cottage
industry
exactly
some
excellent
ancillary
material
such
as
the
indispensable
the
key
to
âthe
name
of
the
roseâ
including
translations
of
all
non-english
passages

and
a
nearly
x-rated
frano-german
movie

featuring
a
panoply
of
stars
such
as
sean
connery
f.

abraham
a
very
young
christian
slater
a
very
old
bill
hickey
ron
perlman
and
michael
lonsdale
who
recently
reprised
his
role
as
a
monk
in
of
gods
and
men
.
perhaps
most
importantly
it
also
gave
birth
to
ecoâs
own
delightful
84-page
postscript
to
the
name
of
the
rose
.
m.d
.
herter-norton
once
wrote
that
âa
translator
must
do
his
very
best
â
and
then
apologize
for
doing
it
at
all
.
that
caveat
duly
noted
umberto
eco
had
âthe
dean
of
italian
translatorsâ
to
help
make
this
insane
book
a
success
william
weaverâs
english-translation
is
surely
one
of
the
best
examples
of
losing
nothing
in
translation
.
still
in
fairness
to
weaver
thereâs
much
of
the
book
â
all
500
pages
of
it
â
that
is
not
translated
or
even
footnoted
.
and
why
wait
for
the
âbookâ
itself
in
his
completely
fictive
and
entertaining
preface
to
the

who
would
read
such
a
book
and
why
as
for
the
âwhyâ
the
easy
answer
from
a
professor
of
literature
i
admire
is
that
book
is
and
i
guess
i
am
obliged
to
state
here
âspoiler
alertâ
âitâs
essentially
sherlock
holmes
in
a
monasteryâwith
a
sex-scene
.
heâs
not
totally
wrongâbut
thatâs
only
part
of
the
book
.
a
very
small
part
.
eco
who
is
a
bona-fide
genius
but
also
a
show-off
of
the
worst
james-joyce-wanna-be-sort
was
also
it
should
be
remembered
a
debut
novelist
all
his
previous
books
had
been
on
semiotics
the
study
of
signs
literary
theory
and
criticism
and
other
academic
treatisesâand
oddly
a
couple
of
childrenâs
books
.
worse
from
a
publisher
and
editorâs
point
of
view
eco
purposefully
made
the
first
100
pages
of
the
book
particularly
difficult
.
âmy
friends
and
editors
suggested
i
abbreviate
the
first
hundred
pages
which
they
found
very
difficult
and
demanding
.
without
thinking
twice
i
refused
because
as
i
insisted
if
somebody
wanted
to
enter
the
abbey
and
live
there
for
seven
days
he
had
to
accept
the
abbeyâs
own
pace
.
if
he
could
not
he
would
never
manage
to
read
the
whole
book
.
therefore
those
first
hundred
pages
are
like
a
penance
or
initiation
and
if
someone
does
not
like
them
so
much
the
worse
for
him
.
he
can
stay
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain.â

fine
and
good
all
that
but
not
even
half-way
up
that
mountain
of
100-pages
is

as
for
âwhoâ
would
read
this
book
my
father
who
is
the
smartest
man
iâve
met
was
undeterred
by
this
book
.
he
would
never
allow
cable
tv
in
his
house
and
still
doesnât
but
must
have
shelled
out
a
couple
of
monthsâ
salary
to
buy
the
full-blown
twenty-one
volume
encyclopedia
brittanica
along
with
the
ten
volume
annals
of
america
but
most
importantly
the
seven-language
dictionary
in
three
over-sized
volumes
with
the
obligatory
magnifying
glass
.
he
regularly
worked
double-digit
hours
in
his
bakery
six
days
a
week
but
when
it
was
time
to
read
the
name
of
the
rose
he
sat
propped
up
in
bed
reading
glasses
on
the
tip
of
his
nose
and
at
least
six
volumes
of
the
encyclopedia
around
him
and
on
top
of
my
sleeping
mother
as
a
type
of
blanket
.
once
when
walking
by
their
bedroom
i
heard
him
mutter
âcanât
this
guy
write
one
page
without
a
word
i
donât
have
to
look
upâ
and
at
the
bakery
my
uncles
who
shared
my
fatherâs
penchant
for
late
night
reading
also
discussed
the
difficulty
of
the
novel
â
and
all
were
relieved
when
the
movie
came
out
âi
can
finally
see
the
place
heâs
describing
my
uncle
skip
announced
.
if
the
words
themselves
werenât
enough
to
deter
an
audience
the
references
should
have
turned
away
an
array
of
readers
hereâs
three

from
page

celestine
v
was
succeeded
by
boniface
viii
and
this
pope
promptly
demonstrated
scant
indulgence
for
spirituals
and
fraticelli
in
general
in
the
last
years
of
the
dying
century
he
signed
a
bull
firma
cautela
in
which
with
one
stroke
he
condemned
bizochi
vagabond
mendicants
who
roamed
about
at
the
far
edge
of
the
franciscan
order
and
the
spirituals
themselves
who
had
left
the
life
of
the
order
and
retired
to
a
hermitage
.
after
the
death
of
boniface
viii
the
spirituals
tried
to
obtain
from
certain
of
his
successors
among
them
clement
v
permission
to
leave
the
order
peaceably
.
i
believe
they
would
have
succeeded
but
the
advent
of
john
xxii
robbed
them
of
all
hope
.
when
he
was
elected
in
1316
he
wrote
to
the
king
of
sicily
telling
him
to
expel
those
monks
from
his
lands
where
many
had
taken
refuge
and
john
had
angelus
clarenus
and
the
spirituals
of
provence
put
in
chains
.
all
can
not
have
proceeded
smoothly
and
many
in
the
curia
resisted
.
the
fact
is
that
ubertino
and
clarenus
managed
to
obtain
permission
to
leave
the
order
and
the
former
was
received
by
the
benedictines
the
latter
by
the
celestinians
.
but
for
those
who
continued
to
lead
their
free
life
john
was
merciless
and
he
had
them
persecuted
by
the
inquisition
and
many
were
burned
at
the
stake
.
unless
you
are
a
medievalist
with
a
working
knowledge
of
the
politics
of
the
papacy
the
above
is
almost
as
impenetrable
as
the
abbeyâs
labyrinthine
library
.
and
still
people
bought
â
and
read
â
and
struggled
with
this
book
.
eco
himself
has
said
that
the
book
is
âsimplyâ
a
âwhodunitâ
and
that
is
again
a
big
part
of
its
appeal
who
is
killing
these
poor
monks
a
more
sane
reader
might
answer
âwho
cares
i
canât
read
latin
which
get
ready
for
this
is
the
language
of
the
final
lines
of
the
book
and
donât
know
anything
about
14th-century
italian
church
politics.â
still
millions
and
millions
read
on
.
and
ultimately
the
book
does
not
disappoint
.
indeed
it
dazzles
.
if
ever
there
was
a
tour
de
force
performance
by
a
first-time
novelist
who
created
a
literary
and
popular
hitâmake
that
a
âcraze
given
that
the
book
spawned
not
only
a
movie
but
a
board-
and
video-gameâthis
was
it
.
and
that
was
it
all
of
ecoâs
novels
that
followed
â
with
the
very
wide-berth
possible
exception
of
foucaultâs
pendulumâ
â
have
been
critically
if
only
politely
well-received
but
widely
unread
do
you
know
a
soul
who
has
bothered
to
read
baudolino
or
the
ponderous
the
mysterious
flame
of
queen
loana
even
the
recent
the
prague
cemetery
disappoints
.
which
leads
to
an
obvious
question
why
didnât
and
why
doesnât
eco
simply
write
the
sequel
to
the
name
of
the
rose
like
sherlock
holmes
the
book
almost
begs
to
be
written
the
protagonists
brother
william
of
baskerville
and
frater
adso
of
melk
travel
together
on
a
crusade
.
or
brother
william
re-joins
the
inquisition
.
or
both
are
called
to
rome
to
assist
the
pope
in
some
urgent
matter
pressing
upon
christendom
.
no
matter
.
we
may
never
get
the
sequel
.
but
re-reading
the
name
of
the
rose
is
one
of
the
pleasures
that
never
disappoints
even
a
generation
after
it
first
appeared
.
