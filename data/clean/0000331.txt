were
betting
this
is
the
secondâ
sentence
youll
read
after
first
scrolling
down
to
see
what
we
picked
for
our
1
track
.
and
chances
are
youâre
not
going
to
be
surprised
by
what
you
see
.
for
as
much
as
fans
tout
the
album
experience
when
it
comes
to
classic
rock
bands
the
simple
fact
isâ
queen
will
best
be
remembered
for
their
hit
singles
.
thatâs
the
reason
that
compilations
of
their
biggest
hits
regularly
sell
into
the
millions
.
and
the
reason
that
the
tracks
that
wound
up
in
the
top
20
of
this
list
are
in
regular
rotation
on
radio
stations
around
the
world
.
those
are
the
tunes
that
inspired
thousands
of
soccer
game
chants
lusty
karaoke
bar
renditions
and
road
trip
singalongs
.
things
get
challenging
when
we
go
beyond
the
top
20
.
every
one
of
the
167
songs
listed
here
have
something
to
get
excited
about
be
it
a
great
guitar
solo
a
soaring
freddie
mercury
vocal
turn
or
someâ
little
detail
that
makes
the
hairs
on
the
back
of
your
neck
stand
up
.
the
tunes
that
ranked
higher
are
the
ones
either
packed
with
those
moments
or
feature
enough
of
these
littleâ
details
to
draw
you
in
.
that
can
be
anything
from
listening
to
the
band
charmingly
botch
a
tribute
to
southern
boogie
rock
âsleeping

sidewalkâ
the
push-pull
of
brian
mayâs

with
the
stomp
of
roger
taylorâs
drums

or
freddie
doing
his
best
soul
diva
over
a
wash
of
slinky
synthpop
âpain
is
so
close
to
pleasureâ
.
the
songs
on
the
bottom
of
this
list
generally
have
at
least
something
going
for
them
.
but
they
are
also
the
ones
that
drive
one-note
ideas
into
the
ground
jaunty
music-hall
tributes
and
sound
like
the
bandâs
heart
just
wasnât
in
it
.
that
the
bottom
three
tracks
were
all
b-sides
should
give
you
some
indication
of
where
even
the
band
thought
they
ranked
.
no
matter
what
order
these
tracks
are
listed
queen

dominated
the
commercial

artistic
landscape
for

40
years
after
the

fact

your
morning
run
off
or
to
at
least
help
you
get
your
day
started
with
a
bang
instead
of
a
whimper
i
can
think
of
nothing
better
than
this
inspiring
and
anthemic
little
number
from
queenâs
1986
album
a
kind
of
magic
.
10
.
we
will
rock
you
news
of
the
world
1977
rock
at
its
most
minimalist
and
the
song
that
launched
a
million
crowd
pump
up
moments
in
sports
arenas
.
this
is
the
kind
of
song
that
is
baked
into
the
dna
of
every
person
on
the
planet
likely
able
to
conjure
up
the
âstomp
stomp
clapâ
beat
at
will
.
the
ubiquity
of
âwe
will
rock
youâ
doesnât
diminish
its
greatness
of
course
.
its
perfection
is
due
to
its
simplicity
the
three
count
rhythm
the
chanted
lyrics
that
you
will
remember
until
your
dying
day
and
brian
may
streaking
through
the
mix
with
a
guitar
solo
for
the
ages
.
donât
fight
it
friends
just
stomp
your
feet
clap
your
hands
and
shout
that
chorus
like
your
life
depends
on
it
.

the
show
must
go
on
innuendo
1991
the
most
defiant
and
heartbreaking
song
that
the
band
wrote
for
the
last
album
they
completed
together
before
freddie
mercuryâs
death
in
1991
.
the
track
written
primarily
by
brian
may
was
a
fist-pumping
tribute
to
mercuryâs
efforts
to
stay
creatively
active
even
as
complications
from
his
aids
infection
were
destroying
his
body
.
as
the
queen
guitarist
told
rolling
stone
the
singer
could
barely
walk
when
he
got
into
the
studio
to
record
it
but
was
able
to
put
his
all
into
this
triumphal
anthem
.
you
hear
this
song
and
you
expect
to
see
fireworks
and
pyrotechnics
blasting
through
the
sky
.

somebody
to
love
a
day
at
the
races
1976
almost
a
companion
piece
to
âbohemian
rhapsodyâ
this
1976
single
is
all
about
the
dense
gospel
harmonies
of
freddie
mercury
brian
may
and
roger
taylor
.
that
gorgeous
bit
of
give-and-take
between
the
choir
and
mercuryâs
urgent
pleas
for
romance
in
return
for
all
of
his
hard
work
and
good
deeds
is
the
songâs
sturdy
anchor
.
buoyed
by
that
may
aims
for
the
stratosphere
with
his
ringing
solos
and
taylor
nimbly
dances
around
the
beat
.
the
song
has
had
a
long
afterlife
popping
up
in
film
soundtracks
tv
shows
like
glee
and
being
covered
by
everyone
from
italian
diva
mia
martini
to
punk
rocker
frank

written
by
freddie
mercury
as
an
expression
of
his
apparent
lust
for
the
bandâs
radio
promotions
man
at
the
time
it
found
the
band
stepping
firmly
outside
the
multi-tiered
prog
of
their
first
two
albums
with
a
jaunty
piano
line
a
perfectly
placed
bit
of
phase
effects
on
the
line
âdynamite
with
a
laser
beamâ
and
one
of
brian
mayâs
best
solos
.
it
proved
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
for
the
bandâs
commercial
prospects
as
well
.
the
1974
single
was
a
sizable
international
hit
landing
in
the
top
20
here
in
the
u.s.
and
just
missing

on

what
better
way
to
kick
off
an
album
in
this
case
1976âs
a
day
at
the
races
than
a
vicious
rocker
with
a
guitar
riff
that
explodes
the
blues
tradition
with
one
jagged
blow
the
song
itself
is
a
simple
one
expressing
every
teenage
boyâs
desire
to
get
the
folks
out
of
the
way
so
he
and
his
lady
can
fool
around
.
but
in
the
hands
of
brian
may
who
wrote
the
tune
in
becomes
particularly
urgent
and
heated
all
the
better
to
match
the
âboiling
up
insideâ
that
the
protagonist
is
feeling
.
the
song
wasnât
a
huge
chart
success
but
it
has
long
been
a
fan
favorite
thanks
to
queen
including
it
in
the
set
list
of
almost
every
show
they
played
from
1976
until
freddie
mercuryâs
passing
in
1991

though
he
was
the
least-flamboyant
member
of
queen
john
deacon
was
actually
the
most
versatile
and
funkiest
songwriter
in
the
group
.
if
you
need
proof
look
no
further
than
this
raw
and
ready
anthem
.
apparently
inspired
by
some
time
that
deacon
spent
with
disco
titans
chic
the
rubbery
bass
groove
psychedelic
tape
effects
and
in
your
face
lyrics
proved
infectious
for
audiences
around

.
it
had
a
particular
pull
here
in
the
states
where
the
song
hit

on
the
billboard
charts
while
also
finding
crossover
success
on
soul
radio
stations
and
in
dance
clubs
.
like
a
lot
of
queenâs
best
work
the
song
has
been
remixed
and
covered
and
recycled
in
a
myriad
of
ways
since
its
1980
release

best
friend

night
at

opera

on
their
fourth
album
a
night
at
the
opera
queen
proved
capable
of
handling
most
any
style
of
popular
music
including
as
this
song
bears
out
the
three-minute
pop
song
.
this
could
be
the
sweetest
song
in
the
bandâs
canon
written
as
it
was
by
bassist
john
deacon
for
his
wife
and
featuring
some
of
the
most
baldly
romantic
lyrics
freddie
mercury
has
ever
sung
.
the
key
to
the
song
though
is
that
wonderfully
incessant
electric
piano
line
that
starts
it
off
.
itâs
a
strangely
delicate
touch
that
forces
the
rest
of
the
band
to
play
with
a
much
lighter
touch
than
ever
before
.

under
pressure

space
1982
one
of
the
greatest
rock
duets
ever
recorded
this
is
a
quintessential
moment
from
the
latter
part
of
queenâs
career
where
they
were
able
to
mesh
their
dramatics
with
a
tight
danceable
groove
.
like
many
great
songs
the
initial
demos
tell
an
interesting
story
with
the
band
kicking
around
a
stately
formless
blues
chug
.
but
when
david
bowie
visited
the
band
in
their
swiss
studio
the
five
men
took
this
blueprint
locked
horns
and
turned
out
this
little
masterpiece
in
the
span
of
an
evening
.
there
are
so
many
hooks
packed
in
to
âunder
pressureâ
but
none
better
than
that
simple
infectious
three-note
bass
line
created
by
john
deacon
that
kicks
things
off
.
if
hearing
it
doesnât
send
an
electric
charge
up
your
spine
you
might
be
dead

it
freddie
mercury
wrote
this
tribute
to
elvis
presley
in
about
10
minutes
during
the
off-hours
of
the
bandâs
long
recording
sessions
for
their
eighth
album
the
game
.
and
a
few
hours
after
presenting
it
to
the
rest
of
the
band
they
knocked
together
the
version
that
brought
queen

first

no

1
single
and
one
of
the
greatest
songs
to
ever
to
clock
in
at
less
than
three
minutes
.
it
may
seem
a
slight
song
compared
with
the
rest
of
the
bandâs
catalog
but
next
time
youâre
at
a
bar
dial

up

rhapsody

could

other
song
no

track
best
encapsulates
the
volatile
mixture
of
glam
and
prog
that
made
queen
so
absolutely
amazing
.
every
last
second
of
this
nearly
six-minute
long
epic
feels
absolutely
essential
.
the
tightly
wound
multi-tracked
harmonies
by
freddie
mercury
brian
may
and
roger
taylor
dominating
the
operatic
middle
section
and
making
the
nonsensical
barrage
of
fandangos
and
bismillahs
sound
downright
badass
.
mercuryâs
stirring
lead
vocals
that
jump
from
withered
pleas
to
bombastic
yelps
and
back
again
.
mayâs
guitar
solos
piercing
through
the
mist
like
a
lightsaber
.
take
away
one
element
and
the
song
would
be
the
lesser
for
it
.
if
every
other
queen
song
were
wiped
out
of
existence
and
this
one
remained
we
would
still
be
talking
about
the
greatness
of
these
four
lads
