someone
was
digging
a
grave
in
one
corner
of
the
cemetery
as
i
went
in
through
the
lychgate
.
i
remember
that
quite
clearly
because
it
seemed
to
set
the
scene
for
nearly
everything
that
followed
.
five
or
six
rooks
lifted
out
of
the
beech
trees
at
the
west
end
of
the
church
like
bundles
of
black
rags
calling
angrily
to
each
other
as
i
threaded
my
way
between
the
tombstones
and
approached
the
grave
turning
up
the
collar
of
my
trenchcoat
against
the
driving
rain
.
whoever
was
down
there
was
talking
to
himself
in
a
low
voice
.
it
was
impossible
to
catch
what
he
was
saying
.
i
moved
to
one
side
of
the
pile
of
fresh
earth
dodging
another
spadeful
and
peered
in
.
'nasty
morning
for
it
.
'
he
looked
up
resting
on
his
spade
an
old
old
man
in
a
cloth
cap
and
shabby
mud-
stained
suit
a
grain
sack
draped
across
his
shoulders
.
his
cheeks
were
sunken
and
hollow
covered
with
a
grey
stubble
and
his
eyes
full
of
moisture
and
quite
vacant
.
i
tried
again
.
'the
rain
'
i
said
.
some
kind
of
understanding
dawned
.
he
glanced
up
at
the
sombre
sky
and
scratched
his
chin
.
'worse
before
it
gets
better
i
'd
say
.
'
'it
must
make
it
difficult
for
you
'
i
said
.
there
was
at
least
six
inches
of
water
swilling
about
in
the
bottom
.
he
poked
at
the
far
side
of
the
grave
with
his
spade
and
it
split
wide
open
like
something
rotten
bursting
earth
showering
down
.
'could
be
worse
.
they
put
so
many
in
this
little
boneyard
over
the
years
people
are
n't
planted
in
earth
any
more
.
they
're
buried
in
human
remains
.
'
he
laughed
exposing
toothless
gums
then
bent
down
scrabbled
in
the
earth
at
his
feet
and
held
up
a
finger-bone
.
'see
what
i
mean'
the
appeal
even
for
the
professional
writer
of
life
in
all
its
infinite
variety
definitely
has
its
limits
on
occasion
and
i
decided
it
was
time
to
move
on
.
'i
have
got
it
right
this
is
a
catholic
church'
'all
romans
here
'
he
said
.
'always
have
been
.
'
'then
maybe
you
can
help
me
.
i
'm
looking
for
a
grave
or
perhaps
even
a
monument
inside
the
church
.
gascoigneâcharles
gascoigne
.
a
sea
captain
.
'
'never
heard
of
him
'
he
said
.
'and
i
've
been
sexton
here
forty-one
years
.
when
was
he
buried'
'around
sixteen-eighty-five
.
'
his
expression
did
n't
alter
.
he
said
calmly
'ah
well
then
before
my
time
you
see
.
father
verekerânow
he
might
know
something
.
'
'will
he
be
inside'
'there
or
the
presbytery
.
other
side
of
the
trees
behind
the
wall
.
'
at
that
moment
for
some
reason
or
other
the
rookery
in
the
beech
trees
above
our
heads
erupted
into
life
dozens
of
rooks
wheeling
in
the
rain
filling
the
air
with
their
clamour
.
the
old
man
glanced
up
and
hurled
the
finger-bone
into
the
branches
.
and
then
he
said
a
very
strange
thing
.
'noisy
bastards
'
he
called
.
'get
back
to
leningrad
.
'
i
'd
been
about
to
turn
away
but
paused
intrigued
.
'leningrad
'
i
said
.
'what
makes
you
say
that'
''
that
's
where
they
come
from
.
starlings
too
.
they
've
been
ringed
in
leningrad
and
they
turn
up
here
in
october
.
too
cold
for
them
over
there
in
the
winter
.
'
'is
that
so
'
i
said
.
he
had
become
quite
animated
now
took
half
a
cigarette
from
behind
his
ear
and
stuck
it
in
his
mouth
.
'cold
enough
to
freeze
the
balls
off
a
brass
monkey
over
there
in
the
winter
.
a
lot
of
germans
died
at
leningrad
during
the
war
.
not
shot
or
anything
.
just
froze
to
death
.
'
by
now
i
was
quite
fascinated
.
i
said
'who
told
you
all
that'
'about
the
birds
'
he
said
and
suddenly
he
changed
completely
his
face
suffused
by
a
kind
of
sly
cunning
.
'why
werner
told
me
.
he
knew
all
about
birds
.
'
'and
who
was
werner'
'werner
'
he
blinked
several
times
the
vacant
look
appearing
on
his
face
again
though
whether
genuine
or
simulated
it
was
impossible
to
tell
.
'he
was
a
good
lad
werner
.
a
good
lad
.
they
should
n't
have
done
that
to
him
.
'
he
leaned
over
his
spade
and
started
to
dig
again
dismissing
me
completely
.
i
stayed
there
for
a
moment
longer
but
it
was
obvious
that
he
had
nothing
more
to
say
so
reluctantly
because
it
had
certainly
sounded
as
if
it
might
be
a
good
story
i
turned
and
worked
my
way
through
the
tombstones
to
the
main
entrance
.
i
paused
inside
the
porch
.
there
was
a
notice-board
on
the
wall
in
some
sort
of
dark
wood
the
lettering
in
faded
gold
paint
.
church
of
st.
mary
and
all
the
saints
studley
constable
across
the
top
and
underneath
the
times
for
mass
and
confession
.
at
the
bottom
it
said
father
philip
vereker
s.j
.
the
door
was
oak
and
very
old
held
together
by
iron
bands
studded
with
bolts
.
the
handle
was
a
bronze
lion
's
head
with
a
large
ring
in
its
mouth
and
the
ring
had
to
be
turned
to
one
side
before
the
door
opened
which
it
did
finally
with
a
slight
eerie
creaking
.
i
had
expected
darkness
and
gloom
inside
but
instead
found
what
was
in
effect
a
medieval
cathedral
in
miniature
flooded
with
light
and
astonishingly
spacious
.
the
nave
arcades
were
superb
great
norman
pillars
soaring
up
to
an
incredible
wooden
roof
richly
carved
with
an
assortment
of
figures
human
and
animal
which
were
really
in
quite
remarkable
condition
.
a
row
of
round
clerestory
windows
on
either
side
at
roof
level
were
responsible
for
a
great
deal
of
the
light
which
had
so
surprised
me
.
there
was
a
beautiful
stone
font
and
on
the
wall
beside
it
a
painted
board
listed
all
the
priests
who
had
served
over
the
years
starting
with
a
rafe
de
courcey
in
1132
and
ending
with
vereker
again
who
had
taken
over
in
1943
.
beyond
was
a
small
dark
chapel
candles
flickering
in
front
of
an
image
of
the
virgin
mary
that
seemed
to
float
there
in
the
half-light
.
i
walked
past
it
and
down
the
centre
aisle
between
the
pews
.
it
was
very
quiet
only
the
ruby
light
of
the
sanctuary
lamp
a
fifteenth-century
christ
high
on
his
cross
down
by
the
altar
rain
drumming
against
the
high
windows
.
there
was
a
scrape
of
a
foot
on
stone
behind
me
and
a
dry
firm
voice
said
'can
i
help
you'
i
turned
and
found
a
priest
standing
in
the
entrance
of
the
lady
chapel
a
tall
gaunt
man
in
a
faded
black
cassock
.
he
had
iron-grey
hair
cropped
close
to
the
skull
and
the
eyes
were
set
deep
in
their
sockets
as
if
he
had
been
recently
ill
an
impression
heightened
by
the
tightness
of
the
skin
across
the
cheekbones
.
it
was
a
strange
face
.
soldier
or
scholar
this
man
could
have
been
either
but
that
did
n't
surprise
me
remembering
from
the
notice
board
that
he
was
a
jesuit
.
but
it
was
also
a
face
that
lived
with
pain
as
a
constant
companion
if
i
was
any
judge
and
as
he
came
forward
i
saw
that
he
leaned
heavily
on
a
blackthorn
stick
and
dragged
his
left
foot
.
'father
vereker'
'that
's
right
.
'
'i
was
talking
to
the
old
man
out
there
the
sexton
.
'
'ah
yes
laker
armsby
.
'
'if
that
's
his
name
.
he
thought
you
might
be
able
to
help
me
.
'
i
held
out
my
hand
.
'my
name
's
higgins
by
the
way
.
jack
higgins
.
i
'm
a
writer
.
'
he
hesitated
slightly
before
shaking
hands
but
only
because
he
had
to
switch
the
blackthorn
from
his
right
hand
to
his
left
.
even
so
there
was
a
definite
reserve
or
so
it
seemed
to
me
.
'and
how
can
i
help
you
mr
higgins'
'i
'm
doing
a
series
of
articles
for
an
american
magazine
'
i
said
.
'historical
stuff
.
i
was
over
at
st
margaret
's
at
cley
yesterday
.
'
'a
beautiful
church
.
'
he
sat
down
in
the
nearest
pew
.
'forgive
me
i
tire
rather
easily
these
days
.
'
'there
's
a
table
tomb
in
the
churchyard
there
'
i
went
on
.
'perhaps
you
know
it
'
``
to
james
greeve
...
''
'
he
cut
in
on
me
instantly
.
'
...
who
was
assistant
to
sir
cloudesley
shovel
in
burning
ye
ships
in
ye
port
of
tripoly
in
``
barbary
january
fourteenth
sixteen
seventy-six
.
''
'
he
showed
that
he
could
smile
.
'but
that
's
a
famous
inscription
in
these
parts
.
'
'according
to
my
researches
when
greeve
was
captain
of
the
orange
tree
he
had
a
mate
called
charles
gascoigne
who
later
became
a
captain
in
the
navy
.
he
died
of
an
old
wound
in
sixteen-eighty-three
and
it
seems
greeve
had
him
brought
up
to
cley
to
be
buried
.
'
'i
see
'
he
said
politely
but
without
any
particular
interest
.
in
fact
there
was
almost
a
hint
of
impatience
in
his
voice
.
'there
's
no
trace
of
him
in
cley
churchyard
'
i
said
'or
in
the
parish
records
and
i
've
tried
the
churches
at
wiveton
glandford
and
blakeney
with
the
same
result
.
'
'and
you
think
he
might
be
here'
'i
was
going
through
my
notes
again
and
remembered
that
he
'd
been
raised
a
catholic
as
a
boy
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
he
might
have
been
buried
in
the
faith
.
i
'm
staying
at
the
blakeney
hotel
and
i
was
talking
to
one
of
the
barmen
there
who
told
me
there
was
a
catholic
church
here
at
studley
constable
.
it
's
certainly
an
out-of-the-way
little
place
.
took
me
a
good
hour
to
find
it
.
'
'all
to
no
purpose
i
'm
afraid
.
'
he
pushed
himself
up
.
'i
've
been
here
at
st
mary
's
for
twenty-eight
years
now
and
i
can
assure
you
i
've
never
come
across
any
mention
of
this
charles
gascoigne
.
'
it
had
been
very
much
my
last
chance
and
i
suppose
i
allowed
my
disappointment
to
show
but
in
any
case
i
persisted
.
'can
you
be
absolutely
sure
what
about
church
records
for
the
period
there
might
be
an
entry
in
the
burial
register
.
'
'the
local
history
of
this
area
happens
to
be
a
personal
interest
of
mine
'
he
said
with
a
certain
acidity
.
'there
is
not
a
document
connected
with
this
church
with
which
i
am
not
completely
familiar
and
i
can
assure
you
that
nowhere
is
there
any
mention
of
a
charles
gascoigne
.
and
now
if
you
'll
excuse
me
.
my
lunch
will
be
ready
.
'
as
he
moved
forward
the
blackthorn
slipped
and
he
stumbled
and
almost
fell
.
i
grabbed
his
elbow
and
managed
to
stand
on
his
left
foot
.
he
did
n't
even
wince
.
i
said
'i
'm
sorry
that
was
damned
clumsy
of
me
.
'
he
smiled
for
the
second
time
.
'nothing
to
hurt
as
it
happens
.
'
he
rapped
at
the
foot
with
the
blackthorn
.
'a
confounded
nuisance
but
as
they
say
i
've
learned
to
live
with
it
.
'
it
was
the
kind
of
remark
which
required
no
comment
and
he
obviously
was
n't
seeking
one
.
we
went
down
the
aisle
together
slowly
because
of
his
foot
and
i
said
'a
remarkably
beautiful
church
.
'
'yes
we
're
rather
proud
of
it
.
'
he
opened
the
door
for
me
.
'i
'm
sorry
i
could
n't
be
of
more
help
.
'
'that
's
all
right
'
i
said
.
'do
you
mind
if
i
have
a
look
around
the
churchyard
while
i
'm
here'
'a
hard
man
to
convince
i
see
.
'
but
there
was
no
malice
in
the
way
he
said
it
.
'why
not
we
have
some
very
interesting
stones
.
i
'd
particularly
recommend
you
to
the
section
at
the
west
end
.
early
eighteenth-century
and
obviously
done
by
the
same
local
mason
who
did
similar
work
at
cley
.
'
this
time
he
was
the
one
who
held
out
his
hand
.
as
i
took
it
he
said
'you
know
i
thought
your
name
was
familiar
.
did
n't
you
write
a
book
on
the
ulster
troubles
last
year'
'that
's
right
'
i
said
.
'a
nasty
business
.
'
'war
always
is
mr
higgins
.
'
his
face
was
bleak
.
'man
at
his
most
cruel
.
good-day
to
you
.
'
he
closed
the
door
and
i
moved
into
the
porch
.
a
strange
encounter
.
i
lit
a
cigarette
and
stepped
into
the
rain
.
the
sexton
had
moved
on
and
for
the
moment
i
had
the
churchyard
to
myself
except
for
the
rooks
of
course
.
the
rooks
from
leningrad
.
i
wondered
about
that
again
then
pushed
the
thought
resolutely
from
my
mind
.
there
was
work
to
be
done
.
not
that
i
had
any
great
hope
after
talking
to
father
vereker
of
finding
charles
gascoigne
's
tomb
but
the
truth
was
there
just
was
n't
anywhere
else
to
look
.
i
worked
my
way
through
methodically
starting
at
the
west
end
noticing
in
my
progress
the
headstones
he
'd
mentioned
.
they
were
certainly
curious
.
sculptured
and
etched
with
vivid
and
rather
crude
ornaments
of
bones
skulls
winged
hourglasses
and
archangels
.
interesting
but
entirely
the
wrong
period
for
gascoigne
.
it
took
me
an
hour
and
twenty
minutes
to
cover
the
entire
area
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
knew
i
was
beaten
.
for
one
thing
unlike
most
country
churchyards
these
days
this
one
was
kept
in
very
decent
order
.
grass
cut
bushes
trimmed
back
very
little
that
was
overgrown
or
partially
hidden
from
view
or
that
sort
of
thing
.
so
no
charles
gascoigne
.
i
was
standing
by
the
newly-dug
grave
when
i
finally
admitted
defeat
.
the
old
sexton
had
covered
it
with
a
tarpaulin
against
the
rain
and
one
end
had
fallen
in
.
i
crouched
down
to
pull
it
back
into
position
and
as
i
started
to
rise
noticed
a
strange
thing
.
a
yard
or
two
away
close
in
to
the
wall
of
the
church
at
the
base
of
the
tower
there
was
a
flat
tombstone
set
in
a
mound
of
green
grass
.
it
was
early
eighteenth-century
an
example
of
the
local
mason
's
work
i
've
already
mentioned
.
it
had
a
superb
skull
and
crossbones
at
its
head
and
was
dedicated
to
a
wool
merchant
named
jeremiah
fuller
his
wife
and
two
children
.
crouched
down
as
i
was
i
became
aware
that
there
was
another
slab
beneath
it
.
the
celt
in
me
rises
to
the
top
easily
and
i
was
filled
with
a
sudden
irrational
excitement
as
if
conscious
that
i
stood
on
the
threshold
of
something
.
i
knelt
over
the
tombstone
and
tried
to
get
my
fingers
to
it
which
proved
to
be
rather
difficult
.
but
then
quite
suddenly
it
started
to
move
.
'come
on
gascoigne
'
i
said
softly
.
'let
's
be
having
you
.
'
the
slab
slid
to
one
side
tilting
on
the
slope
of
the
mound
and
all
was
revealed
.
i
suppose
it
was
one
of
the
most
astonishing
moments
of
my
life
.
it
was
a
simple
stone
with
a
german
cross
at
the
headâwhat
most
people
would
describe
as
an
iron
cross
.
the
inscription
beneath
it
was
in
german
.
it
read
hier
ruhen
oberstleutnant
kurt
steiner
und
13
deutsche
fallschirmjãger
gefallen
am
6
november
1943
.
my
german
is
indifferent
at
the
best
of
times
mainly
from
lack
of
use
but
it
was
good
enough
for
this
.
here
lies
lieutenant-colonel
kurt
steiner
and
13
german
paratroopers
killed
in
action
on
the
6th
november
1943
.
i
crouched
there
in
the
rain
checking
my
translation
carefully
but
no
i
was
right
and
that
did
n't
make
any
kind
of
sense
.
to
start
with
i
happened
to
know
as
i
'd
once
written
an
article
on
the
subject
that
when
the
german
military
cemetery
was
opened
at
cannock
chase
in
staffordshire
in
1967
the
remains
of
the
four
thousand
nine
hundred
and
twenty-five
german
servicemen
who
died
in
britain
during
the
first
and
second
world
wars
were
transferred
there
.
killed
in
action
the
inscription
said
.
no
it
was
quite
absurd
.
an
elaborate
hoax
on
somebody
's
part
.
it
had
to
be
.
any
further
thoughts
on
the
subject
were
prevented
by
a
sudden
outraged
cry
.
'what
in
the
hell
do
you
think
you
're
doing'
father
vereker
was
hobbling
towards
me
through
the
tombstones
holding
a
large
black
umbrella
over
his
head
.
i
called
cheerfully
'i
think
you
'll
find
this
interesting
father
.
i
've
made
a
rather
astonishing
find
.
'
as
he
drew
closer
i
realized
that
something
was
wrong
.
something
was
very
wrong
indeed
for
his
face
was
white
with
passion
and
he
was
shaking
with
rage
.
'how
dare
you
move
that
stone
sacrilegeâthat
's
the
only
word
for
it
.
'
'all
right
'
i
said
.
'i
'm
sorry
about
that
but
look
what
i
've
found
underneath
.
'
'i
do
n't
give
a
damn
what
you
've
found
underneath
.
put
it
back
at
once
.
'
i
was
beginning
to
get
annoyed
myself
now
.
'do
n't
be
silly
.
do
n't
you
realize
what
it
says
here
if
you
do
n't
read
german
then
allow
me
to
tell
you
.
``
here
lies
lieutenant-colonel
kurt
steiner
and
thirteen
german
paratroopers
killed
in
action
sixth
november
nineteen-
forty-three
.
''
now
do
n't
you
find
that
absolutely
bloody
fascinating'
'not
particularly
.
'
'you
mean
you
've
seen
it
before
.
'
'no
of
course
not
.
'
there
was
something
hunted
about
him
now
an
edge
of
desperation
to
his
voice
when
he
added
'now
will
you
kindly
replace
the
original
stone'
i
did
n't
believe
him
not
for
a
moment
.
i
said
'who
was
he
this
steiner
what
was
it
all
about'
'i
've
already
told
you
i
have
n't
the
slightest
idea
'
he
said
looking
more
hunted
still
.
and
then
i
remembered
something
.
'you
were
here
in
nineteen-forty-three
were
n't
you
that
's
when
you
took
over
the
parish
.
it
says
so
on
the
board
inside
the
church
.
'
he
exploded
came
apart
at
the
seams
.
'for
the
last
time
will
you
replace
that
stone
as
you
found
it'
'no
'
i
said
.
'i
'm
afraid
i
ca
n't
do
that
.
'
strangely
enough
he
seemed
to
regain
some
kind
of
control
of
himself
at
that
point
.
very
well
'
he
said
calmly
.
'then
you
will
oblige
me
by
leaving
at
once
.
'
there
seemed
little
point
in
arguing
considering
the
state
of
mind
he
was
in
so
i
said
briefly
'all
right
father
if
that
's
the
way
you
want
it
.

good
not
great
it
was
an
enjoyable
read
but
i
had
a
hard
time
getting
into
it
.
it
jumped
around

made
it

great
book
and
great
fun
many
have
seen
the
movie
but
not
read
the
book
.
the
book
is
much
better
as
many
readers
can
guess
for
this
is
the
usual
case
.
the
book
has
more
twists
and
characters
that
are
not
in
the
movie
and
gives
a
better
sense
of
the
time
that
just
was
not
conveyed
in
the
movie
.
it
is
just
a
fun
book
to
read

great
book
watch
the
movie
too
.
although
not
true
to
the
book
the
movie
had
an
all
star
cast
.
if
you
think
the
price
of
either
is
too
high
then
do
n't
buy
it
.
remember
it
all
began
as
a
joke
an
insane
joke
.

one
of
the
author
's
first
books
and
was
published
in
hard
copy
many
years

.
i
recall
enjoying
the

because
this

incredible
book
when
i
first
started
this
book
i
got
sick
of
it
fast
.
i
read
reviews
and
saw
that
it
was
one
of
the
most
exciting
and
action
packed
novels
ever
.
since
it
was
my
first
time
reading
a
higgins
or
higgins-esque
novel
i
was
n't
aware
of
the
background
at
the
introductions
.
however
after
finally
reading
through
the
introduction
it
turned
out
i
was
wrong
.
the
book
kicks
off
action
not
that
deep
in
and
does
n't
stop
until
the
last
word
.
by
far
my
favorite
book
i
've
ever
read
.

could
n't
put
it
down
i
'm
a
bit
of
a
slow
reader
but
this
book
had
me
completely
glued
to
the
pages
.
two
days
this
book
was
simply
awesome
.
the
beginning
made
me
laugh
with
excitement
and
the
ending
just
made
me
wonder
more
.
the
book
is
a
flurry
of
action
with
politics
and
a
bit
of
romance
thrown
in
.
i
enjoyed
how
it
showed
the
human
side
to
the
german
soldiers
and
respected
them
for
more
of
what
they
really
were
instead
of
the
stereotypical
german
soldier
of
world
war
2
that
the
world
has
come
to
accept
.
the
character
development
was
great
and
may
i
say
that
these
guys
were
all
hardcore
and
the
plot
is
something
to
behold
in
and
of
itself
.
i
highly
recommend
this
book
to
all
history
lovers
and
look
forward
with
great
enthusiasm
to
buying
the
movie
as
well
.
read
this
book
you
'll
love
it

book
movie
were
excellent
i
read
the
book
back
in
the
late
70
's
when
i
was
in
the
u.s
.
army..i
was
serving
with
the
10th
special
forces
group
.
my
unit
was
specifically
trained
for
unconventional
warfare
such
as
the
type
depicted
in
the
book
and
movie
.
it
was
very
realistic
and
is
probably
one
of
the
best
examples
of
what
the
u.s
army
'green
berets
'
do
for
the
united
states
military
...
the
movie
was
quite
true
to
the
book
story
line..which
does
n't
happen
very
often..i
highly
recommend
reading
this
book
...
then
rent
the
movie
dvd
.

a
great
book
for
anyone
who
likes
historical
fiction
this
book
is
one
of
the
best
books
i
have
ever
read
.
i
picked
this
book
becuse
of
the
feature
film
'the

landed
'
.

book
was
much
better
than
the
movie
and
it
is
a
real
thriller
.
i
read
many
historical
fiction
books
and
i
think
this
is
one
of
my
new

very
good
plot
choose
this
one

an
excellent
work
of
historical
fiction
this
book
is
an
excellent
example
if
somewhat
slow
paced
to
begin
of
historical
fiction
.
from
the
meeting
where
the
plan
was
conceived
by
hitler
to
the
final
confrontation
at
the
end
this
book
is
one
that
takes
you
through
the
typical
stereotype
of
german
soldiers
to
an
excellent
tale
of
german
paratroopers
on
a
mission
to
capture
winston
churchill
.
the
story
starts
out
slow
and
comes
to
an
exciting
conclusion
that
is
not
to
be
missed
by
anyone
enjoying
other
works
of
jack
higgins
or
the
historical
fiction
genre
.
