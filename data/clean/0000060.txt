see
all
my
reviews
i
've
read
the
book
and
the
movie
's
not
so
bad
.
obviously
there
are
many
things
i
'd
do
different
but
in
the
end
it
's
25
hours
of
good
entertainment
and
is
n't
that
what
the
ratings
are
all
about
personally
i
think
tom
hanks
was
n't
passionate
enough
for
robert
langdon
.
that
's
why
it
's
not
a
9
for
me.a
lot
of
people
are
too
harsh
on
this
one
.
mostly
because
they
know
the
book
and
have
very
high
expectations
.
i
have
to
see
my
first
book-to-film
where
the
film
is
better.also
you
're
not
going
to
hell
for
watching
this
movie
or
reading
the
book
.
it
's
based
on
a
novel
which
is
based
on
a
few
loose
theories
but
in
the
end
all
it
wants
to
do
is
to
entertain
.
and
that
is
exactly
what
both
the
book
and
the
movie
did
for
me
.
