chapter
one
lucy
looks
into
a
wardrobe
once
there
were
four
children
whose
names
were
peter
susan
edmund
and
lucy
.
this
story
is
about
something
that
happened
to
them
when
they
were
sent
away
from
london
during
the
war
because
of
the
air-raids
.
they
were
sent
to
the
house
of
an
old
professor
who
lived
in
the
heart
of
the
country
ten
miles
from
the
nearest
railway
station
and
two
miles
from
the
nearest
post
office
.
he
had
no
wife
and
he
lived
in
a
very
large
house
with
a
housekeeper
called
mrs
macready
and
three
servants
.
their
names
were
ivy
margaret
and
betty
but
they
do
not
come
into
the
story
much
.
he
himself
was
a
very
old
man
with
shaggy
white
hair
which
grew
over
most
of
his
face
as
well
as
on
his
head
and
they
liked
him
almost
at
once
but
on
the
first
evening
when
he
came
out
to
meet
them
at
the
front
door
he
was
so
odd-looking
that
lucy
who
was
the
youngest
was
a
little
afraid
of
him
and
edmund
who
was
the
next
youngest
wanted
to
laugh
and
had
to
keep
on
pretending
he
was
blowing
his
nose
to
hide
it
.
as
soon
as
they
had
said
goodnight
to
the
professor
and
gone
upstairs
on
the
first
night
the
boys
came
into
the
girls
'
room
and
they
all
talked
it
over
.
``
we
've
fallen
on
our
feet
and
no
mistake
''
said
peter
.
``
this
is
going
to
be
perfectly
splendid
.
that
old
chap
will
let
us
do
anything
we
like
.
''
``
i
think
he
's
an
old
dear
''
said
susan
.
``
oh
come
off
it
''
said
edmund
who
was
tired
and
pretending
not
to
be
tired
which
always
made
him
bad-tempered
.
``
do
n't
go
on
talking
like
that
.
''
``
like
what
''
said
susan
``
and
anyway
it
's
time
you
were
in
bed
.
''
``
trying
to
talk
likemother
''
said
edmund
.
``
and
who
are
you
to
say
when
i
'm

go
to

''
``
had
n't
we
all
better
go

said
lucy
.
``
there
's
sure
to
be

if
we
're

''
``

.

it
's
about
ten
minutes

walk
from
here
down
to

dining-room
and
any
amount
of
stairs
and
passages
in
between
.
''
``
what
's
that
noise
''
said
lucy
suddenly
.
it
was
a
far
larger
house
than
she
had
ever
been
in
before
and
the
thought
of
all
those
long
passages
and
rows
of
doors
leading
into
empty
rooms
was
beginning
to
make
her
feel
a
little
creepy
.
``
it
's
only
a
bird
silly
''
said
edmund
.
``
it
's
an
owl
''
said
peter
.
``
this
is
going

be

place
for

i
shall
go
to

now
.
i
say
let
's
go
and
explore
tomorrow
.
you
might
find
anything
in
a
place
like
this
.
did
you
see
those
mountains
as
we
came
along
and
the
woods
there
might
be
eagles
.
there
might
be
stags
.
there
'll
be
hawks
.
''
``
badgers
''
said
lucy
.
``
foxes
''
said
edmund
.
``
rabbits
''
said
susan
.
but
when
the
next
morning
came
there
was
a
steady
rain
falling
so
thick
that
when
you
looked
out
of
the
window
you
could
see
neither
the
mountains
nor
the
woods
nor
even
the
stream
in
the
garden
.
``
of
course
it
would
be
raining
''
said
edmund
.
they
had
just
finished
their
breakfast
with
the
professor
and
were
upstairs
in
the
room
he
had
set
apart
for
them
--
a
long
low
room
with
two
windows
looking
out
in
one
direction
and
two
in
another
.
``
do
stop
grumbling
ed
''
said
susan
.
``
ten
to
one
it
'll
clear
up
in
an
hour
or
so
.
and
in
the
meantime
we
're
pretty
well
off
.
there
's
a
wireless
and
lots
of
books
.
''
``
not
for
me
''
said
peter
``
i
'm
going
to
explore
in
the
house
.
''
everyone
agreed
to
this
and
that
was
how
the
adventures
began
.
it
was
the
sort
of
house
that
you
never
seem
to
come
to
the
end
of
and
it
was
full
of
unexpected
places
.
the
first
few
doors
they
tried
led
only
into
spare
bedrooms
as
everyone
had
expected
that
they
would
but
soon
they
came
to
a
very
long
room
full
of
pictures
and
there
they
found
a
suit
of
armour
and
after
that
was
a
room
all
hung
with
green
with
a
harp
in
one
corner
and
then
came
three
steps
down
and
five
steps
up
and
then
a
kind
of
little
upstairs
hall
and
a
door
that
led
out
on
to
a
balcony
and
then
a
whole
series
of
rooms
that
led
into
each
other
and
were
lined
with
books
--
most
of
them
very
old
books
and
some
bigger
than
a
bible
in
a
church
.
and
shortly
after
that
they
looked
into
a
room
that
was
quite
empty
except
for
one
big
wardrobe
the
sort
that
has
a
looking-glass
in
the
door
.
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
room
at
all
except
a
dead
bluebottle
on
the
window-sill
.
``
nothing
there
''
said
peter
and
they
all
trooped
out
again
--
all
except
lucy
.
she
stayed
behind
because
she
thought
it
would
be
worthwhile
trying
the
door
of
the
wardrobe
even
though
she
felt
almost
sure
that
it
would
be
locked
.
to
her
surprise
it
opened
quite
easily
and
two
mothballs
dropped
out
.
looking
into
the
inside
she
saw
several
coats
hanging
up
--
mostly
long
fur
coats
.
there
was
nothing
lucy
liked
so
much
as
the
smell
and
feel
of
fur
.
she
immediately
stepped
into
the
wardrobe
and
got
in
among
the
coats
and
rubbed
her
face
against
them
leaving
the
door
open
of
course
because
she
knew
that
it
is
very
foolish
to
shut
oneself
into
any
wardrobe
.
soon
she
went
further
in
and
found
that
there
was
a
second
row
of
coats
hanging
up
behind
the
first
one
.
it
was
almost
quite
dark
in
there
and
she
kept
her
arms
stretched
out
in
front
of
her
so
as
not
to
bump
her
face
into
the
back
of
the
wardrobe
.
she
took
a
step
further
in
--
then
two
or
three
steps
--
always
expecting
to
feel
woodwork
against
the
tips
of
her
fingers
.
but
she
could
not
feel
it
.

falling
so
thick
that
when
you
looked
out
of
the
window
you
could
see
neither
the
mountains
nor
the
woods
nor
even
the
stream
in
the
garden
.
``
of
course
it
would
be
raining
''
said
edmund
.
they
had
just
finished
their
breakfast
with
the
professor
and
were
upstairs
in
the
room
he
had
set
apart
for
them
--
a
long
low
room
with
two
windows
looking
out
in
one
direction
and
two
in
another
.
``
do
stop
grumbling
ed
''
said
susan
.
``
ten
to
one
it
'll
clear
up
in
an
hour
or
so
.
and
in
the
meantime
we
're
pretty
well
off
.
there
's
a
wireless
and
lots
of
books
.
''
``
not
for
me
''
said
peter
``
i
'm
going
to
explore
in
the
house
.
''
everyone
agreed
to
this
and
that
was
how
the
adventures
began
.
it
was
the
sort
of
house
that
you
never
seem
to
come
to
the
end
of
and
it
was
full
of
unexpected
places
.
the
first
few
doors
they
tried
led
only
into
spare
bedrooms
as
everyone
had
expected
that
they
would
but
soon
they
came
to
a
very
long
room
full
of
pictures
and
there
they
found
a
suit
of
armour
and
after
that
was
a
room
all
hung
with
green
with
a
harp
in
one
corner
and
then
came
three
steps
down
and
five
steps
up
and
then
a
kind
of
little
upstairs
hall
and
a
door
that
led
out
on
to
a
balcony
and
then
a
whole
series
of
rooms
that
led
into
each
other
and
were
lined
with
books
--
most
of
them
very
old
books
and
some
bigger
than
a
bible
in
a
church
.
and
shortly
after
that
they
looked
into
a
room
that
was
quite
empty
except
for
one
big
wardrobe
the
sort
that
has
a
looking-glass
in
the
door
.
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
room
at
all
except
a
dead
bluebottle
on
the
window-sill
.
``
nothing
there
''
said
peter
and
they
all
trooped
out
again
--
all
except
lucy
.
she
stayed
behind
because
she
thought
it
would
be
worthwhile
trying
the
door
of
the
wardrobe
even
though
she
felt
almost
sure
that
it
would
be
locked
.
to
her
surprise
it
opened
quite
easily
and
two
mothballs
dropped
out
.
looking
into
the
inside
she
saw
several
coats
hanging
up
--
mostly
long
fur
coats
.
there
was
nothing
lucy
liked
so
much
as
the
smell
and
feel
of
fur
.
she
immediately
stepped
into
the
wardrobe
and
got
in
among
the
coats
and
rubbed
her
face
against
them
leaving
the
door
open
of
course
because
she
knew
that
it
is
very
foolish
to
shut
oneself
into
any
wardrobe
.
soon
she
went
further
in
and
found
that
there
was
a
second
row
of
coats
hanging
up
behind
the
first
one
.
it
was
almost
quite
dark
in
there
and
she
kept
her
arms
stretched
out
in
front
of
her
so
as
not
to
bump
her
face
into
the
back
of
the
wardrobe
.
she
took
a
step
further
in
--
then
two
or
three
steps
--
always
expecting
to
feel
woodwork
against
the
tips
of
her
fingers
.
but
she
could
not
feel
it
.

i
also
recommend
this
book
is
awsome
this
book
is
a
great
book
full
of
imagination
.
although
the
first
chapter
is
a
little
boring
once
you
read
the
second
chapter
you
wo
n't
be
able
to
put
it
down
.
this
book
was
written
by
an
author
c.s
.
lewis
from
england
so
there
will
be
a
few
unfamiliar
words
if
your
not
from
that
area
.
this
book
is
2
of
the
series
but
if
you
go
by
the
order
that
they
were
written
this
book
would
be
the
first
.
there
is
a
total
of
seven
books
in
the
series
.
these
books
are
the
magician
's
nephew
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
the
horse
and
his
boy
prince
caspian
the
voyage
of
the
dawn
treader
the
silver
chair
and
the
last
battle
.
that
was
my
review
of
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
.

fraudulent
advertising
i
love
chronicles
of
narnia
and
i
was
thrilled
to
find
a
version
allegedly
featuring
color
illustrations
.
this
nookbook
does
not
feature
color
illustrations
despite
this
claim
in
the
synopsis
``
includes
19
new
full-color
plates
by
pauline
baynes
the
original
illustrator
of
the
chronicles
of
narnia
.
''
the
traditional
black-and-white
illustrations
are
present
but
no
color
plates
.
to
barnes
and
noble
it
is
extremely
frustrating
to
purchase
a
non-refundable
product
only
to
discover
after
the
fact
the
product
is
not
what
was
advertised
.
please
stop
misleading
ebook
shoppers
with
inaccurate
information

i
just
finished
reading
this
book
and
did
so
as
the
second
book
i
just
finished
reading
this
book
and
did
so
as
the
second
book
in
the
series
.
i
only
later
found
out
that
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
was
actually
published
first
and
that
many
fans
recommended
reading
them
in
the
order
in
which
they
were
published
.
this
would
be
something
to
consider
as
you
decide
which
book
to
begin
with.not
only
is
this
an
enjoyable
read
for
children
as
i
have
been
reading
these
aloud
to
mine
but
it
is
enjoyable
for
adults
.
the
language
and
the
way
c.s
.
lewis
writes
is
very
accessible
and
feels
like
you
entering
his
world
from
the
first
few
sentences
.
my
childrenrsquos
interest
has
not
waned
as
it
has
with
other
kids
books.another
attractive
aspect
of
these
books
is
the
underlying
christian
themes
.
they
help
one
understand
some
significant
events
in
the
bible
as
well
as
access
the
teachings
of
jesus
in
a
unique
way
that
makes
kids
think.due
to
the
accessibility
of
the
writing
and
the
creative
way
teachings
of
the
bible
have
been
woven
in
i
have
found
myself
becoming
interested
in
who
c.s
.
lewis
was
as
a
man
as
well
as
reading
his
other
works
.
i
would
highly
recommend
these
wonderful
books
written
by
such
an
interesting
man
.

thought

it

the

i
read

it

a
classic

fantastic
i
think
that
the
series
the
chroniclas
of
narnia
is
the
best
series
out
there
.
and
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
is
the
best
book
out
of
all
of
them
.
i
also
like
other
books
for
the
series
such
as
prince
caspian
and
the
voyage
of
the
dawn
treader
.
in
conclusion
i
think
it
doesnt
matter
if
your
under
10
years
old
or
over
50
you
will
enjoy
this
book
very
much
.

confusing
i
thought
that
this
book
was
alright
.
it
was
n't
the
best
book
i
've
ever
read
and
it
was
n't
the
worst
.
the
reason
i
liked
this
book
is
because
it
had
interesting
parts
but
in
the
middle
it
went
really
slow
and
i
got
lost
quite
often
.
this
is
a
book
about
four
children
named
lucy
edmund
peter
and
susan
.
the
littlest
one
lucy
discovers
a
wardrobe
with
a
magical
land
inside
called
narnia
.
the
land
is
filled
with
talking
animals
an
evil
witch
and
a
great
king
aslan
.
when
lucy
finally
gets
her
siblings
there
with
her
edmund
is
lured
into
the
hands
of
the
white
witch
and
her
friend
mr.
tumnus
is
gone
.
now
lucy
susan
peter
and
two
talking
beavers
have
to
make
a
journey
all
the
way
to
king
aslan
to
save
edmund
mr.
tumnus
and
all
of
narnia
.
this
book
is
filled
with
magic
and
that
's
why
i
recommend
this
book
to
all
fantasy
lovers
.

book
it
's
about
four

when

enyering
a
magical
word
.
on
a
quest
to
save
their
brother
edmund
a
lion
named
aslan
and
narnia
.
i
really
like
this
book
because
it
talks
about
how
they
try
to
figure
out
who
or
what
to
save
first
or
how
to
save
every
thing
at
tha
same
time
and
whats
more
inportant
to
them
because
they
have
to
save
aslan
their
brother
narnia
kill
the
white
witch
and
get
home
.
