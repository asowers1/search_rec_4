best
in

rare
ability
has
made
him
a
coveted
player
in
this

perfect
heist
cobb
and
his
team
of
specialists
have
to
pull
off
the
reverse
their
task
is
not
to
steal
an
idea
but
to
plant
one
.
if
they
succeed
it
could
be
the
perfect
crime
.
but
no
amount
of
careful
planning
or
expertise

team
for
the
dangerous
enemy
that
seems
to
predict
their
every
move

dominic
cobb
is
an
industrial
spy
who
instead
of
breaking
into
a
person
's
home
office
or
even
computer
gets
the
information
he
needs
by
getting
into
the
person
's
mind
through
their
dreams
.
cobb
is
also
a
fugitive
who
misses
his
children
.
someone
approaches
cobb
and
wants
to
hire
him
but
instead
of
getting
information
out
the
man
wants
cobb
to
implant
something
a
process
called
'inception
'
which
is
not
easy
to
do
.
cobb
is
hesitant
to
do
it
but
when
the
man
offers
to
help
cobb
go
back
to
his
children
cobb
agrees
.
so
he
assembles
his
team
but
when
they
begin
there
are
things
cobb
did
n't
tell
his
team
that
could
jeopardize
the
job
and
when
they
occur
they
're
not
sure
if
they
should
continue
.

dominic
cobb
is
the
foremost
practitioner
of
the
artistic
science
of
extraction
-
inserting
oneself
into
a
subject
's
dreams
to
obtain
hidden
information
without
the
subject
knowing
-
a
concept
taught
to
him
by
his
professor
father-in-law
dr.
stephen
miles
.
dom
's
associates
are
miles
'
former
students
who
dom
requires
as
he
himself
has
given
up
being
the
dream
architect
for
reasons
he
wo
n't
disclose
.
dom
's
primary
associate
arthur
believes
it
has
something
to
do
with
dom
's
deceased
wife
mal
who
often
figures
prominently
and
violently
in
those
dreams
or
dom
's
want
to
``
go
home
''
i.e
.
get
back
to
his
own
reality
which
includes
two
young
children
.
dom
's
work
is
generally
in
corporate
espionage
.
as
the
subjects
do
n't
want
the
information
to
get
into
the
wrong
hands
the
clients
have
zero
tolerance
for
failure
.
dom
is
also
a
wanted
man
as
many
of
his
past
subjects
have
learned
what
dom
has
done
to
them
.
one
of
those
subjects
mr.
saito
offers
dom
a
job
he
ca
n't
refuse
to
take
the
concept
one
step
further
into
inception
namely
planting
thoughts
into
the
subject
's
dreams
without
them
knowing
.
inception
can
fundamentally
alter
that
person
as
a
being
.
saito
's
target
is
robert
michael
fischer
the
heir
to
an
energy
business
empire
which
has
the
potential
to
rule
the
world
if
continued
on
the
current
trajectory
.
beyond
the
complex
logistics
of
the
dream
architecture
of
the
case
and
some
unknowns
concerning
fischer
himself
the
biggest
obstacles
in
success
for
the
team
become
worrying
about
one
aspect
of
inception
which
cobb
fails
to
disclose
to
the
other
team
members
prior
to
the
job
and
cobb
's
newest
associate
ariadne
's
belief
that
cobb
's
own
subconscious
especially
as
it
relates
to
mal
may
be
taking
over
what
happens
in
the
dreams
.

saito

cobb
to
do
the
reverse
not

information
but
plant
an
idea
in
a
rival
's
mind
.
in
return
he
'll
fix
problems
with
the
us
government
so
cobb
can
return
to
his
children
.
cobb
takes
the
near-impossible
job
planning
three
layers
of
dreams
within
dreams
for
the
mark
.
it
requires
a
larger
team
taking
a
powerful
sedative
if
something
goes
awry
the
dreamers
may
not
awake
.
cobb
does
n't
tell
his
team
that
his
past
nurtures
feelings
powerful
enough
to
bring
on
this
comatose
state

dom
cobb
is
able
to
use
his
unique
skills
to
his
advantage
-
he
can
enter
people
's
minds
through
their
dreams
and
thereby
learn
their
secrets
.
he
is
a
thief
for
hire
but
japanese
businessman
mr.
saito
has
a
somewhat
different
proposition
for
him
.
he
wants
cobb
to
enter
the
mind
of
robert
fischer
jr.
who
is
about
to
inherit
his
father
's
massive
business
empire
to
plant
a
simple
notion
to
break-up
his
father
's
conglomerate
and
sell
it
off
.
in
return
saito
will
make
it
possible
for
cobb
to
freely
return
to
the
us
where
he
is
currently
wanted
by
the
police
.
cobb
accepts
and
assembles
his
team
with
a
plan
to
plant
the
idea
deep
in
fisher
's
mind
by
generating
a
series
of
dreams
within
dreams
so
that
he
eventually
thinks
he
came
up
with
the
idea
himself
.
as
the
intended
deception
grows
ever
more
complex
cobb
has
to
deal
with
his
own
emotions
and
feelings
of
guilt
which
are
projecting
themselves
into
the
dreamspace
.
cobb
has
to
deal
with
the
eventual
question
of
what
is
real
and
what
is
only
a
