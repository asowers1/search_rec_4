that

reminds

reminding

of
what
happened
to

a
number
of
flashbacks
to
his

many
of
these
are
events
that
occurred
in

his

energy
to

's
hydra
energy
weapons
as
seen
in

when
phil
coulson
tries
to
contact
tony
stark
in
stark
tower
stark
claims
that
``
this
is
the
life
model
decoy
of

''
this
is
a
reference
to
life
model
decoys
lmds
that
appear
in

as
duplicates
for
characters
.
tony
stark
reminds
phil
coulson
that
he
was
``
unsuitable
''
for
the
avengers
initiative
as
stated
in
nick
fury
's
evaluation
file
on
tony
at
the
end
of
iron
man
2
.
instead
he
remains
a
consultant
.
the
footage
that
steve
watches
about
bruce
banner
when
flying
on
quinjet
with
coulson
is
a
scene
taken
directly
from
the
incredible

when
thor
returns
to
earth
loki
asks
him
how
much
dark
energy
odin
had
to
use
to
send
him
there
confirming
that
the
bifrost
is
still
destroyed
.
phil
coulson
refers
to
the
destroyer
's
attack
on
new
mexico
depicted
in
thor
and
reveals
that
s.h.i.e.l.d
.
is
developing
weapons
made
from
parts
of
it
.
bruce
banner
refers
to
his
fight
with
abomination
in
the
incredible

when
stark
offers
a
visit
to
stark
tower
saying
``
thanks
but
last
time
i
was

of
broke
...
harlem
.
''
bruce
banner
is
said
to
have
avoided
a
hulk
incident
for
over
a
year
meaning
that
the
events
of
the
avengers
take
place
over
a
year
after
the
incredible
hulk
.
during
this
time
he
has
spent
his
time
travelling
asia
to
help
the
sickly

scene
reveals
that

the

setting
him
up
as
the

with

echoes
much
to
stark
's
dismay
the
extended
opening
sequence
of
iron

as
seen
on
the
blu-ray
.
bruce

in
