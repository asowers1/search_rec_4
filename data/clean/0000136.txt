jack
the
men
are
using
huge
battery
powered
bright
white
flash
lights
that
look
like
they
're
from
jurassic
park
.
back
then
they
would
have
produced
yellow
light
.
the
light
used
in
the
movie
was
a
short-arc
xenon
bulb
you
can
tell
this
by
both
the
very
high
color
temperature
of
the
light
and
the
center
of
the
light
has
a
``
hole
''
in
it
where
the
actual
tube
is
blocking
the
beam
.
such
technology
was
not
around
at
that
time

deliberate
mistake
in
the
scene
at
the
start
of
the
movie
with
the
``
authentic
''
piece
of
film
you
can
see
a
girl
with
a
hat
waving
to
the
people
at
the
ground
.
when
the
ship
is
leaving
port
in
the
film
she
and
others
are
in
the
same
positions
only
in
reverse
because
the
first
``
authentic
''
shot
is
the
same
shot
only
reversed
.

smashing
all
the
glass
out
from
the
holder
she
grabs
the
axe
and
turns
round
.
the
next
camera
shot
shows
rose
standing
in
front
of
the
case
with
almost
all
of
its
glass
intact
.

in
the
scene
where
rose
breaks
jack
's
handcuffs
you
can
visibly
see
the
stunt
person
not
wearing
suspenders
as
jack
does
.
this
is
an
inter
cut
shot
between
the
raising
of
the
ax
and
the
striking
of
the
cuffs
.
leonardo
's
stunt

is
noticeable
in

's

the
first

you
see
her

the
lake
that
jack
told
rose
he
went
ice
fishing
on
when
she
was
threatening
to
jump
is
lake
wissota
a
man-made
lake
in
wisconsin
near
chippewa
falls
where
jack
grew
up
.
the
lake
was
only
filled
with
water
in
1918
when
a
power
company
built
a
dam
on
the
chippewa
river
six
years
after
the
titanic
sank
.

the
drawing
scene
'jack

is
using
modern
square
sided
pressed
charcoal
with
numbers
embossed
in
the
side
of
it
.
in
1912
jack
would
have
been
using
vine
charcoal
which
was
round
and
made
of
'charcoalized
'
willow
twigs
.

there
's
a

of
people
saying
goodbye
to
the
ones
that
are
going
to
leave
the
city

in
the
following
shots
you
can
see
jack
and
his
friends
playing
cards
inside
the
pub
.
if
you
look
through

window
you
wo
n't

in

when
jack
leaves
the
pub
the

is
there
again
.

jack
wins
the
tickets
for
the
voyage
his
hand-rolled
cigarette
is
thin

almost
done
just
before

molly

molly
is

they

colonel
if
there

the
woman
on

who
looks
kind
of
pathetic
is
then
later
seen
on

with
molly
brown
.
they
show
her
face
right
after
molly
says
the
line
``
its
your

''
the
life
boat
with
molly
brown
in
it
was
sent
out
before
the
scene
with
the
colonel
meaning
that
she
must
have

deck

using
the
second

the
deck
.
when
jack
lets
go
of
the
door
it
is
able
to
hit
the
side
of
the
deckhouse
.
on
the
actual
titanic
there
were
walls
on
the
bow
side
of
each
door
which
supported
an
overhang
above
the
entrance
.
this
is
not
included

revealing

many
scenes
used
computer
graphics
to
show
the
length
of
the
ship
.
passengers
were
also
added
walking
on
deck
.
the
shadows
for
the
passengers
do
n't
always
match
.
sometimes
the
angle
of
the
sun
distorts
shadows
.
so
the
shadow
of
a
woman
's
hat
appears
much
larger
than
the
actual
one
she
's
wearing
much
like
a
person
's
shadow
at
sunset
can
appear
to
be
that
of
a
giant
.

the
hymn
that
they
sing
at
the
church
service
about
``
those
in
peril
on
the
sea
''
has
four
verses
.
``
peril
on
the
sea
''
was
written
in
1860
but
the
verses
that
have
``
protect
them
by
thy
guarding
hand
''
and
``
o
spirit
whom
the
father
sent
''
were
not
written
until
1937
and
thus
could
not
have
been
sung
at
the
service
.

jack

the

pulled
up
a
bolted
down
bench
to
use
as
a
battering
ram
.
when
they
pulled
the
bench
loose
they
showed
a

the
wood
was
pressed
