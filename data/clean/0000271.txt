john

the
authorship
of
this
chart-topping
spine-tingling
hit
from
1965
's

lennon
maintained
that
mccartney
's
contribution
was
essentially
ringo

propulsive

a
key
element
in
the
production

prefigures
a

the
tune

precociously

even
as
it
reflects
the
nervous

lurking
beneath
that
soaring

hit

the
song
that
allowed
the

was
a
joint

lennon

it
sitting

of

this
exquisite
acoustic
ballad

soul

the
seemingly
straightforward
arrangement
features
harrison
on
sitar
his
first
use
of
that
instrument
on
a
beatles
recording
and
evidence
of
the
growing
interest
in
eastern
music
and
culture
that
would
have
an
influence
on
the
band
inside
and
outside
the
recording

lyrics
about
a
close
but
brief
encounter
with
an
independent
and
cosmopolitan
woman
are
pure
lennon
witty
a
tad
rueful
and
finally
poignant
without
stooping
to

the
simple

sumptuous
melody

journey

wry
jocularity

nine
weeks
in
that
position
in

after

with
his

wife
cynthia
mccartney

inspired
by
thoughts
of
the
couple

conceived
famously
as

the
resulting
plea
to
``

sad
song

make

''
seems
more
like
advice
to

lovesick
pal

it
has
been
speculated
that
the
increasingly
strained
relationships
in
