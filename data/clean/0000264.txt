been
said
they
restructured
pop
and
rock
music
as
we
know
it
more
than
once
during
the
brief
seven
years
that
they
made
records
.
they
were
at
the
center
of
a
pop-culture
revolution
thatâs
still
resonating
today
.
and
every
single
one
of
their
albums
â
from
1963â²s
debut
âplease
please
meâ
to
1970â²s
swan
song
âlet
it
beâ
â
is
a
classic

'tomorrow
never
knows'
from
'revolver
'
1966
once
the
beatles
committed
to
becoming
a
full-time
studio
group
they
wasted
no
time
exploring
the
various
shapes
and
colors
tucked
away
in
the
technological
corners
.
on
'revolver
''
s
closing
cut
they
tripped
out
with
backward
loops
sped-up
tapes
and
exotic
instruments
buried
in
the
mind-exploding
mix
.
49
'the
ballad
of
john
and
yoko'
from
1969
single
john
lennon
's
whirlwind
affair
with
yoko
onoâ
yielded
a
couple
experimental
records
a
ton
of
controversy
and
unparalleled
scrutiny
from
the
media
.
after
some
of
the
dust
on
the
matter
settled
lennon
wrote
a
song
about
it
chronicling
his
yearlong
misadventures
with
messianic
winking
frustration
.
48
'getting
better'
from
'sgt
.
pepper
's
lonely
hearts
club
band
'
1967
one
of
'sgt
.
pepper
's
''
melodically
cheeriest
songs
rides
an
undercurrent
of
melancholy
as
john
lennon
and
paul
mccartneyâ
trade
words
and
moods
on
the
chorus
.
'getting
better
'
like
much
of
the
album
was
spearheaded
by
mccartney
but
everyone
chips
in
here
.
47
'i
feel
fine'
from
1964
single
generally
credited
as
one
of
the
first
songs
to
include
deliberate
feedback
'i
feel
fine
'
helped
shape
the
beatles
'
declaration
of
independence
.
within
a
few
months
they
would
replace
their
traditional
forms
of
songwriting
to
include
more
studio
effects
and
audio
experiments
.
46
'all
my
loving
'
from
'with
the
beatles
'
1963
when
the
beatles
made
their
first
u.s.
appearance
on
'the
ed
sullivan
show
'
on
feb.
9
1964
this
was
the
song
they
started
with
.
the
two-minute
pop
explosion
served
as
a
perfect
intro
to
the
group
and
the
incoming
wave
of
beatlemania
.
45
'hello
goodbye'
from
1967
single
recorded
after
the
groundbreaking
'sgt
.
pepper
's
'
but
before
the
fractious
white
album
sessions
that
would
signal
their
breakup
'hello
goodbye
'
came
during
a
significant
period
for
the
beatles
--
still
a
band
but
now
one
where
paul
mccartney
's
voice
both
his
literal
and
metaphorical
ones
shines
bright
.
44
'from
me
to
you'
from
1963
single
one
of
the
group
's
earliest
songs
is
as
nostalgic
as
it
is
forward-looking
.
borrowing
songwriting
cues
from
the
beatles
'
rock
'n
'
roll
heroes
'from
me
to
you
'
sounds
like
a
tribute
to
the
music
's
formative
years
.
but
the
big
hook
driving
it
was
a
taste
of
things
to
come
.
43
'drive
my
car'
from
'rubber
soul
'
1965
in
the
u.k.
'drive
my
car
'
opened
the
game-changing
'rubber
soul
'
steering
straight
into
a
brave
new
world
for
pop
artists
.
staking
out
a
firm
identity
on
the
album
the
beatles
would
never
be
the
same
.
'rubber
soul
'
was
the
dividing
line
'drive
my
car
'
is
the
opening
shot
.
42
'you
've
got
to
hide
your
love
away'
from
'help
'
1965
the
beatles
met
bob
dylan
while
touring
the
u.s.
in
1964
.
he
introduced
them
to
marijuana
.
but
they
were
also
big
fans
of
his
music
especially
john
lennon
who
pretty
much
lifted
dylan
's
style
and
sound
on
'help
''
s
acoustic
centerpieceâ
'you
've
got
to
hide
your
love
away
.
'
41
'yellow
submarine'
from
1966
single
for
the
most
part
ringo
starrâ
covered
old
rock
country
and
pop
hits
on
beatles
albums
.
but
for
'yellow
submarine
'
john
lennon
and
paul
mccartney
handed
him
one
of
their
most
playful
songs
a
singalong
number
loaded
with
sound
effects
and
a
ton
of
psychedelic
fun
.
40
'nowhere
man'
from
'rubber
soul
'
1965
no
longer
content
writing
love
songs
and
singing
``
yeah
yeah
yeah
''
the
beatles
got
deep
on
'rubber
soul
'
penning
more
personal
cuts
fraught
with
emotional
baggage
.
john
lennon
's
'nowhere
man
'
peeks
into
the
soul
of
an
everyman
and
discovers
a
dark
lonely
chasm
.
39
'lucy
in
the
sky
with
diamonds'
from
'sgt
.
pepper
's
lonely
hearts
club
band
'
1967
john
lennon
has
always
claimed
that
the
inspiration
behind
one
of
'sgt
.
pepper
's
''
most
popular
cuts
was
a
drawing
by
his
son
.
but
he
is
n't
fooling
anyone
.
with
its
spaced-out
imagery
and
kaleidoscopic
soundscape
'lucy
in
the
sky
with
diamonds
'
is
an
acid
trip
for
your
ears
.
38
'this
boy'
from
1963
single
the
beatles
were
still
finding
their
footing
when
they
recorded
'this
boy
'
in
1963
.
released
as
the
b-side
to
'i
want
to
hold
your
hand
'
and
recorded
during
the
same
sessions
the
song
is
built
on
an
rb
rhythm
inspired
by
motown
legend
smokey
robinson
.
it
also
features
a
killer
vocal
by
john
lennon
.
37
'the
long
and
winding
road'
from
'let
it
be
'
1970
the
beatles
'
last
single
released
as
a
group
and
their
final
no
.
1
was
recorded
during
the
tumultuous
sessions
that
spawned
the
'let
it
be
'
album
.
it
's
one
of
paul
mccartney
's
most
gorgeous
songs
buoyed
by
phil
spector
's
majestic
and
controversial
strings
.
36
'we
can
work
it
out'
from
1965
single
recorded
during
the
'rubber
soul
'
sessions
and
released
as
a
single
the
same
day
as
but
not
included
on
the
album
'we
can
work
it
out
'
is
stuffed
with
the
wide-eyed
wonderment
that
graced
beatles
recordings
during
this
fertile
period
.
it
's
one
of
the
few
songs
john
lennon
and
paul
mccartney
wrote
together
after
they
hit
it
big
.
35
'taxman'
from
'revolver
'
1966
george
harrison
's
bitter
screed
against
british
tax
laws
and
the
people
who
enforce
them
opened
one
of
their
most
adventurous
albums
on
a
tough
sparring
note
.
in
addition
to
unveiling
the
magical
mysteries
of
'revolver
'
'taxman
'
ushered
in
a
new
era
of
creativity
for
the
so-called
quiet
beatle
.
34
'revolution'
from
1968
single
the
beatles
reworked
'revolution
'
so
many
times
during
the
troubled
white
album
sessions
that
three
versions
appeared
in
1968
a
bluesy
acoustic
crawl
found
on
'the
beatles
'
a
messy
sound
collage
also
on
the
lp
and
this
plugged-in
electric
version
which
was
released
as
a
single
as
the
b-side
of
'hey
jude
.
'
33
'paperback
writer'
from
1966
single
'paperback
writer
'
was
the
only
beatles
song
to
reach
no
.
1
in
1966
.
but
beatlemania
was
far
from
over
.
the
group
was
stretching
its
sound
--
check
out
the
fatter
bass
anchoring
the
track
--
and
boundaries
during
the
era
recording
the
mesmerizing
'revolver
'
before
moving
on
to
the
colorful
popscape
of
'sgt
.
pepper
's
.
'
32
'here
comes
the
sun'
from
'abbey
road
'
1969
'abbey
road
''
s
second
side
is
mostly
dominated
by
a
multi-song
suite
orchestrated
by
paul
mccartney
.
but
this
lovely
george
harrison
song
opens
the
side
with
a
beam
of
sunshine
that
carries
in
with
it
the
beatles
'
glorious
final
notes
.
31
'helter
skelter'
from
'the
beatles
'
1968
one
of
the
beatles
'
toughest
tracks
is
all
raging
guitars
scarred
vocal
cords
and
blistered
fingers
.
its
abrasive
tone
rocks
the
tranquility
found
elsewhere
on
the
white
album
while
still
being
an
integral
part
of
that
lp
's
sturdy-but-crumbling
structure
.
