followed
by
the
lost
symbol
the
da
vinci
code
is
a
2003
mystery-detective
novel
written
by
dan
brown
.
it
follows
symbologist
robert
langdon
and
cryptologist
sophie
neveu
after
a
murder
in
the
louvre
museum
in
paris
when
they
become
involved
in
a
battle
between
the
priory
of
sion
and
opus
dei
over
the
possibility
of
jesus
having
been
married
to
mary
magdalene
.
the
title
of
the
novel
refers
among
other
things
to
the
finding
of
the
first
murder
victim
in
the
grand
gallery
of
the
louvre
naked
and
posed
like
leonardo
da
vinci
's
famous
drawing
the
vitruvian
man
with
a
cryptic
message
written
beside
his
body
and
a
pentagram
drawn
on
his
chest
in
his
own
blood
.
the
novel
explores
an
alternative
religious
history
whose
central
plot
point
is
that
the
merovingian
kings
of
france
were
descended
from
the
bloodline
of
jesus
christ
and
mary
magdalene
ideas
derived
from
clive
prince
's
the
templar
revelation
1997
and
books
by
margaret
starbird
.
the
book
also
refers
to
the
holy
blood
and
the
holy
grail
1982
though
dan
brown
has
stated
that
it
was
not
used
as
research
material
.
the
da
vinci
code
provoked
a
popular
interest
in
speculation
concerning
the
holy
grail
legend
and
mary
magdalene
's
role
in
the
history
of
christianity
.
the
book
has
however
been
extensively
denounced
by
many
christian
denominations
as
an
attack
on
the
roman
catholic
church
and
consistently
criticized
for
its
historical
and
scientific
inaccuracies
.
the
novel
nonetheless
became
a
worldwide
bestseller1
that
sold
80
million
copies
as
of
2009update2
and
has
been
translated
into

louvre
curator

grand
master
jacques
sauniãre
is
fatally
shot
one
night
at
the
museum
by
an
albino
catholic
monk
named
silas
who
is
working
on
behalf
of
someone
he
knows
only
as
the
teacher
who
wishes
to
discover
the
location
of
the
``

''
an
item
crucial
to
the
search
for
the
holy

after

is
discovered
in
the
pose
of
the
vitruvian
man
the
police
summon
harvard
professor
robert
langdon
who
is
in
town
on
business
.
police
captain
bezu
fache
tells
him
that
he
was
summoned
to
help
the
police
decode
the
cryptic
message
sauniãre
left
during
the
final
minutes
of
his
life
.
the
message
includes
a
fibonacci
sequence
out
of
order
.
langdon
explains
to
fache
that
sauniãre
was
a
leading
authority
on
the
subject
of
goddess
artwork
and
that
the
pentacle
sauniãre
drew
in
his
own
blood
represents
an
allusion
to
the
goddess
and
not
``
devil
worship
''
as
fache
says
.
a
police
cryptographer
sophie
neveu
secretly
explains
to
langdon
that
she
is
sauniãre
's
estranged
granddaughter
and
that
fache
thinks
langdon
is
the
murderer
because
her
grandfather
's
message
said
``
ps
find
robert
langdon
''
which
she
says
fache
had
erased
prior
to
langdon
's
arrival
.
neveu
is
troubled
by
memories
of
her
grandfather
's
involvement
in
a
secret
pagan
group
.
however
she
understands
that
her
grandfather
intended
langdon
to
decipher
the
code
which
she
and
langdon
find
leads
them
to
a
safe
deposit
box
at
the
paris
branch
of
the
depository
bank
of
zurich
.
neveu
and
langdon
escape
from
the
police
and
visit
the
bank
.
in
the
safe
deposit
box
they
find
the
keystone
a
cryptex
a
cylindrical
hand-held
vault
with
five
concentric
rotating
dials
labeled
with
letters
.
when
these
are
lined
up
correctly
they
unlock
the
device
.
if
the
cryptex
is
forced
open
an
enclosed
vial
of
vinegar
ruptures
and
dissolves
the
message
inside
the
cryptex
which
was
written
on
papyrus
.
the
box
containing
the
cryptex
contains
clues
to
its
password
.
langdon
and
neveu
take
the
keystone
to
the
house
of
langdon
's
friend
sir
leigh
teabing
an
expert
on
the
holy
grail
.
there
teabing
explains
that
the
grail
is
not
a
cup
but
a
tomb
containing
the
bones
of
mary
magdalene
.
the
trio
then
flees
the
country
on
teabing
's
private
plane
on
which
they
conclude
that
the
proper
combination
of
letters
spell
out
neveu
's
given
name
``
sofia
.
''
opening
the
cryptex
they
discover
a
smaller
cryptex
inside
it
along
with
another
riddle
that
ultimately
leads
the
group
to
the
tomb
of
isaac
newton
in
westminster
abbey
.
during
the
flight
to
britain
neveu
reveals
the
source
of
her
estrangement
from
her
grandfather
ten
years
earlier
.
arriving
home
unexpectedly
from
university
neveu
clandestinely
witnesses
a
spring
fertility
rite
conducted
in
the
secret
basement
of
her
grandfather
's
country
estate
.
from
her
hiding
place
she
is
shocked
to
see
her
grandfather
having
sex
with
a
woman
at
the
center
of
a
ritual
attended
by
men
and
women
who
are
wearing
masks
and
chanting
praise
to
the
goddess
.
she
flees
the
house
and
breaks
off
all
contact
with
sauniãre
.
langdon
explains
that
what
she
witnessed
was
an
ancient
ceremony
known
as
hieros
gamos
or
``
sacred
marriage
''
.
by
the
time
they
arrive
at
westminster
abbey
teabing
is
revealed
to
be
the
teacher
for
whom
silas
is
working
.
teabing
wishes
to
use
the
holy
grail
which
he
believes
is
a
series
of
documents
establishing
that
jesus
christ
married
mary
magdalene
and
bore
children
in
order
to
ruin
the
vatican
.
he
compels
langdon
at
gunpoint
to
solve
the
second
cryptex
's
password
which
langdon
realizes
is
``
apple
.
''
langdon
secretly
opens
the
cryptex
and
removes
its
contents
before
destroying
it
in
front
of
teabing
.
teabing
is
arrested
by
fache
who
by
now
knows
that
langdon
was
innocent
.
bishop
aringarosa
realizing
that
silas
has
been
used
to
murder
innocent
people
rushes
to
help
the
police
find
him
.
when
the
police
find
silas
hiding
in
an
opus
dei
center
he
assumes
that
they
are
there
to
kill
him
and
he
rushes
out
accidentally
shooting
bishop
aringarosa
.
bishop
aringarosa
survives
but
is
informed
that
silas
was
found
dead
later
from
a
bullet
wound
.
the
final
message
inside
the
second
keystone
leads
neveu
and
langdon
to
rosslyn
chapel
whose
docent
turns
out
to
be
neveu
's
long-lost
brother
whom
neveu
had
been
told
died
as
a
child
in
the
car
accident
that
killed
her
parents
.
the
guardian
of
rosslyn
chapel
marie
chauvel
saint
clair
is
neveu
's
long-lost
grandmother
.
it
is
revealed
that
neveu
is
a
descendant
of
jesus
christ
and
mary
magdalene
.
the
priory
of
sion
hid
her
identity
to
protect
her
from
possible
threats
to
her
life
.
the
real
meaning
of
the
last
message
is
that
the
grail
is
buried
beneath
the
small
pyramid
directly
below
the
inverted
glass
pyramid
of
the
louvre
.
it
also
lies
beneath
the
``
rose
line
''
an
allusion
to
``
roslyn
.
''
langdon
figures
out
this
final
piece
to
the
puzzle
in
the
last
pages
of
the
book
but
he
does
not
appear
inclined
to
tell
anyone
about
this
.

explains
to
sophie

that
the
figure
at
the
right
hand
of
jesus
in
leonardo
da
vinci
's
painting
of
``
the
last
supper
''
is
not
the
apostle
john
but
actually
mary
magdalene
.
leigh
teabing
says
that
the
absence
of
a
chalice
in
leonardo
's
painting
means
leonardo
knew
that
mary
magdalene
was
the
actual
holy
grail
and
the
bearer
of
jesus
'
blood
.
leigh
teabing
goes
on
to
explain
that
this
idea
is
supported
by
the
shape
of
the
letter
``
v
''
that
is
formed
by
the
bodily
positions
of
jesus
and
mary
as
``
v
''
is
the
symbol
for
the
sacred
feminine
.
the
absence
of
the
apostle
john
in
the
painting
is
explained
by
knowing
that
john
is
also
referred
to
as
``
the
disciple
jesus
loved
''
code
for
mary
magdalene
.
the
book
also
notes
that
the
color
scheme
of
their
garments
are
inverted
jesus
wears
a
red
tunic
with
royal
blue
cloak
mary
magdalene
wears
the
opposite
.
according
to
the
novel
the
secrets
of
the
holy
grail
as
kept
by
the
priory
of
sion
are
as
follows
the
holy
grail
is
not
a
physical
chalice
but
a
woman
namely
mary
magdalene
who
carried
the
bloodline
of
christ
.
the
old
french
expression
for
the
holy
grail
san
grãal
actually
is
a
play
on
sang
rãal
which
literally
means
``
royal
blood
''
in
old
french
.
the
grail
relics
consist
of
the
documents
that
testify
to
the
bloodline
as
well
as
the
actual
bones
of
mary
magdalene
.
the
grail
relics
of
mary
magdalene
were
hidden
by
the
priory
of
sion
in
a
secret
crypt
perhaps
beneath
rosslyn
chapel
.
the
church
has
suppressed
the
truth
about
mary
magdalene
and
the
jesus
bloodline
for
2000
years
.
this
is
principally
because
they
fear
the
power
of
the
sacred
feminine
in
and
of
itself
and
because
this
would
challenge
the
primacy
of
saint
peter
as
an
apostle
.
mary
magdalene
was
of
royal
descent
through
the
jewish
house
of
benjamin
and
was
the
wife
of
jesus
of
the
house
of
david
.
that
she
was
a
prostitute
was
slander
invented
by
the
church
to
obscure
their
true
relationship
.
at
the
time
of
the
crucifixion
she
was
pregnant
.
after
the
crucifixion
she
fled
to
gaul
where
she
was
sheltered
by
the
jews
of
marseille
.
she
gave
birth
to
a
daughter
named
sarah
.
the
bloodline
of
jesus
and
mary
magdalene
became
the
merovingian
dynasty
of
france
.
the
existence
of
the
bloodline
was
the
secret
that
was
contained
in
the
documents
discovered
by
the
crusaders
after
they
conquered
jerusalem
in
1099
see
kingdom
of
jerusalem
.
the
priory
of
sion
and
the
knights
templar
were
organized
to
keep
the
secret
.
the
secrets
of
the
grail
are
connected
according
to
the
novel
to
leonardo
da
vinci
's
work
as
follows
leonardo
was
a
member
of
the
priory
of
sion
and
knew
the
secret
of
the
grail
.
the
secret
is
in
fact
revealed
in
the
last
supper
in
which
no
actual
chalice
is
present
at
the
table
.
the
figure
seated
next
to
christ
is
not
a
man
but
a
woman
his
wife
mary
magdalene
.
most
reproductions
of
the
work
are
from
a
later
alteration
that
obscured
her
obvious
female
characteristics
.
the
androgyny
of
the
mona
lisa
reflects
the
sacred
union
of
male
and
female
implied
in
the
holy
union
of
jesus
and
mary
magdalene
.
such
parity
between
the
cosmic
forces
of
masculine
and
feminine
has
long
been
a
deep
threat
to
the
established
power
of
the
church
.
the
name
mona
lisa
is
actually
an
anagram
for
``
amon
l'isa
''
referring
to
the
father
and
mother
gods
of
ancient
egyptian
religion
namely
amun
and
isis
.

criticism
of
the

code
the
book
generated
criticism
when
it
was
first
published
for
inaccurate
description
of
core
aspects
of
christianity
and
descriptions
of
european
art
history
and
architecture
.
the
book
has
received
mostly
negative
reviews
from
catholic
and
other
christian
communities
.
many
critics
took
issue
with
the
level
of
research
brown
did
when
writing
the
story
.
new
york
times
writer
laura
miller
characterized
the
novel
as
``
based
on
a
notorious
hoax
''
``
rank
nonsense
''
and
``
bogus
''
saying
the
book
is
heavily
based
on
the
fabrications
of
pierre
plantard
who
is
asserted
to
have
created
the
priory
of
sion
in
1956
.
critics
accuse
brown
of
distorting
and
fabricating
history
.
for
example
marcia
ford
wrote
regardless
of
whether
you
agree
with
brown
's
conclusions
it
's
clear
that
his
history
is
largely
fanciful
which
means
he
and
his
publisher
have
violated
a
long-held
if
unspoken
agreement
with
the
reader
fiction
that
purports
to
present
historical
facts
should
be
researched
as
carefully
as
a
nonfiction
book
would
be.4
richard
abanes
wrote
the
most
flagrant
aspect
...
is
not
that
dan
brown
disagrees
with
christianity
but
that
he
utterly
warps
it
in
order
to
disagree
with
it
...
to
the
point
of
completely
rewriting
a
vast
number
of
historical
events
.
and
making
the
matter
worse
has
been
brown
's
willingness
to
pass
off
his
distortions
as
âfacts
'
with
which
innumerable
scholars
and
historians
agree.4
the
book
opens
with
the
claim
by
dan
brown
that
``
the
priory
of
sion
â
a
french
secret
society
founded
in
1099
â
is
a
real
organization
''
.
this
assertion
is
broadly
disputed
.
some
critics
claim
that
the
priory
of
sion
was
a
hoax
created
in
1956
by
pierre
plantard
.
the
author
also
claims
that
``
all
descriptions
of
artwork
architecture
documents
...
and
secret
rituals
in
this
novel
are
accurate
''
but
this
claim
is
disputed
by
numerous
academic
scholars
expert
in
numerous
areas.5
dan
brown
himself
addresses
the
idea
of
some
of
the
more
controversial
aspects
being
fact
on
his
web
site
stating
that
the
``
fact
''
page
at
the
beginning
of
the
novel
mentions
only
``
documents
rituals
organization
artwork
and
architecture
''
but
not
any
of
the
ancient
theories
discussed
by
fictional
characters
stating
that
``
interpreting
those
ideas
is
left
to
the
reader
''
.
brown
also
says
``
it
is
my
belief
that
some
of
the
theories
discussed
by
these
characters
may
have
merit
''
and
``
the
secret
behind
the
da
vinci
code
was
too
well
documented
and
significant
for
me
to
dismiss
.
``
6
in
2003
while
promoting
the
novel
brown
was
asked
in
interviews
what
parts
of
the
history
in
his
novel
actually
happened
.
he
replied

a
detailed
rebuttal
of
the
main
arguments
of
dan
brown
and
those
of
michael
baigent
richard
leigh
and
henry
lincoln
who
authored
the
book
holy
blood
holy

in
the
program
the
real
da
vinci
code
shown
on
british
tv
channel
4
.
the
program
featured
lengthy
interviews
with
many
of
the
main
protagonists
cited
by
brown
as
``
absolute
fact
''
in
the
da
vinci
code
.
arnaud
de
sãde
son
of
gãrard
de
sãde
stated
categorically
that
his
father
and
plantard
had
made
up
the
existence
of
the
prieurã
de
sion
the
cornerstone
of
the
jesus
bloodline
theory
``
frankly
it
was
piffle
''
.
the
earliest
appearance
of
this
theory
is
due
to
the
13th-century
cistercian
monk
and
chronicler
peter
of
vaux
de
cernay
who
claimed
it
was
part
of
catharist
belief
that
the
earthly
jesus
christ
had
a
relationship
with
mary
magdalene
described
as
his
concubine.8
the
program
the
real
da
vinci
code
also
cast
doubt
on
the
rosslyn
chapel
association
with
the
grail
and
on
other
related
stories
such
as
the
alleged
landing
of
mary
magdalene
in
france
.
according
to
the
da
vinci
code
the
roman
emperor
constantine
i
suppressed
gnosticism
because
it
portrayed
jesus
as
purely
human
.
the
novel
's
argument
is
as
follows.9
constantine
wanted
christianity
to
act
as
a
unifying
religion
for
the
roman
empire
.
he
thought
christianity
would
appeal
to
pagans
only
if
it
featured
a
demigod
similar
to
pagan
heroes
.
according
to
the
gnostic
gospels
jesus
was
merely
a
human
prophet
not
a
demigod
.
therefore
to
change
jesus
'
image
constantine
destroyed
the
gnostic
gospels
and
promoted
the
gospels
of
matthew
mark
luke
and
john
which
portray
jesus
as
divine
or
semidivine
.
but
gnosticism
did
not
portray
jesus
as
merely
human.10
all
gnostic
writings
depict
christ
as
purely
divine
his
human
body
being
a
mere
illusion
see
docetism.11
gnostic
sects
saw
christ
this
way
because
they
regarded
matter
as
evil
and
therefore
believed
that
a
divine
spirit
would
never
have
taken
on
a
material
body.10

he
was
unaware

the
correspondence
was
a
coincidence.29

smith
also
hid
his

secret
code
in
his
written
judgement
in
the
form
of
seemingly
random
italicized
letters

spell
out

indicated

baigent

appealed

mikhail
anikin
a
russian
scientist
and
art
historian
working
as
a
senior
researcher
at
the
hermitage
museum
in
st
petersburg
stated
the
intention
to
bring
a
lawsuit
against
dan
brown
maintaining
that
he
was
the
one
who
coined
the
phrase
used
as
the
book
's
title
and
one
of
the
ideas
regarding
the
mona
lisa
used
in
its
plot
.
anikin
interprets
the
mona
lisa
to
be
an
christian
allegory
consisting
of
two
images
one
of
jesus
christ
that
comprises
the
image
's
right
half
one
of
the
virgin
mary
that
forms
its
left
half
.
according
to
anikin
he
expressed
this
idea
to
a
group
of
experts
from
the
museum
of
houston
during
a
1988
renã
magritte
exhibit
at
the
hermitage
and
when
one
of
the
americans
requested
permission
to
pass
it
along
to
a
friend
anikin
granted
the
request
on
condition
that
he
be
credited
in
any
book
using
his
interpretation
.
anikin
eventually
compiled
his
research
into
leonardo
da
vinci
or
theology
on
canvas
a
book
published
in
2000
but
the
da
vinci
code
published
three
years
later
makes
no
mention
of
anikin
and
instead
asserts
that
the
idea
in
question
is
a
``
well-known
opinion
of
a
number
of
