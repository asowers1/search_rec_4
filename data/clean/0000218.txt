what
's
the
storyin
the
second
adventure
shrek
voice
of
mike
myers
and
princess
fiona
cameron
diaz
are
blissfully
married
and
honeymooning
in
a
gingerbread
house
hansel
's
honeymoon
hideaway
.
when
they
get
back
to
the
swamp
donkey
eddie
murphy
is
waiting
to
welcome
them
home
but
trouble
begins
when
shrek
finally
meets
fiona
's
parents
king
harold
john
cleese
and
queen
lillian
julie
andrews
who
were
expecting
a
human
princess
married
to
prince
charming
not
two
big
green
ogres
.
the
queen
sees
how
happy
fiona
is
and
tries
to
adjust
but
the
king
pushed
by
fairy
godmother
jennifer
saunders
does
everything
he
can
to
get
rid
of
shrek
even
hiring
a
hit
man
or
more
properly
a
hit
cat
--
none
other
than
the
swashbuckling

antonio
banderas
.
but
the
bigger
obstacle
to
the
couple
's
living
happily
ever
after
is
shrek
himself
who
worries
that
fiona
would
be
better
off
married
to
a
handsome
prince
.
so
he
sets
out
in
search
of
a
magical
solution
.
and
before
we
get
to
the
happily-ever-after
ending
there
will
be
encounters
with
pinocchio
the
three
pigs
sleeping
beauty
and
the
gingerbread
man
and
a
bunch
of
new
characters
including
a
growly
voiced
wicked
stepsister
larry

and
a
very
vain
prince

is
it
any
goodquality
all
you
need
to
know
is
that
shrek
2
is
pure
enjoyment
with
stunningly
brilliant
technology
and
hilarious
performances
.
and
it
has
a
script
that
is
filled
with
wit
wisdom
heart
and
so-funny-you'll-have-to-see-it-twice
comedy
with
nonstop
humor
ranging
from
subtle
and
sophisticated
satire
to
unabashedly
un-subtle
slapstick
and
potty
jokes
.
the
movie
manages
to
make
fun
of
just
about
everything
including
its
fairy
tale
sources
and
yet
be
so
resonant
of
the
true
themes
of
fairy
tales
that
it
is
genuinely
touching
.
the
technology
continues
to
be
astonishing
.
the
surfaces
and
textures
are
eye-poppingly
vivid
almost
more
real
than
real
.
the
movie
has
breathtakingly
beautiful
backgrounds
exquisite
detail
and
characters
so
magnificently
yet
subtly
expressive
you
expect
to
see
them
interviewed
by
james
lipton
on
bravo
.
the
voice
talent
is
spectacular
and
perfectly
integrated
with
the
expressions
and
gestures
of
the
animated
characters
.
it
's
going
to
be
hard
to
think
of
the
dashing
and
brilliantly
funny
banderas
as
anything
but
a
cat
from
now
on
.
there
is
a
lot
to
look
at
but
there
is
even
more
to
feel
with
characters
so
tender
and
charming
that
you
will
cheer
for
a
happily-ever-after-ending
--
and
cheer
even
louder
at
the
announcement
of
shrek
