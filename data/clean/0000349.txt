1980
the
title
track
from
abbaâs
1980
album
hit
number
one
on
several
countryâs
charts
and
was
a
major
dance
hit
in
the
u.s.
its
opening
a
cappella
harmonies
lead
into
a
mid-tempo
charmer
thatâs
so
upbeat
in
mood
one
doesnât
initially
notice
itâs
a
song
about
loneliness
and
longing
.
very
abba
to
do
that

abba
1975
a

the
world
âs.o.s.â
reached
the
top
15
in
the
u.s.
and
the
top

in
canada
.
the
song
starts
out
with
a
feeling
of
melancholy
and
tension
both
in
the
music
and
in
agnetha
fãltskogâs
vocals
.
but
as
soon
as
the
chorus
hits
the
bouncy
music
overwhelms
any
doubts
that
this
singer
wonât
really
be
able
âto
carry

are
quickly
dispelled

more
blatantly

other

songs
it
sizzles
with
energy
and
is
an
awesome
song

dance

even

âwaterlooâ
waterloo
1974
abba
first
made
waves
with
1974âs
âwaterlooâ
which
won
that
yearâs
eurovision
song
contest
.
with
a
bouncy
and
extremely
singable
chorus
it
soared
to
number
one
in
numerous
countries
including
britain
and
made
the
top
10
in
the
u.s
.
when
all
was
said
and
done
six
million
singles
were
sold
and
abba
was
launched
to
stardom
.

1980
another
top
10
hit
in
the
u.s.
âthe
winner
takes
it
allâ
is
all
about
a
painful
breakup
.
written
at
the
same
time
as
the
divorce
of
abba
members
bjãrn
ulvaeus
and
agnetha
fãltskog
the
songâs
heartfelt
lyrics
seem
to
be
a
highly
personal
statement
.
itâs
also
a
major
highlight
of
âmamma
miaâ
the
stage
and
film
musical
drawn
from
abbaâs
song
catalogue
.

âfernandoâ
âfernandoâ
single
1976
âfernandoâ
is
often
considered
abbaâs
biggest-selling
single
racking
up
worldwide
sales
of
more
than
10-million
copies
.
and
deservedly
so
itâs
hard
to
resist
anni-frid
lyngstadâs
compellingly
tender
slightly
achy
solos
.
the
arrangement
with
its
airy
flutes
and
softly
strummed
guitars
creates
an
oddly
peaceful
setting
.
and
how
many
pop
songs
are
about
people
feeling
nostalgic
for
their
days
as
revolutionaries

âknowing
me
knowing
youâ
arrival
1976
breaking
up
is
hard
to
do
as
another
songwriter
once
said
but
itâs
handled
in
a
pretty
adult
manner
in
âknowing
me
knowing
you.â
the
matter-of-fact
lyrics
and
forceful
and
determined
arrangement
paint
a
clear
picture
this
heart
may
be
broken
but
itâs
better
off
that
way
.
the
message
resonated
worldwide
hitting
the
top
3
in
at
least
10
countries
.

âmamma
miaâ
abba
1975
although
not
a
major
hit
on
the
u.s.
charts
the
song
has
still
become
one
of
those
most
identified
with
abba
.
part
of
this
is
due
to
its
use
as
the
title
of
the
abba
musical
as
well
as
the
undeniable
catchiness
of
its
chorus
.
âmamma
miaâ
fared
better
initially
on
the
international
market
after
all
who
can
resist
a
song
that
features
a
marimba

âtake
a
chance

the
album
1978
at
least
14
countries
welcomed
âtake
a
chance
on
meâ
into
their
top
10
charts
.
the
songâs
distinctive
title
rhythm
derived
from
a
repetitive
phrase
bjãrn
ulvaeus
chanted
while
running
every
day
.
good
choice
when
combined
with
a
crystal
clear
euro-pop
production
and
those
trademark
abba
harmonies
itâs
an
enticing
alluring
sound
that
you
want
to
hear
over
and
over
.
