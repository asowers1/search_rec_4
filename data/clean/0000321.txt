reminded
the
world
just
how
profoundly
great
and
enduring
his
bandâs
music
is
.
in
homage
to
what
is
arguably
hard
rockâs
most
innovative
group
and
certainly
its
most
influential
what
follows
is
a
tour
of
50
of
the
most
celebrated
led
zeppelin
songs
with
a
focus
on
the
guitar
playing
songwriting
and
arranging
genius
of
the
quartetâs
visionary
founder
.
compiling
such
a
finite
list
presents
tough
choices
for
anyone
as
the
bandâs
recorded
output
of
great
music
during
its
heyday
was
impressively
prolific
by
any
standard
and
includes
well
over
50
gems
.
50.
âdâyer

houses
of
the
holy
this
lighthearted
but
heavy-sounding
song
the
title
of
which
is
intended
to
be
pronounced
âdâyou
make
herâ
was
conceived
as
a
playful
melding
of
a
fifties
doo-wop-style
repeating
chord
progression
and
the
quirky
syncopated
rhythms
of
jamaican
reggae
.

makes
good
use
of
sliding
sixth
intervals
on
the
songâs
verse
riff
providing
a
thin-textured
but
catchy
and
harmonically
effective
accompaniment
to
plantâs
vocals
.
his
guitar
solo
like
so
many
of
his
others
is
noteworthy
for
its
tasteful
lyrical
phrasing
and
emotive
use
of
bends
and
finger
vibratos

you
forgot
tea
for
one
.
people
often
forget
about
that
album
because
it
was
not
a
critical
success
.
i
would
take
off
d'yer
mak'er
and
replace
it
with
this
.
but
i
would
also
put
this
much
closer
to
the
top
because
it
is
some
of
the
most
amazing
blues
guitar
i
have
ever
heard
.
it
is
on
presence
.
it
's
great
to
see
in
the
light
on
here
though
.
most
people
miss
that
one
too
.
