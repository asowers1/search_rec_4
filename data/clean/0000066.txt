'the
song
âcominâ
throâ
the
ryeâ
asks
if
it
is
wrong
for
two
people
to
have
a
romantic
encounter
out
in
the
fields
away
from
the
public
eye
even
if
they
donât
plan
to
have
a
commitment
to
one
another
.
'
i
thought
the
'rye
'
referred
to
in
robert
burns
'
poem
was
the
river
rye
hence
the
lines
'jenny
's
a
wet
poor
body
jenny
's
seldom
dry
'
.
in
this
regard
it
is
about
two
people
who
meet
at
a
river
with
no
crossing
which
will
cause
people
to
question
why
one
of
them
is
wet
and
what
they
have
been
doing
.

to
have
been
left
out
on
this
page
.
it
is
very
useful
for
many
papers
and
is
a
very
important
quotation
chapter
25
towards
the
end
''
the
thing
with
kids
is
if
they
want
to
grab
for
the
gold
ring
you
have
to
let
them
do
it
and
not
say
anything
.
if
they
fall
off
they
fall
off
but
it
's
bad
if
you
say
anything
to
them
.

when
phoebe
gives
the
hat
back
i
think
it
also
symbolizes
her
not
wanting
to
be
caught
or
stay
as
a
child
or
something
